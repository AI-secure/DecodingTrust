# Overview

This tutorial aims to provide an overview of the configuration system of `DecodingTrust`. Our goal is to provide users with a simple entry (`main.py`) to execute selected (or all) trustworthiness perspectives 


# Installation

## (Conda +) Pip

```bash
conda create --name dt-test python=3.9
conda activate dt-test
pip install "decoding-trust @ git+https://github.com/AI-secure/DecodingTrust.git"
```

Please note that this will install PyTorch with `pip`. If your system does not have a `CUDA` version compatible with the `pip` wheel. Please install `PyTorch` with `Conda` first, as shown below.

```bash
conda create --name dt-test python=3.9 pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda activate dt-test
pip install "decoding-trust @ git+https://github.com/AI-secure/DecodingTrust.git@release"
```

If you would like to install an editable version, please clone the repository first.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI-secure/DecodingTrust.git
cd DecodingTrust
git checkout release
pip install -e .
```

Create a cache dir (by default the cached generations will be stored there)

```bash
mkdir ./.cache
```

Note that certain open source models (e.g. `Falcon`) require the PyTorch implementation of `FlashAttention` (`scaled_dot_product_attention`), `PyTorch >= 2.0` is required if you wish to run these models.

## Docker / Singularity

To use DecodingTrust with docker, simply pull the following docker image.
```bash
sudo docker pull danielz01/decoding-trust
docker run -it \
    -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container \
    --gpus all \
    decoding-trust/v1.0:latest [arg1 arg2 ...]
```
To use it in through singularity or apptainer container environments on HPC environments, simply run the following.
```bash
module load singularity  # Change it to whatever module name your singularity / apptainer environment was given
singularity pull decoding-trust-v1.0.sif docker://danielz01/decoding-trust
singularity exec --nv --bind /path/on/host:/path/in/container decoding-trust-v1.0.sif [arg1 arg2]
```

We will also have a build for `ppc64le` platforms soon. Stay tuned!


# Configuration

The `main.py` script uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for managing configurations. Our codebase comes with a `BaseConfig` that specifies general information like model names and secret keys. To avoid combinatorially many configuration files, we use a modularized scheme as the configure management. Each trustworthy perspective, e.g. adversarial robustness as `AdvGLUEConfig`, extends `BaseConfig` and stores its dedicated configurations in its separate folder under `./configs`. The configurations are defined in the `configs.py` script and registered with Hydra's `ConfigStore` in `main.py`.

You can provide input to the script through a YAML configuration file. This file should be located in the `./configs` directory. We have provided a default configuration set in `./configs`.

Concretely, the top-level main configuration file (`./configs/config.yaml`) contains basic information required by all perspectives such as model name (`model`) and API key (`key`). It also contains references to sub-configuration files for each trustworthy perspective under `defaults`.

We support three types of model name specifications.
+ OpenAI Models: `openai/model-name`
+ Huggingface Hub Models: `hf/namespace/repo-name`
+ Local Models: `hf/path/to/local/hf/repo`

```yaml
model: "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"
type: CHAT
conv_template: null
key: null
model_loader: HF
torch_dtype: BFLOAT16
quant_file: null
tokenizer_name: null
trust_remote_code: true
use_auth_token: true
dry_run: False
hydra:
  job:
    chdir: false
```

This is an example of the sub-configuration file for testing AdvGLUE++ data generated against an Alpaca base model, referenced in the top-level file as `adv-glue-plus-plus: alpaca`.

```yaml
sys: true
demo: false
data_file: ./data/adv-glue-plus-plus/data/alpaca.json
out_file: ./data/adv-glue-plus-plus/results/${model}/alpaca.json
no_adv: false
resume: false
save_interval: 100
remove_newline: false
task: ["sst2", "qqp", "mnli"]
```

# Running the Script

To run our evaluations with the default settings for each perspective, simply run `dt-run`.

## Running custom evaluations

### Run AdvGLUE++ as an example of classification

To run our evaluations with your custom configuration, you can simply override the argument in command line input. For example, to test AdvGLUE++ on adversarial texts generated by `Vicuna` (`./configs/vicuna.yaml`) instead of `Alpaca`, simply run

```bash
dt-run +key=sk-YourOpenAIKey advglue=vicuna
```

### Run RealToxicityPrompts as an example of generation

To evaluate toxicity on our sampled toxic prompts from RealToxicityPrompt, you can simply override the argument in command line input. For example, 

```bash
dt-run +key=sk-YourOpenAIKey toxicity=realtoxicityprompts-toxic
```

We can also easily change the evaluation dataset from RealToxicityPrompt to gpt-4 generated VERY TOXIC prompts with the following command:

```bash
  dt-run +key=sk-YourOpenAIKey toxicity=toxic-gpt4
```

### Run with your custom config


Alternatively, you can also compose a different configuration file in `./configs` and supply it to command line input.

```bash
  dt-run --config-name=another-config.yaml
```

# Output Format

We provide a unified output format for different trustworthiness perspectives. Take AdvGLUE++ as an example.  The output files will be written to `./data/adv-glue-plus-plus/results/model-organization/model-name` in the following format to record the raw model queries, raw responses, parsed results, labels, and scores for each task:

```json
