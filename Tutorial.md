# Overview

This tutorial aims to provide an overview of the configuration system of `DecodingTrust`. Our goal is to provide users with a simple entry (`main.py`) to execute selected (or all) trustworthiness perspectives 

# Configuration

The `main.py` script uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for managing configurations. Our codebase comes with a `BaseConfig` that specifies general information like model names and secret keys. To avoid combinatorially many configuration files, we use a modularized scheme as the configure management. Each trustworthy perspective, e.g. adversarial robustness as `AdvGLUEConfig`, extends `BaseConfig` and stores its dedicated configurations in its separate folder under `./configs`. The configurations are defined in the `configs.py` script and registered with Hydra's `ConfigStore` in `main.py`.

You can provide input to the script through a YAML configuration file. This file should be located in the `./src/dt/configs` directory. We have provided a default configuration set in `./configs`.

Concretely, the top-level main configuration file (`./configs/config.yaml`) contains basic information required by all perspectives such as model configuration (`model_config`) and API key (`key`). We also support specifying model configuration as a config group located in `./configs/model_config`.

We support three types of model name specifications.
+ OpenAI Models: `openai/model-name`
+ Huggingface Hub Models: `hf/namespace/repo-name`
+ Together Models: `together/namespace/repo-name`
+ Anthropic Models: `anthropic/namespace/repo-name`
+ Local Models: `hf//path/to/local/hf/repo`

```yaml
model: "hf/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
type: CHAT
conv_template: "llama-2"

model_loader: HF
torch_dtype: BFLOAT16
quant_file: null
tokenizer_name: null
trust_remote_code: true
use_auth_token: true

```

This is an example of the sub-configuration file for testing the Robustness perspective with AdvGLUE++ data generated against an Alpaca base model, referenced in the top-level file as `adv-glue-plus-plus: alpaca`.

```yaml
sys: false
demo: true
data_file: ./data/adv-glue-plus-plus/data/alpaca.json
out_file: ./results/adv-glue-plus-plus/${model_config.model}/alpaca-demo.json
no_adv: false
resume: false
save_interval: 100
remove_newline: false
task: ["sst2", "qqp", "mnli"]
```

# Running the Script

To run our evaluations with the default settings for each perspective, simply run `dt-run`.

## Running standard Decoding-trust evaluations

To run the standard Decoding-trust evaluations including all the perspectives, please refer to the example script `scripts/hf_example/dt.sh`, where we provide an example evaluating the default Llama model on all the perspectives.
You can also evaluate any perspective using the command provided in the example script.

## Running custom evaluations

### Evaluating the Robustness perspective with AdvGLUE++ as an example

To run our evaluations with your custom configuration, you can simply override the argument in the command line input. For example, to test AdvGLUE++ on adversarial texts generated by `Vicuna` (`./configs/vicuna.yaml`) instead of `Alpaca`, simply run

```bash
dt-run --config-name config +model_config=hf +advglue=vicuna
```

### Evaluating the Toxicity perspective with RealToxicityPrompts as an example

To evaluate toxicity on our sampled toxic prompts from RealToxicityPrompt, you can simply override the argument in command line input. For example, 

```bash
dt-run --config-name config +model_config=hf +toxicity=realtoxicityprompts-toxic
```

We can also easily change the evaluation dataset from RealToxicityPrompt to gpt-4 generated VERY TOXIC prompts with the following command:

```bash
dt-run --config-name config +model_config=hf +toxicity=toxic-gpt4
```

### Run with your custom config


Alternatively, you can also compose a different configuration file in `./configs` and supply it to command line input.

```bash
  dt-run --config-name=another-config.yaml
```

# Output Format

We provide a unified output format for different trustworthiness perspectives. Take AdvGLUE++ as an example.  The output files will be written to `./results/adv-glue-plus-plus/model-organization/model-name` in the following format to record the raw model queries, raw responses, parsed results, labels, and scores for each task:

```json
