# Overview

This tutorial aims to provide an overview of the configuration system of `DecodingTrust`. Our goal is to provide users with a simple entry (`main.py`) to execute selected (or all) trustworthiness perspectives 


# Installation

Before you start, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. To install all of our required packages, we recommend creating a new `venv` or `conda` environments.

We should start with installing our customized HELM repo, from which we will call HELM request to different chat models.

First, create a Python virtual environment with Python version == 3.9 and activate it.

Using Anaconda:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment.
# Only run this the first time.
conda create -n decodingtrust python=3.9 pip

# Activate the virtual environment.
conda activate decodingtrust
```

Clone our customized HELM repo and install,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielz02/helm
cd helm
./pre-commit.sh
cd ..
```

Clone our DecodingTrust repo and install the required packages as below
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI-secure/DecodingTrust
cd DecodingTrust
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a cache dir (by default the cached generations will be stored there)

```bash
mkdir ./.cache
```

Note that certain open source models (e.g. `Falcon`) require the PyTorch implementation of `FlashAttention` (`scaled_dot_product_attention`), `PyTorch >= 2.0` is required if you wish to run these models.


# Configuration

The `main.py` script uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for managing configurations. Our codebase comes with a `BaseConfig` that specifies general information like model names and secret keys. To avoid combinatorially many configuration files, we use a modularized scheme as the configure management. Each trustworthy perspective, e.g. adversarial robustness as `AdvGLUEConfig`, extends `BaseConfig` and stores its dedicated configurations in its separate folder under `./configs`. The configurations are defined in the `configs.py` script and registered with Hydra's `ConfigStore` in `main.py`.

You can provide input to the script through a YAML configuration file. This file should be located in the `./configs` directory. We have provided a default configuration set in `./configs`.

Concretely, the top-level main configuration file (`./configs/config.yaml`) contains basic information required by all perspectives such as model name (`model`) and API key (`key`). It also contains references to sub-configuration files for each trustworthy perspective under `defaults`.

```yaml
model: "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"
conv_template: null
key: null
hydra:
  job:
    chdir: false
defaults:
  - _self_
  - adv-glue-plus-plus: alpaca
```

This is an example of the sub-configuration file for testing AdvGLUE++ data generated against an Alpaca base model, referenced in the top-level file as `adv-glue-plus-plus: alpaca`.

```yaml
sys: false
demo: false
data_file: ./data/adv-glue-plus-plus/data/alpaca.json
out_file: ./data/adv-glue-plus-plus/results/${model}/alpaca.json
no_adv: false
resume: false
save_interval: 100
```

# Running the Script

To run our evaluations with the default settings for each perspective, simply run `main.py`.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Running custom evaluations

### Run AdvGLUE++ as an example of classification

To run our evaluations with your custom configuration, you can simply override the argument in command line input. For example, to test AdvGLUE++ on adversarial texts generated by `Vicuna` (`./configs/vicuna.yaml`) instead of `Alpaca`, simply run

```bash
python main.py +key=sk-YourOpenAIKey adv-glue-plus-plus=vicuna
```

### Run RealToxicityPrompts as an example of generation

To evaluate toxicity on our sampled toxic prompts from RealToxicityPrompt, you can simply override the argument in command line input. For example, 

```bash
python main.py +key=sk-YourOpenAIKey toxicity=realtoxicityprompts-toxic
```

We can also easily change the evaluation dataset from RealToxicityPrompt to gpt-4 generated VERY TOXIC prompts with the following command:

```bash
python main.py +key=sk-YourOpenAIKey toxicity=toxic-gpt4
```

### Run with your custom config


Alternatively, you can also compose a different configuration file in `./configs` and supply it to command line input.

```bash
python main.py --config-name=another-config.yaml
```

# Output Format

We provide a unified output format for different trustworthiness perspectives. Take AdvGLUE++ as an example.  The output files will be written to `./data/adv-glue-plus-plus/results/model-organization/model-name` in the following format to record the raw model queries, raw responses, parsed results, labels, and scores for each task:

```json
