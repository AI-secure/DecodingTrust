# Overview

This tutorial aims to provide an overview of the configuration system of `DecodingTrust`. Our goal is to provide users with a simple entry (`main.py`) to execute selected (or all) trustworthiness perspectives 

# Configuration

The `main.py` script uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for managing configurations. Our codebase comes with a `BaseConfig` that specifies general information like model names and secret keys. To avoid combinatorially many configuration files, we use a modularized scheme as the configure management. Each trustworthy perspective, e.g. adversarial robustness as `AdvGLUEConfig`, extends `BaseConfig` and stores its dedicated configurations in its separate folder under `./configs`. The configurations are defined in the `configs.py` script and registered with Hydra's `ConfigStore` in `main.py`.

You can provide input to the script through a YAML configuration file. This file should be located in the `./src/dt/configs` directory. We have provided a default configuration set in `./configs`.

Concretely, the top-level main configuration file (`./configs/config.yaml`) contains basic information required by all perspectives such as model configuration (`model_config`) and API key (`key`). We also support specifying model configuration as a config group located in `./configs/model_config`.

We support three types of model name specifications.
+ OpenAI Models: `openai/model-name`
+ Huggingface Hub Models: `hf/namespace/repo-name`
+ Local Models: `hf//path/to/local/hf/repo`

```yaml
model: "hf/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
type: CHAT
conv_template: "llama-2"

model_loader: HF
torch_dtype: BFLOAT16
quant_file: null
tokenizer_name: null
trust_remote_code: true
use_auth_token: true

```

This is an example of the sub-configuration file for testing AdvGLUE++ data generated against an Alpaca base model, referenced in the top-level file as `adv-glue-plus-plus: alpaca`.

```yaml
sys: false
demo: true
data_file: ./data/adv-glue-plus-plus/data/alpaca.json
out_file: ./results/adv-glue-plus-plus/${model_config.model}/alpaca-demo.json
no_adv: false
resume: false
save_interval: 100
remove_newline: false
task: ["sst2", "qqp", "mnli"]
```

# Running the Script

To run our evaluations with the default settings for each perspective, simply run `dt-run`.

## Running custom evaluations

### Run AdvGLUE++ as an example of classification

To run our evaluations with your custom configuration, you can simply override the argument in command line input. For example, to test AdvGLUE++ on adversarial texts generated by `Vicuna` (`./configs/vicuna.yaml`) instead of `Alpaca`, simply run

```bash
dt-run --config-name config +model_config=hf +advglue=vicuna
```

### Run RealToxicityPrompts as an example of generation

To evaluate toxicity on our sampled toxic prompts from RealToxicityPrompt, you can simply override the argument in command line input. For example, 

```bash
dt-run --config-name config +model_config=hf +toxicity=realtoxicityprompts-toxic
```

We can also easily change the evaluation dataset from RealToxicityPrompt to gpt-4 generated VERY TOXIC prompts with the following command:

```bash
dt-run --config-name config +model_config=hf +toxicity=toxic-gpt4
```

### Run with your custom config


Alternatively, you can also compose a different configuration file in `./configs` and supply it to command line input.

```bash
  dt-run --config-name=another-config.yaml
```

# Output Format

We provide a unified output format for different trustworthiness perspectives. Take AdvGLUE++ as an example.  The output files will be written to `./results/adv-glue-plus-plus/model-organization/model-name` in the following format to record the raw model queries, raw responses, parsed results, labels, and scores for each task:

```json

    "sst2": [

}
