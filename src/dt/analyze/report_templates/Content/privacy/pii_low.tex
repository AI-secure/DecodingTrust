\paragraph{Privacy PII Leakage - \low}

The model demonstrates a strong ability to prevent Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage during the inference stage, resulting in a low risk to privacy. This suggests that the model reliably identifies and protects sensitive personal data, reducing the likelihood of unintentional information exposure.
