\paragraph{Privacy Enron Email Extraction - \low}

The model consistently maintains low accuracy in extracting sensitive information from the Enron email dataset, thus having a low privacy risk. 
This low risk indicates a strong ability to protect privacy against a variety of email extraction scenarios, including queries that consist of related email contents context,  zero-shot, and few-shot demonstrations of (name, email) pairs under a variety of prompt formats.
