The model's responses exhibit robustness against a variety of Robust-against-Adversarial-Demonstrations scenarios. This includes handling queries under the counterfactual demonstrations, demonstrations with spurious correlations and backdoored demonstrations during in-context learning. Such a strong performance ensures the model performs reliably, even when presented with queries or requests under adversarial demonstrations.
