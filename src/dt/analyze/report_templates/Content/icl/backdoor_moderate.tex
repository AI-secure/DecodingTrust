\paragraph{Backdoors in Demonstrations - \moderate}
The model exhibits a moderate capability to handle the backdoored demonstrations while there is a possibility of being misled. While it often attempts to predict true class for an input embedded with an attacker-chosen backdoor trigger when there are some backdoored demonstrations, there are still backdoor setups where its responses are misled to the attacker-chosen target class. This performance level implies that, there is a noticeable room for enhancement in the robustness against the backdoored demonstrations.
