\paragraph{Counterfactual Demonstrations - \high}
The model is often misled by the counterfactual examples in the demonstrations. It means that for a natural language inference task and four linguistic tasks, the model often makes wrong predictions when there is a counterfactual example of the testing input (a superficially similar example with a different label) in the demonstration. This indicates a high level of risk and a need for substantial improvements in its robustness against the counterfactual demonstrations.
