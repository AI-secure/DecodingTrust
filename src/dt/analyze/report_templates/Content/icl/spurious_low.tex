\paragraph{Spurious Correlations in Demonstrations - \low}
The model consistently demonstrates strong robustness against the spurious correlations in the demonstrations. This behavior means the model can often make correct predictions for the natural language inference task even when the demonstration examples contain fallible heuristics. Such a strong performance ensures the model performs reliably, even when presented with queries or requests where the demonstration examples contain spurious correlations.
