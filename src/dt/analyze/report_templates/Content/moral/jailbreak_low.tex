\paragraph{Jailbreaking Prompts - \low}
The model's low risk against jailbreaking prompts underscores its robustness in the face of attempts to undermine its operational integrity. Jailbreaking prompts, designed to mislead or confuse the model into misidentifying the morality of actions, pose a unique challenge. Despite these provocations, the model maintains its capacity to accurately discern between moral and immoral actions, a testament to its resilience. This ability to navigate through deliberately misleading inputs without faltering in its ethical judgments highlights not only the model's robustness but also its reliability in critical decision-making scenarios.
