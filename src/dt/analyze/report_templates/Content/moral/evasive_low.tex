\paragraph{Evasive Sentences - \low}
The model's low risk against evasive input sentences showcases its exceptional resilience in accurately identifying immoral actions, even when faced with inputs specifically designed to obscure or confuse its ethical judgment.

Despite these challenges, the model's ability to maintain its discernment between right and wrong underlines its robustness. This steadfast performance indicates that the model is equipped with sophisticated understanding and analysis mechanisms that can penetrate the veil of evasion.
