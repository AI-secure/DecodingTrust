The model's responses exhibit robustness against a variety of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. This includes handling queries presented in uncommon styles, responding to unexpected inquiries that require knowledge beyond its training dataset, and adapting to OOD demonstrations during in-context learning. Such a strong performance ensures the model performs reliably, even when presented with queries or requests that differ from the data on which it was originally trained.
