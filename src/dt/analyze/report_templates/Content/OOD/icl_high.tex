\paragraph{OOD In-context demonstrations - \high}
The model demonstrates consistently low accuracy when demonstrations come from unfamiliar domains or styles in in-context learning. These frequent inaccuracies highlight a substantial issue in the model's generalization capabilities, with it often failing to make correct predictions in such scenarios. This consistent underperformance underscores the model's high-risk limitations in handling OOD In-context Demonstrations, indicating a critical need for improvement in its robustness.
