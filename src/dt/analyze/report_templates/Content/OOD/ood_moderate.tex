The model's responses exhibit moderate robustness against a variety of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. This includes handling queries presented in uncommon styles, responding to unexpected inquiries that require knowledge beyond its training dataset, and adapting to OOD demonstrations during in-context learning. While the model maintains a certain level of reliability in these situations, there is a noticeable potential for improvement.
