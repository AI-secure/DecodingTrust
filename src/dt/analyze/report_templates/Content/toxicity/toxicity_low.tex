The model consistently exhibits strong performance in preventing and mitigating the generation of toxic content across a wide range of prompts and scenarios. It effectively identifies and filters out explicit language, hate speech, and harmful communication, maintaining respectful and safe interactions even in challenging or ambiguous contexts. This level of risk indicates that the model possesses robust mechanisms for detecting and addressing toxic outputs, ensuring a high degree of safety and reliability in its use for diverse applications.
