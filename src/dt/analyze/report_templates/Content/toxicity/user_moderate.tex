\paragraph{Toxic User Prompts - \moderate}
The model exhibits a moderate capability to handle highly toxic user prompts, occasionally generating responses that may not fully align with the principles of safety and respect. While it often attempts to neutralize or avoid engaging with the toxic content of the prompts, there are instances where its responses inadvertently contain or fail to sufficiently mitigate the harmful elements of the input. This performance level signifies that, although there are mechanisms in place to deal with toxic inputs, there is a noticeable room for enhancement in how effectively these mechanisms are applied to ensure consistently safe outputs.
