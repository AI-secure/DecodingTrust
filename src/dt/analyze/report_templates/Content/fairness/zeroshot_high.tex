\paragraph{Fairness in zero-shot setting - \high}
The model demonstrates significant bias toward certain demographic groups, contradicting the ideal of equitable treatment across genders (male and female) and various racial groups. This discrepancy is particularly evident in a zero-shot setting, where the model operates without prior in-context examples. Therefore, the results suggest an inherent bias in the model's operations, highlighting a need for improvements to achieve fairness in its outputs.
