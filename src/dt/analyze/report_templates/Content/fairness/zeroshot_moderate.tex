\paragraph{Fairness in zero-shot setting - \mod}
The model displays a moderate level of bias towards certain demographic groups, suggesting a partial deviation from equitable treatment across genders (male and female) and racial groups. This observation emerges from its performance in a zero-shot setting, where the model functions without the guidance of in-context examples. Thus, while the model does not exhibit extreme bias, its outputs reflect a need for adjustments to enhance fairness and reduce disparities in treatment among different demographics.
