The performance of the predictive models demonstrates a moderate level of fairness, with some biases still observable towards certain demographic groups. While efforts have been made to reduce bias, salary predictions show a slight correlation with an individual's gender, and crime rate forecasts exhibit a minimal dependence on the predominant racial composition of a community. These findings suggest that, although progress has been made towards achieving fairness, there remains room for improvement. The models exhibit a balance between accuracy and equity, highlighting the ongoing need to refine them to further diminish biases and ensure more equitable outcomes across all demographic groups.
