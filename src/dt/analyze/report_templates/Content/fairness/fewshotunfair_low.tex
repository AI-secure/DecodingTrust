\paragraph{Fairness in few-shot setting with unfair contexts - \low}
When exposed to a limited number of examples within a context characterized by demographic imbalances, the model exhibits a minimal inclination towards favoring specific demographic groups. It delivers equitable responses across diverse genders (male and female) and racial categories. This behavior is observed in a few-shot learning scenario where the provided examples are inherently biased. Consequently, it implies that models functioning in such environments may be deemed as exhibiting fairness.
