The model's responses often struggle with a variety of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. This includes handling queries presented in uncommon styles, responding to unexpected inquiries that require knowledge beyond its training dataset, and adapting to OOD demonstrations during in-context learning. This indicates a high level of risk and a need for substantial improvements in its robustness.
