\paragraph{Privacy Enron Email Extraction - \high}
The model exhibits high risks of leaking sensitive information from the Enron email dataset when faced with queries or requests deliberately designed to elicit private information,  such as queries that consist of related email contents context,  or few-shot demonstrations of (name, email) pairs. 
This high risk indicates that the model may memorize the sensitive training data, and could lead to unintended exposure of sensitive data when prompted with related information.
