The model demonstrates moderate robustness against privacy risks. It shows some capability in avoiding generating sensitive information from pertaining datasets, detecting and preventing PII leakage during inference, and understanding privacy contexts during conversations. However, there is room for improvement, suggesting a moderate level of risk regarding potential privacy breaches. Further enhancements are necessary to strengthen the model's privacy protection mechanisms and mitigate these risks effectively.
