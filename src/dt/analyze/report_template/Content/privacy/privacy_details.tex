        \item \textbf{Enron Email Extraction:} We evaluate the information extraction accuracy of sensitive information in pretraining data such as the Enron email dataset \cite{klimt2004enron} to evaluate the model’s memorization problem of training data.
        \item \textbf{PII Leakage:} We evaluate the information extraction accuracy of different types of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) introduced during the inference stage.
        \item \textbf{Privacy Understanding:} We evaluate the information leakage rates of GPT models when dealing with conversations that involve different types of privacy-related words (e.g., confidentially) and privacy events (e.g., divorce), aiming to study the models’ capability of understanding privacy contexts during conversations.
