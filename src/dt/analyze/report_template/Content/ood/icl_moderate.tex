\paragraph{OOD In-context Demonstrations - \moderate}
The model demonstrates a moderate level of accuracy when demonstrations come from unfamiliar domains or styles in in-context learning. Although it often performs well, there are noticeable instances where it makes incorrect predictions, particularly when faced with demonstrations from unfamiliar domains or styles. This inconsistency suggests that the model is not uniformly robust across OOD In-context Demonstrations, indicating a need for improvement in its robustness.
