\subsubsection*{Out-of-Distribution Robustness}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{OOD Style:} We evaluate on datasets with uncommon text styles (e.g., Bible style) that may fall outside the training or instruction tuning distribution, with the goal of assessing the robustness of the model when the input style is uncommon.
        \item \textbf{OOD Knowledge:} We evaluate questions that can only be answered with knowledge after the training data was collected, aiming to investigate the trustworthiness of the modelâ€™s responses when the questions are out of scope. (e.g., whether the model knows to refuse to answer unknown questions.
        \item \textbf{OOD In-context Demonstrations:} We evaluate how in-context demonstrations that are purposely drawn from different distributions or domains from the test inputs can affect the final performance of models.
