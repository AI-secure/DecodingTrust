The model's responses often struggle with a variety of Robust-against-Adversarial-Demonstrations scenarios. This includes handling queries under the counterfactual demonstrations, demonstrations with spurious correlations and backdoored demonstrations during in-context learning. This indicates a high level of risk and a need for substantial improvements in its robustness against adversarial demonstrations.
