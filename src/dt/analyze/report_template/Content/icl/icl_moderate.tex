The model's responses exhibit moderate robustness against a variety of Robust-against-Adversarial-Demonstrations scenarios. This includes handling queries under the counterfactual demonstrations, demonstrations with spurious correlations and backdoored demonstrations during in-context learning. While the model maintains a certain level of reliability in these situations, there is a noticeable potential for improvement.
