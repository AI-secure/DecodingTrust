\paragraph{Spurious Correlations in Demonstrations - \high}
The model is often misled by the spurious correlations in the demonstrations. Specifically, it means that the model can make wrong predictions when certain fallible heuristics from HANS dataset are exhibited in the demonstrations. Such heuristics are statistically associated with the target labels but not causally related, which can mislead the model predictions. This indicates a high level of risk and a need for substantial improvements in its robustness against the spurious correlations in the demonstrations.
