\paragraph{Backdoors in Demonstrations - \high}
The model is often misled by the backdoored demonstrations. This behavior means the model can predict an attacker-chosen target class for an input embedded with an attacker-chosen backdoor trigger when some demonstration examples contain this trigger and are labeled as the target class. This indicates a high level of risk and a need for substantial improvements in its robustness against the backdoors in the demonstrations.
