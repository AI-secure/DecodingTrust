\paragraph{Backdoors in Demonstrations - \low}
The model consistently demonstrates strong robustness against the backdoored demonstrations. This behavior means the model does not predict an attacker-chosen target class for an input embedded with an attacker-chosen backdoor trigger under different backdoor setups of adding backdoored demonstration examples. Such a strong performance ensures the model performs reliably, even when presented with queries or requests under backdoored demonstrations.
