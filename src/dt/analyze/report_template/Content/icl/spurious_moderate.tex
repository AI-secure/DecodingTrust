\paragraph{Spurious Correlations in Demonstrations - \moderate}
The model exhibits a moderate capability to handle the spurious correlations in the demonstrations while there is a possibility of being misled. It means the model does not consistently predict correctly for a testing input of the natural language inference and sometimes wrongly leverages the fallible heuristics which are only statistically associated with the target labels. This performance level implies that there is noticeable room for enhancement in the robustness against the spurious correlations in the demonstrations.
