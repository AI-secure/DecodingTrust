\paragraph{Toxic System Prompts - \moderate}
The model demonstrates a moderate level of resilience against adversarial system prompts and jailbreaking attempts. While it successfully resists or mitigates many such challenges, preventing unauthorized or harmful behaviors in several scenarios, it remains susceptible to more sophisticated or nuanced attempts at manipulation. This performance suggests a respectable but imperfect set of defense mechanisms, highlighting opportunities for further strengthening its capabilities to detect, resist, and neutralize adversarial manipulations, thereby improving the overall security and reliability of its responses.
