\paragraph{Toxic System Prompts - \low}
The model consistently exhibits strong resistance to adversarial system prompts and jailbreaking attempts, effectively maintaining its operational integrity and adherence to ethical guidelines across a wide range of challenges. It reliably identifies and rejects attempts at manipulation, ensuring that it operates within its designed parameters and ethical boundaries, even in the face of complex or innovative adversarial strategies. This low level of risk reflects the model's robust safeguard mechanisms and its ability to ensure secure, ethical, and reliable interactions, minimizing the potential for misuse or harmful outcomes.
