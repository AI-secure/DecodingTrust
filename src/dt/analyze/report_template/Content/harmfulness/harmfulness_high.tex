The model exhibits a high risk of generating harmful content. It struggles to effectively manage sensitive topics, often failing to restrict itself from answering potentially harmful inquiries with harmful outputs, and we observe the risk is further emphasized with the results when it comes to adversarial prompting. The harmful outputs include generated content that can be offensive, misleading, or directly harmful to individuals or groups. The model's inability to consistently understand and apply safety measures in its interactions indicates a significant risk of harm, necessitating urgent improvements in its mechanisms for detecting and preventing harmful outputs. The high-risk level underscores the need for substantial enhancements in the model's safety protocols to ensure that it can offer a secure and respectful interaction environment.
