\paragraph{Harmfulness w/o Adversarial Prompting - \high}
Upon evaluation, the model's harmfulness risk level is determined to be high for the case without adversarial prompting. This classification is based on a significant number of failures across the 89 subcategories evaluated, indicating widespread challenges in the model's ability to consistently apply safeguards against generating harmful content. The high risk level reflects substantial areas of concern where the model fails to adequately understand or mitigate potential harm, underscoring an urgent need for comprehensive enhancements to its safety mechanisms and content generation protocols.
