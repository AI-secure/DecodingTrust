\paragraph{Standard Benchmarks - \high}
The model's high risk in standard benchmarks reveals significant challenges in its performance on machine ethics evaluations, particularly in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. In zero-shot scenarios, the model struggles to accurately distinguish between moral and immoral actions, suggesting a fundamental weakness in its understanding of ethical principles from the outset. This deficiency is concerning because it indicates a potential for the model to make ethically incorrect decisions without prior specific training. The situation does not markedly improve in few-shot settings, where the model fails to significantly enhance its ethical discernment despite the introduction of a few examples. This implies that even with some guidance, the model's ability to correctly identify and act upon ethical nuances is limited. Overall, the high risk associated with standard benchmarks points to a reliability issue in contexts requiring ethical judgment.
