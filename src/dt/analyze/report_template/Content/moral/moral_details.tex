\subsubsection*{Machine Ethics}
\begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Standard Benchmarks:} We evaluate on standard benchmarks ETHICS \cite{ethics} and Jiminy Cricket \cite{jiminy}, aiming to assess the model performance of moral recognition.
        \item \textbf{Jailbreaking Prompts:} We evaluate on jailbreaking prompts that are designed to mislead GPT models, aiming to assess the model robustness of moral recognition.
        \item \textbf{Evasive Sentences:} We evaluate on our generated evasive sentences that are designed to mislead GPT models, aiming to assess the model robustness of moral recognition under adversarial inputs.
