\paragraph{Jailbreaking Prompts - \high}
The model's high risk against jailbreaking prompts indicates a vulnerability in its defenses, making it susceptible to manipulation through specially crafted prompts. These jailbreaking prompts aim to confuse or deceive the model into misidentifying its capabilities or making unethical decisions. A high risk in this context suggests that the model often fails to maintain its ethical integrity and can be misled into distinguishing moral from immoral actions incorrectly. This vulnerability not only compromises the model's reliability in making sound ethical judgments but also raises concerns about its overall security and trustworthiness.
