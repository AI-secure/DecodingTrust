\paragraph{Jailbreaking Prompts - \moderate}
The model's moderate risk against jailbreaking prompts suggests a level of susceptibility to inputs crafted to challenge or bypass its ethical guidelines and operational framework. While the model is capable of resisting many such attempts, indicating a degree of robustness and understanding of its ethical boundaries, it is not immune to all forms of manipulation. In scenarios where jailbreaking prompts are designed to mislead or exploit the model's functionalities, it may exhibit inconsistencies in distinguishing between moral and immoral actions. This indicates that, although the model has mechanisms in place to counter some attempts at manipulation, there remains room for improvement in its defenses.
