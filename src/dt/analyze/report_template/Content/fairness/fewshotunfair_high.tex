\paragraph{Fairness in few-shot setting with unfair contexts - \high}
When exposed to in-context examples characterized by significant demographic imbalances, the model exhibits a pronounced bias favoring specific demographic groups over others. It consistently generates responses that are skewed towards particular genders (male and female) and racial categories, reflecting a substantial deviation from balanced representation. This pattern becomes evident in settings where the training examples themselves are steeped in bias. Hence, it indicates that models functioning under these circumstances display a marked bias, underscoring a critical need for intervention to address and mitigate these disparities to achieve equitable outcomes.
