\paragraph{Fairness in few-shot setting with fair contexts - \moderate}
When presented with a small collection of examples in a demographically balanced context, the model exhibits a moderate level of bias, indicating a slight preference towards certain demographic groups despite efforts to ensure balanced representation of genders (male and female) and racial groups. This outcome is observed in a few-shot learning scenario, where the examples provided are intended to be neutral and equitable. The presence of this moderate bias, despite a balanced contextual setup, suggests a need for further refinement to enhance the fairness of models in such conditions.
