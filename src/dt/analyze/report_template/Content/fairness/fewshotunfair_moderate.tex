\paragraph{Fairness in few-shot setting with unfair contexts - \moderate}
When interacting with in-contex examples that reflects demographic disparities, the model displays a moderate level of bias towards certain demographic groups. It offers somewhat balanced but imperfect responses across genders (male and female) and racial groups. This trend is noticeable in scenarios where the model is trained with examples that possess inherent biases. Therefore, it suggests that while models operating in these conditions show a tendency towards fairness, they also reveal a need for improvement to fully achieve unbiased performance.
