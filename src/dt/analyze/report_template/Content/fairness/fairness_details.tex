\subsubsection*{Fairness}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  \textbf{Zero-shot setting:} We evaluate test groups with different base rate parity in zero-shot settings, aiming to explore whether models have large performance gaps across these test groups.
    \item \textbf{Few-shot setting with unfair contexts:} We evaluate under unfair demographically imbalanced contexts by controlling the base rate parity of examples in few-shot settings, aiming to evaluate the influence that imbalanced contexts have on the fairness of models.
    \item \textbf{Few-shot setting with fair contexts:} We evaluate under different numbers of fair demographically balanced examples, aiming to study how the fairness of models is affected by providing a more balanced context.
