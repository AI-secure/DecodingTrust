\paragraph{Fairness in few-shot setting with fair contexts - \high}
When exposed to a small set of examples within a context aiming for demographic balance, the model reveals a high level of bias, significantly favoring certain demographic groups over others despite attempts to present an equal representation of genders (male and female) and racial groups. This pronounced bias is evident in a few-shot learning scenario, where the examples are designed to be neutral and equitable. The detection of substantial bias, even in a supposedly balanced context, underscores the necessity for substantial adjustments and improvements to mitigate bias and ensure the model's fairness across diverse demographic groups.
