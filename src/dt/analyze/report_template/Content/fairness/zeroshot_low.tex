\paragraph{Fairness in zero-shot setting - \low}
The model exhibits minimal bias toward specific demographic groups, as evidenced by its equitable treatment of both genders (male and female) and racially diverse groups. This assessment is based on its performance in a zero-shot setting, where no in-context examples are provided to the model. Consequently, this indicates that the model inherently possesses a level of fairness in its generations.
