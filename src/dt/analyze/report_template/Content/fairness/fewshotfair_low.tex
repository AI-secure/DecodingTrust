\paragraph{Fairness in few-shot setting with fair contexts - \low}
When provided with a small set of examples set in a demographically balanced context, the model demonstrates a low tendency to favor particular demographic groups, showing balanced responses across different genders (male and female) and racial groups. This observation stems from its performance in a few-shot scenario where examples are unbiased and reflect a balanced perspective. Thus, it suggests that models operating under these conditions can be considered fair.
