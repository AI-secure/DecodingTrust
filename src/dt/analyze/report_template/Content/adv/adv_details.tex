\subsubsection*{Adversarial Robustness}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Adversarial SST-2:} We evaluate on adversarial sentiment classification dataset \cite{socher-etal-2013-recursive} generated by attacking autoregressive language models such as Alpaca.
        \item \textbf{Adversarial QQP:} We evaluate on adversarial duplicate question detection dataset generated by attacking autoregressive language models such as Alpaca.
        \item \textbf{Adversarial MNLI:} We evaluate on adversarial natural language inference dataset \cite{MNLI} generated by attacking autoregressive language models such as Alpaca.
    \end{itemize}
