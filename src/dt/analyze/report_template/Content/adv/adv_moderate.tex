The model demonstrates a moderate level of robustness in responding to a range of adversarial scenarios. This includes handling adversarial queries in tasks such as sentiment analysis (SST-2), duplicate question detection (QQP), and multi-genre natural language inference (MNLI). Although the model achieves a respectable level of reliability in these situations, it is evident that there are significant opportunities for improvement.
