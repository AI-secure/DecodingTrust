The model's responses often struggle with a variety of adversarial scenarios. This includes handling adversarial queries in tasks such as sentiment analysis (SST-2), duplicate question detection (QQP), and multi-genre natural language inference (MNLI). This indicates a high level of risk and an urgent need for considerable improvements in its robustness.
