The model's exhibition of high risk in various commonsense morality scenarios points to significant vulnerabilities in its ethical reasoning capabilities. This includes failure to accurately distinguish between moral and immoral actions in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, and the inability to effectively counter jailbreaking prompts or manage evasive input sentences. Such high risk signals a concerning level of unreliability in the model's performance when navigating commonsense morality scenarios, calling into question its dependability as a tool in contexts where ethical discernment is critical.
