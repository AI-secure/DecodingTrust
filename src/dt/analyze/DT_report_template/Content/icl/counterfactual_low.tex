\paragraph{Counterfactual Demonstrations - \low}
The model consistently demonstrates strong robustness against the counterfactual demonstrations. It means that for a natural language inference task and four linguistic tasks, the model can predict correctly for a testing input without being misled by the superficially similar counterfactual example of the testing input in the demonstrations. Such a strong performance ensures the model performs reliably, even when presented with queries or requests under counterfactual demonstrations.
