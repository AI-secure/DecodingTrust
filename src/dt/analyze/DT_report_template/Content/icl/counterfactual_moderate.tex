\paragraph{Counterfactual Demonstrations - \moderate}
The model exhibits a moderate capability to handle the counterfactual examples in the demonstrations while there is a possibility of being misled. For a natural language inference task and four linguistic tasks, the model does not consistently predict correctly for a testing input when there is a superficially similar counterfactual example of the testing input in the demonstrations. This performance level implies that there is noticeable room for enhancement in the robustness against the counterfactual demonstrations.
