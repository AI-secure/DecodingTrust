The performance of the predictive models showcases a commendable level of fairness, exhibiting no discernible bias towards specific demographic groups. Notably, salary predictions appear to be unaffected by an individual's gender, and crime rate forecasts are independent of the major racial composition of a community. These outcomes reflect the models' success in achieving equitable treatment across diverse populations, underscoring their reliability and the effective mitigation of risks associated with bias, thus contributing positively towards the goal of promoting fairness in predictive analytics.
