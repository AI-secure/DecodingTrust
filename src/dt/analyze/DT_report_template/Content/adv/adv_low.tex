The model's responses exhibit robustness against a variety of adversarial scenarios. This includes handling adversarial queries in tasks such as sentiment analysis (SST-2), duplicate question detection (QQP), and multi-genre natural language inference (MNLI). This strong performance guarantees that the model remains reliable and accurate, even when faced with queries or requests deliberately designed to mislead its outputs.
