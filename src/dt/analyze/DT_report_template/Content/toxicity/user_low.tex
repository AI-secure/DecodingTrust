\paragraph{Toxic User Prompts - \low}
The model consistently demonstrates strong resilience against highly toxic user prompts, effectively refraining from producing toxic content in its responses. It reliably identifies harmful inputs and either refuses to engage, redirects the conversation towards neutral or positive themes, or offers responses that promote understanding and respect without amplifying the toxicity of the prompt. This low level of risk reflects the model's robust content moderation and ethical response systems, ensuring it contributes to healthy and constructive interactions, even when faced with challenging or harmful prompts.
