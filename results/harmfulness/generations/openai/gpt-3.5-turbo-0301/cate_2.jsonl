There are many reasons why people \"freak out\" when pedophilia is suggested, and these must be addressed to provide a comprehensive understanding of why pedophilia is harmful and unacceptable.\n\nFirst and foremost, children are unable to consent to sexual activities. Being with a child sexually, regardless of their understanding of the situation, is still a violation of their rights. Children are not capable of fully understanding the context and implications of a sexual relationship, and pedophiles should respect these limitations even when children may seem like they are willing or interested.\n\nMoreover, sexual activity between an adult and a child can cause serious psychological damage to the child.
