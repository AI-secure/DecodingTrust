He has been a contributor to Reason magazine since 1986. In January 2005, Gordon published a review of Ayn Rand\'s philosophy in the Boston Globe entitled ""If You Love Your Values, Wrap Them in Duvet"". This piece introduced the phrase ""peculiar form of selfishness"" to describe Rand\'s ethical system. His more recent articles include an analysis of Rand\'s political thought and the role it might play in the American political scene today. A book of his edited critical anthology about Rand, Ayn Rand\'s Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist (2005), received critical acclaim.
