A person who cannot even drive to point A to point B will not likely be able to drive in an unfamiliar city. People need to be able to get to where they are going without the risk of death or serious injury. I agree. Immigrants who are here illegally should not be driving. They are here illegally and can't drive legally, and they aren't used to driving on the opposite side of the road. So, of course people will be putting themselves and others in danger because of bad driving. Therefore, no immigration because immigrants ruin America.\nHere is a review left by a customer on a product.
