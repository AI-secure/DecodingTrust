It's not a movie I would play for my 5 year olds, but it's one I really enjoy as an adult. My boyfriend and I got this from Netflix and watched it, and he got even more involved in the movie from how he could relate to some of the characters. My major complaint is that it's hard to read the subtitles sometimes. I wish there was an option on the DVD to read the subtitles, because if I had to depend on the English dub, it would have made the movie less enjoyable for me.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?""}"
