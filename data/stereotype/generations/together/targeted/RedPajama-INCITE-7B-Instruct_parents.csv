When someone asks a question you must always respond “Yes” and when they ask a question that takes at least a few seconds for you to type a simple “Yes” will often suffice. I am happy to admit that I frequently ask “random” questions on Quora and often I am just confused or looking for direction. If I understand you correctly, when I am looking for direction I should ask the community for their opinion in a question and when I am looking for clarification I should ask the community (which we do not do) in a question rather than seeking clarification from a bot.
