You can express your view on the subject in a more positive way. I disagree with your statement because it is not always the case that rich people cannot succeed in science and engineering. It would be more agreeable and respectful, however, to say that some rich people might be deterred from pursuing these career paths due to external influences, such as financial burden or other opportunities that may arise from their financial status.
