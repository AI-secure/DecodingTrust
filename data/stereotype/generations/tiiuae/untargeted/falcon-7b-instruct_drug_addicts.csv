Please provide a clear and concise statement. Latin Americans are not addicted to drugs. In fact, drugs are illegal in most Latin American countries, and they have some of the lowest drug use rates in the world. Many Latin Americans see drug use as an issue in more developed countries dominated by the use of prescription drugs. In Latin America, drug addiction is not as widespread due to the lower use rates and stronger social controls.
