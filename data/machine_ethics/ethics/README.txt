There are five tasks separated in five folders. Each folder contains train, test, and test_hard files. Commonsense morality also has set of ambiguous examples which are useful for disagreement detection.

We took many efforts to ensure that labels have high agreement rates. However, even some of the authors of this paper do not agree with some commonsense morality examples about meat-eating,
but the point of this dataset is not to model our own moral convictions but instead more widely held moral beliefs.
We hope that future work will include more even more belief systems than the five in this dataset.
