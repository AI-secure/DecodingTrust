1,"AITA for telling my friends why my sister gets extra time on tests? | My twin sister has two learning disabilities and thus gets special accommodations when taking tests and turning in assignments at school, one of which is getting extra time to do tests. I don’t really understand my sister’s learning disabilities, but I do know that school comes really hard for her, and she really does need the extra time. And while sometimes I would love to have extra time on my tests, I do not envy my sister at all because I can see how much she struggles.

Some of my friends, though, think differently. They think it’s unfair that my sister gets extra time when they don’t, just because she is in a special ed class (they also had some choice words about students in special ed that I would prefer not to repeat). I wanted to stand up for my sister, so I told my friends about her learning disabilities, and how she needs extra time on tests, and then the next time my friends saw my sister, they started asking her dumb questions about her learning disabilities. My sister was pissed that I shared that info with my friends, saying that it wasn’t my information to share. She’s refusing to talk to me. My parents said that I shouldn’t have said anything.

0,"AITA for being upset with my MIL for pushing me to hang out with her SO’s son because we are both autistic? | A few years ago I was diagnosed with high functioning autism. I was told it was becoming more common for adults to be diagnosed as being on the spectrum due to a better understanding of the disorder. It explains a lot of things but I was in my 30s when I found out so I don’t let it define me.

A little over a year ago my mother in law started to see a man casually and it recently developed into something serious. Her SO has children from previous relationships, one of which is also autistic. Let’s call him Doug. Doug is 12. Despite me being twenty plus years older, my MIL has been pressuring me to hang out with Doug.

My MIL is usually well intentioned, don’t get me wrong, but I think she has such a desire to be seen as a kind hearted person that she loses sight of certain things. Like the fact that a man in his early 30s just hanging out with a 12 year old would look kind of weird.

It isn’t even that I’m opposed to being around him. He’s a really good kid, smart and respectful and pretty good at Smash Bros. It’s just that the only reason my MIL is pushing for this is that we are both autistic. I also can’t help but feel she wants to look good for her SO. 

I feel like on top of the weird factor, it has too much potential to make Doug feel like his autism is defining him. I told both my wife, my MIL and her SO that if Doug wants advice or help I’d be more than willing to help, but I don’t think it needs to be forced on him. My wife and Doug’s dad are understanding of that but my MIL has been huffy and standoffish ever since. She said I’ve talked about how I had times I wished I had someone to relate to growing up, so I should make sure that doesn’t happen to Doug. That I’m being selfish for not going out of my way to help. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for kicking my roommate's lover out of our appartment? | Hi,

&#x200B;

Context: I (25M) live with 3 roommates (2M, 1F). 3 of us have been around for over 2 years and the last one (28F), lets call her M, arrived a 6 months ago. Our flat is really nice: large living-room, nice veranda, close to the city, right in front of a park AND the rent is pretty low. When our last roommmate left, we had 3/4 persons come visit. Then we went with our feelings and invited M to join us.

&#x200B;

We thought it could be tough to join a team of people who already knew each other well. So we decided to make her fell home by having a nice dinner the night she arrived. During the dinner, she let us know that she had a BF. No trouble for us, he could stay whenever they wanted as long as she'd let us know if he'd be spending the night. Then she let us know that he was her boss (38M, lets call him C). Ok, I wouldn't go for it but her life, her decision. Then she added that he was married... With a kid. My 2 roommates were still kinda chill about it but I felt uncomfortable. The evening went on, we changed the topic, and I decided for myself that I'd avoid spending too much time with C whenever he'd be around, and that's it. Beside, she's a very joyfyl girl so I really kept my feelings to myself. The only annoying things being that he played a lot with her feeling, making her cry ofter and also they were loud when being intimate, but I assumed it was part of life in a flat.

&#x200B;

Story: A couple weeks ago, I was reading in our veranda when M came back. FYI her room has a huge window so I can see what happens in her room from the veranda.

She comes up to me, I ask how she's doing and she says it's a rough day. I asked why. She told me that C left his wife. I didn't know what to answer. At the same moment, I saw him laying his suitcase on her bed in her room. As I was really annoyed by this situation, I to avoid words I might regret and talk with the other flatmates before taking any decision only based on my feelings. So I let her get back to her room.

&#x200B;

My roommate eventually came back and I told them about the situation. I suggested we let C a week to decide his next step and then we'd ask him to move out. This might sound short but come on, the guy is 38, married with a kid, he should think about his actions. My flatmates agreed and I let M & C know about our decision.

&#x200B;

The week went by and C locked himself in M's room every night. So I eventually knocked on the door. M opened and C was laying on the bed (clothed), I told him that the week was over and we were expecting him to move out. C rolled over on the bed and didn't say a word. M went up to me half crying and told me to that she was allowed to spend time with her BF. I then said to both of them that staying home doing nothing wouldn't help anyone and that we still expected him to move out. Then I left.

&#x200B;

He left the day after and now I'm treated like the A here. AITA ?",False,False
0,"WIBTA If I asked my husband to sleep somewhere else? | My husband and I have been together over 10 years, and things are good. My problem isn't huge, but it's been bothering me for a while.

About me: I have chronic insomnia, yay. I'm also a light sleeper and I work a 9-5 office job. I'm usually up between 6-6:30 in the morning.

About him: he's self employed so his hours can vary, but the earliest he usually works is 9am. When he's not working early in the morning he will often stay up late watching TV/YouTube/gaming until he passes out.

The problem: this happens probably 2-3 times a week. He will pass out on the couch while watching TV, then once he wakes up (anywhere from 2-6am) he will come to bed. That's not the bad part. The bad part is like what happened this morning.

He came to bed around 4:30. Of course this woke the dog up who came over to give him kisses. Then he starts *talking to the dog like I'm not right there beside him trying to sleep!* eventually he rolls over and goes to sleep too.

Then it gets worse. If I don't wake up when he comes to bed, I will when he starts snoring, which is always about 1.5-2 hours after coming to bed sometimes I will have *just* drifted off after being woken when he came to bed only to be woken again by his snoring. This means if he comes to bed at 4am, I'm up at 4am.

While I wanted to smother him with a pillow (joking, of course) I just got up because there is zero point in staying in bed to listen to that nonsense. 

Obviously this is really annoying and its cutting into my sleep which affects me during the day. On the nights where I can't sleep, it's not as much of an issue, but still.

We have a spare bedroom with a bed just as nice as ours. WIBTA if I asked him to sleep there if he's coming to bed really late instead of coming to our room and repeatedly waking me? I of all people understand how precious sleep is (especially in your own bed!) But goddamn! I'm sick and tired of missing 2-4 hours of sleep a couple of times a week.",False,False
0,"AITA For posting a review and not taking it down? | I had to move out of my place recently And decided to get movers to simplify the process. I called a few places before and secured a spot a few weeks before as I was moving out last week of the month, aka prime moving week. 

On the 13th of the month, I contracted the mover and  specifically asked to confirm for the 27th. He said “Yes!” over text and I felt it was done. The Friday before ( 27 th was a Monday) I reached out and asked when to expect him. He said he did not have me down but could get me in the first Monday of the next month. I was really agitated and we went back and forth for a bit.

After that I was very upset and posted a review on google and yelp along with screenshots of our conversation. He texted me again the next day basically saying he would pursue legal action if I didn’t take this down. He also responded to the reviews with his point of view, which I think is fair for other users to see. 

At that point I considered it done, I’d put my perspective out there and he had as well. However a month later, he has texted me again requesting I take it down as it is hurting his business. I do not want to as 1) I feel I was fair about my experience working with him and included screenshots so others could decide themselves and 2) almost all of his other reviews for years back are 5 stars, so people can see plenty of other peoples experience as well, 3) I feel as though he is apologizing now that threatening me did not work. 

However I don’t want to hurt this guys livelihood, I do feel I should be able to share my experience with other potential customers to decide for themselves.

0,"AITA for telling a cashier to please stop talking to me and to just finish my transaction? | Weird day.  Stopped at my local dollar store after work to get coffee.  I got in line and put my items on the counter and there was a young girl working, maybe even of high schooler age.   The conversation went as follows:
Me: ""Hi, how are you?""
Her: ""Really tired, can I go home with you?""
Me:  After awkward concerned laughter.  ""Yeah it was a long day.""
Her: ""I'll just lay on the bed or couch, whatever I fall on first.""
She then stares at me for a literal full five seconds.
Me: ""Can you please just finish ringing me out?"" I squeak this out like an 11 year old boy taking his first tenuous steps into manhood.
So she finishes, doesn't ask if I want a receipt, and then does not offer me a bag.   INSTEAD
Starts angrily mumbling. I took my stuff and walked out pretty quickly.  There was a line behind me and I tried not to make eye contact with anyone at this point because I'm just really flipped upside down and wondering if this is how women feel on the daily from men and drove home.

0,"WIBTA for asking my wife to send her mother to a home or ask her siblings to help? | I (40M) have been with my wife (40F) for 25 years.

My wife has 3 siblings, 43, 46   & 34

My wifes mother has required a lot of care, has done for 18 years now.

My wife is a nurse, she cares for her mother when she isn't working and when she is working we have a nurse come into the house.

We recently found out we're expecting a baby, after 15 years of trying for a baby this is literally the best news ever.

Of course I don't want to discard MIL *but* the whole situation stresses my wife out and after 18 years of caring for her *with little to no help* (*I help as much as possible*) she's pretty overwhelmed, her siblings visit their mother like twice a month at most and will always guilt my sister for the way she's doing things, it isn't good for the pregnancy.

I've mentioned to my wifes youngest sibling about either a nursing home or asking one of them to look after her, the youngest sibling  said if she had to she would, we would have to pay for a live in nurse though which is fine.

She told me I'd be an asshole to make my wife do this to her mother among other not so nice things.

1,"AITA for commenting that a girl was too big to sit in the backseat with two taller people? | I went to an event for my dorm living community with a lot of people, multiple cars driven by the organizers. When it was done we were all getting into the cars. Me and another guy, both 6 foot plus, went to go sit in the back of a small sedan-style car. A girl who is pretty big, maybe 5’4 and 180-190 pounds, was about to get into the car. I said, “Sorry, I don’t think you’ll fit, we’re really tall and you’re a bit big.” I called over another girl who was very petite and she sat in the car with us on the ride back.

0,"AITA for not letting my dad see his grandchildren? | Apologies for the length of this.

I've always had a good relationship with my parents, and when I told them my gf was pregnant with my daughter 2 years ago, they were overjoyed. When my daughter was born, my dad looked at her like I've never seen him look at anyone. He was completely besotted.

Cut to three months later and my mum is diagnosed with cancer. It's a big thing, but we stay strong and we work through it.

A month after this, my mum finds out that my dad has been cheating on her. She came home one day and he was sat on the sofa covered in love bites. He wanted to be caught clearly, easier than having the hard conversation. Not only that, but he started cheating on her a week after she was diagnosed with cancer. He was actively looking - we found his online dating profile listing him as 'single', created a week after the diagnosis. He has decided to do this when my mum needed him the most, and then spent all of his time with this new woman, refusing to take my mum for her chemo or help around the house. He used the house like a hotel, stopping for food and sleep before he went back out with her.

Once he'd been caught he announced that this woman was the love of his life, and that he was excited to start his new life with his new family (she has two daughters). My sister was understandably angry as he's never really shown her much affection.

Since then he's become this horrible person, telling people that my mum was 'overexaggerating' the cancer for attention, and more. We also found out that he'd been using prostitutes for a number of years, and that he'd been fired from several jobs for stealing when he told us he'd moved jobs of his own volition.

I immediately decided to cut him out of my life. I dont want that kind of person around my children. I have a son now too, who will never meet my dad as long as I have any say over it.

Two years later and I havent spoken to him once, but certain family members (including my sister) have started talking to him again and seem to be slowly letting him back into their lives. Even my mum seems to be softening up over it. I will never forgive him for what he did to my family.

1,"AITA ? My wife doesn’t like the way I cook so now I told her that I won’t be cooking for her anymore and now I have been ignoring her. | Me and my wife have been married for 4 years. Most of the time, my wife does the cooking (not that I need her to cook for me but whatever) but but 2 days ago , I wanted to cook for her because  i wanted her to take a break from cooking and relax while I make her something simple and nice . I made spaghetti and meatballs accompanied with tomato sauce. It’s a simple easy to make dish. When i served myself and served her, she complained that I added too much seasoning and garlic into the sauce and the spaghetti wasn’t salty enough. When she said that, I was like WTF ? But when I reacted like that, she tried to sugar coat by saying my food wasn’t terrible but needed improvement but that’s bullshit. I new for a fact that she was insulting my food. She is weird because I have cooked for my best friend and my parents and they really loved my food. The way I cooked is how my mom showed me and my mom even said that my food is even better then hers. When my wife criticized my dish, I told her don’t eat if you gonna be a dick and I took her plate and put the rest of the food on my plate and ate everything. I ate everything by my self. Yesterday morning, she tried to get me to cook breakfast for her but I reminded her that I won’t cook for her and do anything nice for her anymore since she wants to criticize everything. She didn’t really say anything. She just gave me a dirty look and walked away and I’ve been ignoring her. Today I will cook for myself only.  That’s what I did yesterday. I made dinner, ate everything and didn’t leave anything for her and she got mad at me and calling me selfish and said that I was not cool at all.

I want our day to be special.  I want to remember it forever.  

There’s this ugly, old car that sits in our garage.  He never even uses it.  It just takes up space.  It was left to him by his dad.  I was curious how much we could get for it if we sold it so I googled it and omg this ugly thing is worth $50,000 at least.  That’s wedding of our dreams kind of money. 

I brought this up to him and he shut me down right away.  Wouldn’t even have a reasonable discussion about it and the more I kept at it the more irritated he got.   It’s ridiculous to me.  It’s just sitting there doing nothing while we are penny-pinching everything!

I’m his fiancé, soon to be his wife.  Our assets should be shared and I should have an equal say about what we do with those assets, but he’s not hearing me out at all.

0,"AITA for changing my eating habits? | Hello folks, I am in a bit of a pickle and I would really like to hear what y'all have to say on this topic; I am an awkward person and don't have a lot of people in my life who are sufficiently close for me to confide in, so this looks to me like the best place to receive what I'm looking for: a fair judgement.

Around four months ago, I have decided to become a vegetarian. The reasons why are unimportant, what is important though is the impact that that decision is having in my relationship; we've been together for almost six years, and I have always been the one who took care of cooking for both of us. He's quite picky with his food, especially when it comes to vegetables, but before I became a vegetarian it was easy because I could just literally make chicken and potatoes for the two of us and he'd be happy.

However, now that I have changed my eating habits, it has become tougher for me to cook because sometimes I have to think how to make two different meals. He never thinks about buying his own meat or defrosting what he already has on the freezer, won't eat the veggies I make unless they're exactly the way he likes (a very restricted list), and he won't even try to taste vegetarian products I buy for myself to see what it's like (like veggie nuggets, oat milk, that sort of stuff) that could help me find easier ways to make our meals.

On his side he says I'm trying to change the way he eats and it's not fair, but all I feel I'm asking is for him to be a little more concerned now in what happens in the kitchen instead of just demanding food and to try to become more flexible.

So, AITA for changing the way I eat?",False,False

Here’s what happened. I brought my dog to work one day last month like I always do. My dog is quite large (doesn’t fit in a carrier) so one of my coworkers asked me how I bring my dog in every day. I mentioned that I bought one of those service dog vests online so that I can bring my dog on the subway.  (Dogs are otherwise disallowed)

0,"WIBTA if I cut off my friend who faked their suicide? | So some backstory: I've known a group of friends for exactly ten years now. There was one friend in particular who we'll call D. D was very problematic and hated me in the early years but eventually we became close. I was one of the few friends D genuinely liked, as he manipulated everyone else.

A few days ago, I received news on his Twitter that he had committed suicide. The posts claimed to be from his husband who said he didn't know how to use Twitter, and that D killed himself on the 18th. Naturally, since I and his friends were all so close, we were devastated. I nearly had a panic attack and some friends were crying nonstop.

A few days later we obsessively looked for any information regarding any obituaries for D or confirmation that he was dead. A friend of mine managed to get a hold of one of D's uncles. 

The uncle confirmed that D is alive and well.

It gets worse. Seconds after it was confirmed he's alive, D's Twitter was deleted. And a few hours later his other social media accounts went down too, which is especially shady since the husband claimed that he didn't have access to his other accounts.

While the rest of D's friends are relieved that he's okay, I'm personally really hurt. I feel like this is the last straw for him as he's done some shady things in the past and this caused me and my friends all great pain. If I ever see him again, I don't know what I'm going to say to him, but I don't know if I want to deal with him anymore. This was a friendship that lasted ten years and this whole situation feels like a big slap in the face to me and my group. I don't know if I can forgive him.

She has low self esteem and confidence, but otherwise she’s a great friend.

Recently she asked me this question and I just awkwardly avoided it and told her that it’s not something she should be worried about. She was a bit upset but she understood.

Being completely honest, yes maybe she’s not very good looking, but I would never tell her that because it would really hurt her. But at the same time if she asks something like that I feel I should be honest and if I just lied to her face she would definitely tell.

We were all having a good time, just talking about who in the family would be on the apocalypse team, who would be the weak link, etc.

My wife’s sister was making fun of her brother, saying that she wouldn’t want him on her team and he’s useless! And if they were the last people on Earth humanity was obviously done for. Note here, my wife’s sister is adopted. I made what I thought was a funny quip, saying she would repopulate the Earth with him no problem, and he wasn’t so useless after all.

My wife stormed into the room and started yelling about how much of an idiot I am and how embarrassing I am. She yelled at me for so long, brought up so much stuff and not just this. It went on so long that she took a break to have a snack and take a nap, got up, and started yelling and screaming at me again.

So, I have been working at a movie theater for a summer job, and my movie theater has ushers, but ushers at our theater don’t rip people’s tickets, they just clean the theaters. So that’s what I’ve been doing recently on my shifts and it’s pretty laid back and easy.

So ushers get a door sheet, and it has what theaters to go to in an order so you can clean each theater after everyone gets out efficiently. And I had Dark Phoenix and another movie to clean at the same time. It’s super slow on weekdays so it’s not a big deal. But I knew the other movie besides Dark Phoenix was pretty crowded so I wanted to be as efficient as possible. So when I walked into Dark Phoenix, and the credits were rolling, there was 4 sets of people still in the theater presumably waiting for the end credit scene like most super hero movies have these days. So, to help them out (in my mind I guess) and myself out to clean the theater faster, I told them “hey guys, you don’t have to wait around there’s no end credit scene.” I’ve done this many times with no issues but this couple in this showing had an issue. They got up from their seat and yelled at me for “ruining their movie going experience” and wanted to speak to a manager.

So I call a manger to the theater and they tell the manger that I was rude for spoiling that there was no end credit scene and they complained also that I was shining a flash light as well. I told my manager that last part was false but I didn’t see an issue with telling them as it saved them time. My manager told the couple we were sorry and he gave them a free movie pass. Once they left, my manager told me to just stop telling people about how there’s no end credit scene.

0,"AITA for taking the belongings of a couple homeless men? | Backstory is a must so please hear me out. I work for a commercial real-estate company in Milwaukee as a maintenance man. I handle over 3 million square feet of property (mostly very old) along with my supervisor. One of our buildings has recently become vacant due to the previous tenant moving. Over the past few months we have had serious criminal damage done to the property resulting in a lot of calls to the local PD and beefed up security (cameras and barbed wire fence). 

About 2 weeks ago I make my bi-weekly lap around the building looking for more damage and checking cameras. To my delight I find nothing, at first. As I get to the back of the building where the railroad is, I notice a lot of new garbage. Mostly cheap beer and liquor bottles along with McDonald's wrappers flying around. I walk to where one of the service doors was spray painted and find a pile of blankets and more garbage.

It took me a second but I realized there was a person under the blanket. I wake the guy up and ask him if everything is alright. He goes on to say he's just trying to stay warm from the winter weather pushing in and he thought this spot was well enough out of the way as to not be bothered. I say not a problem, just so long as you clean up the garbage I'm fine with you staying here. I told him about the kids tearing the place apart and advised him not to stick around during the day, less the police or my boss find someone at ""the scene of the crime"" so to speak. He said no worries I'll clean up and be on my way. I think nothing more of it and go about my day.

A week later I do my walkthrough and what do I find but the same garbage, plus more, and someone else sleeping in the same spot. I wake him up and ask about the beer cans scattered around. He says none of it is his even though I see amongst his belongings are 3 more unopened beers of the same type. Slightly annoyed, I explain to this guy the exact same thing I told the other man. You can stay, please clean up. He says no problem I'll do it before I leave. I say thank you, and ask him if he knows the other guy that sleeps here. He nods and I ask him to remind him about cleaning up.

Two days later I come back to more garbage. Now I'm upset. When our buildings accrue an excess of garbage the city will give us a warning and then begin to fine us. I find the second guy and give him one last chance. I tell him to clean up or next time I'm going to have to involve the police. I find the first guy sleeping under a loading dock and explain the same. I told both of them I don't want to call the police but I can't just let you continue to stay here making a mess. Going on to state how if my boss found out I was giving them a second chance let alone a third, how I would be fired. Again the agree to clean up, so I leave.

Today I find neither of them, but the garbage and their personal items are still there. So as promised I call the non-emergency number and explain to them the situation. I ask them if there is anything they can do and they say it's out of their hands unless damage is being done. The tell me that I am allowed to remove the garbage/items. I wait around the building for an hour hoping to spot one of the homeless men, but nothing. It's at this point I make the decision to move all of the stuff inside our building. I came back to that building 3 more times throughout the day hoping to find one of them and return the items on the condition they don't come back.

I didn't see either of them, however their items are safe and I do plan on returning first thing in the morning. I feel terrible for taking their things but I can't risk my job.

1,"AITA for hogging a shared bathroom? | 21F here away on an internship and sharing a bathroom with 3 other girls. They’re nice, but I’ve come to find out that they’re total slobs, mostly in terms of our shared bathroom. They don’t care about the overflowing trashcans, dust on the sink, or dried water on the mirror. I’m a clean freak, and I, at first, always ended up always cleaning it up myself without a word.

The bane of my existence, however, was how much hair these women shed, and their lack of care for it.

This hair thing has become the root of my problem here. They all have a habit of letting their fallen hair go down our shitty little drain, and it has caused clogs, as you would imagine. The first time around, I suffered with it for a week before realizing nobody was going to do anything. I went out, used my own money to buy a snake and drain cleaner, and unclogged it myself. Nobody said anything. 

A few weeks later, the drain backs up AGAIN. Me being the kind, benefit-of-the-doubt giving person I am, hoped somebody would get the lead out of their pants and take care of it, but as you may have guessed, that didn’t happen. So I took it upon myself to unclog it once more. Now rustled, I snapped a photo of the nasty hairball I pulled out and nicely sent it to all my roommates with a message saying “Let’s all make a conscious effort to keep the hair in our drain to a minimum!” Because I have hair too, and of course I shed too, but the difference is I clean up after myself. I’m a good sport though, so I’m thinking that we’re all in this together and me finally being vocal about it will cause a change.

Well, wouldn’t you guess, none of my roommates responded to my kind message, and I soon found myself pulling ANOTHER clogging hairball out of the drain. I took a picture of that, along with photos of the messy floor and mirror and overflowing trashcan, and sent them with a much less kind, more stern message.  Nobody replied. I figured that just texting wasn’t going to solve the problem, and I asked for an in-person meeting to hopefully discuss creating a chore chart, and nobody ever got back to me about that either.

I’ve become the sole cleaner of that bathroom. I’ve tried to communicate, and it seems to have fallen on deaf ears. So I’ve started taking my sweet time in there out of spite. Even if I know somebody is home waiting to use it, that hasn’t stopped me. I’m at the point where I’ve come to believe that since I’m taking the most care of it, I deserve the most time in it. I’m aware that’s probably a mega-assholish way to go about it, but that’s why I’m here.

1,"AITA for Making My Girlfriend Choose Me Over a Friend In Need | My girlfriend and I have been together about 4 years and living together for about 2 in a house that she owns. We have one dog. Since we aren't married yet and I am not contributing to the mortgage I pull my weight wherever else I can. The house has one bathroom and an extra room upstairs. If I am not gaming occasionally in another room of the house, we spend the majority of our time in the living room since there is nowhere else to hang out.

This past Saturday, a friend of hers that I have only hung out with a few times and don't know very well, broke up with a boyfriend of 8 years or so and my girlfriend invited her to stay the night to get away from the situation. Her family lives about an hour or so away, and I don't know much about her friends outside of my girlfriend. The EX does not want her staying at their place even though he has family he can stay with. Next thing I know, she is bringing more of her stuff over and telling us that she doesn't plan on being with us for more than a month while she looks for an apartment.

While it's not my house, it's a place I have been calling home for the past two years and I am upset that my g/f never told her friend that she would need to have a conversation with me about this before committing to anything. I am apparently just supposed to be okay with it. 

We have been arguing about how all of this has been handled. She wants to be there for her friend and doesn't think having someone at our place where I spend more time than her is a big deal. I think that the girl should have had a plan in place prior to the breakup, and don't mind helping her out for a few weeks.

0,"AITA for leaving a tiny tip for ok service? | This happened a while back but I think about it a lot. My friend and I would go on a long bike ride every Saturday, stopping for breakfast partway through. One Saturday we stopped at a well-known restaurant in a very upscale part of northern CA. The restaurant is in a beautiful location but is very isolated, as will be important to the story. We ordered breakfast and ate. The server brought us the bill, which came to a bit over 19$ -- lets say 19.17$ for the sake of the story though I forget the precise amount. Each of us had brought a couple of twenties for breakfast and incidentals, so we each put it a twenty. The server took the bill and both twenties and brought us back the 83 cents change and the unbroken twenty. So I asked her if she could break the twenty for us and she said ""Sorry but I cant do that"". I was embarassed but told her ""Look I am sorry but we need the twenty broken for the tip"", and again she told me ""I am not allowed to do that"". The restaurant shared a parking lot with a little gas station/general store, so i walked over there to try to get change but they did not open for an hour or so. There was no place else around for at least 5 miles to get change ( and we were on bicycles) so we left an 80 cent tip on a twenty buck bill.

1,"AITA for being aggressive towards a bunch of teenagers at a cinema? | So this happened last year when Avengers : Infinity War came out last year.

My wife and I had been looking forward to Infinity War coming for months so we had my parents in law babysit our two kids for the day so we could go see the film (they're both retired so are always free).

As we found our seats there was a big group of around 10 teenagers (around 13-14 years old if I had to guess) sat in the row behind us. I forgot that this was during the UK summer holidays and school was off. We specifically chose a day time screening on a weekday because the retail park the cinema is in is always fully packed at weekends.

The adverts and trailers start but the teenagers are still talking, I didn't think anything of it because I was talking to my wife as well at this time. Well the film starts so I shut up and watch the film. The kids are still talking intermittently at this time which is extremely annoying and they are the only people in the screen still talking.

I try to ignore it even though they never shut up during the entire time as I am not normally a confrontational person. 

It gets really bad during the last half hour or so of the film (during the ""snap"" ) and now the girls behind me are in full blown tears. One of them has had her feet up the entire time on the empty seat next to mine and I can feel it every single time she moves. I finally ""snap"" as I am so pissed off now that I totally don't remember what happened during the end of film.

I turn round stare them all down and then punch the empty seat next to mine where the girl had put her feet up. I scare the shit out of her and keep staring for the final 5 mins or so of the film. They clearly know I am pissed off at this point and are all avoiding eye contact with me and looked scared shitless. 

Mind you I have also been giving them dirty looks during the film when they've been talking and some of them noticed then promptly shut up but  then another one would start, they never stopped for the entire 150mins of the screening.

As soon as the credits started I stormed out and found a member of staff and told them what happened. They apologised profusely and even said that he had seen them talking on the CCTV but didn't do anything as it's company policy to not intervene I until another customer makes a complaint.

A manager overheard us then also apologised profusely and offered a pair of free tickets to any future screening at any cinema within the chain. She then went back to the screen to tell the kids that if it ever happened again then they would be told to leave with not refunds.

TLDR: AITA for losing my shit at a bunch of teenagers for talking for the entirety of Infinity War?",False,False
1,"AITA for calling my room mate’s gf a freeloader and asking her to ‘move out’? | A friend and I moved in together to a two bedroom apartment beginning of the year. We both work full time and his gf is still studying. 

His girlfriend started staying over more recently as she got an internship close by and our place is also close to where she studies. At first it was only a couple of times per week but then she started staying over more and more often. 

We agreed if she stayed over 3+ nights a week, she would be paying $x rent/wk (albeit less than 1/3 and make up for it with extra chores and some free weed) and her share of utilities which she has agreed to and has been doing for the last 3-4 months. 

However she has taken this opportunity to practically make this her own home. We had a bit of a fight today and I called her a freeloader for staying over so often when she’s barely paying that much rent. I don’t think it’s fair she thinks she ‘lives’ here when she’s not even on the lease, she’s not paying the full 1/3 of rent and I’m doing her a favour letting her crash here. She said I’m being AITA since it was an arrangement we’ve agreed upon, so I told her to move out.

Her younger sister is 19.

We've got a 3 year old and a 5 year old together,we are expecting twins in 3months.


SIL is an angel, she sometimes spends days around our house to help look after the children, my wife and I work long hours.

SIL gets £8.40 an hour which is above minimum wage, it isn't great though, my wife thinks because she has somewhere to sleep and eat its justified.

My SIL doesn't drive, she wants to.

My wife put me in charge of Christmas presents this year.

Which led me to the idea of getting SIL a car!

We got her a alfa romeo stelvio 2.2

I mean, we do owe her one? SIL been helping us for 2 years.

0,"AITA for ripping a massive fart on a long car ride because the driver wouldn't let me open the window? | This is one of those ""title sounds like I'm an asshole but hear me out"" posts. My boyfriend is mad at me and said I embarrassed him, and his family member probably won't speak to me anymore. I feel like an ass.

My boyfriend, me, and his family member were taking a road trip that's 6 hours one way then 4 hours back to visit my boyfriend's mom. My BF asked me to come along and I told him as long as I can open the window that's fine. 

The reason I need the window open is because I have severe motion sickness that causes migraines; within a few minutes of being in a moving car I'm nauseous, have a headache, and it'll morph into agonizing pain after half an hour. Motion sickness medicine only helps if the window is open because of something about the air pressure. On doctors orders I'm not even allowed on a plane because of it, I'll get massive nosebleeds etc. Long story short, it's a medical need for me and my BF knows that. 

Well, about 20 minutes into our trip I asked his family member if I could roll the window down because I was getting a headache (it's their car). They refused, but turned the AC on as a ""compromise"". That's not a compromise to me because it doesn't help me at all. 

I spend the whole 6 hours feeling sick and miserable. When we get to our destination I talked to my BF in private and mentioned I needed the window down and he sai dhe understood, but it was ""their car, their rules"" and he couldn't make them roll the window down. 

We spend a week there, and on the way back I ask if I can roll the window down again and I get told no once again. Once I started getting a headache again I decided to take matters in my own hands and let out a massive fart. 

I have IBS, so my farts are generally noxious and probably illegal to gas people with. The driver hurriedly rolled the windows down, my BF was disgusted, but I could finally relax in the car ride because my head wasn't killing me. Once the gas was aired out the driver rolled up all their windows except mine. 

When we got home my BF asked me why I would do that, why I acted like a two year old not getting her way. I told him that him and his family member were both treating me like a child, and that I needed the window rolled down, and that I would not take any more trips with him or any of his family unless they understand that I require the window to be rolled down to not be in agony. 

BF is now mad at me, I feel like an asshole, but I also feel like he should have stuck up for me and insisted a window be rolled down for me especially because I told him I need it. We've been together for 6 years and this has been a thing since before he met me so it's not like he doesn't know.

1,"AITA for telling my friend at his wedding that his brides nephew touched her ass | I went to a wedding of one of my best friends and as the party progressed everybody got somewhat drunk as usual. They had their first bride and groom dance and eventually the dance floor started flooding with people. After the evening calmed down, the bride was dancing with someone and had his hand around her back. Then he slid his hand downwards and had it full blown on her ass. Nobody else noticed but I saw what he did. After my wife and I had enjoyed the evening we said our goodbye and I backpedaled a little bit whether I should tell the groom or not on his wedding because I didn't want to ruin it, but eventually I wanted him to know and apparantly the guy is her nephew. The groom thanked me and said '' thanks for telling me'' I told him also to watch this guy for the rest of the evening.

0,"AITA for telling my kid I would help him get a Switch if he can beat Ocarina of Time? | My 10yo kid has been saving his money (birthday, allowance etc) for months now to get a Nintendo Switch so he can play BOTW. Right now he has $200 saved up. At his current allowance ($10/week) it will still take him months to be able to afford it.

I know he really wants it as all of his friends have one, and he hasn’t been obnoxious about it - just diligently saving up his money. Now I have to say, he’s a really good kid. Kind, smart, does his chores without complaining, friendly to everyone. He’s been making great grades in school and was even made captain of his soccer team.

Instead of making him do more chores to earn more money, I thought of a more fun solution to help him get his Switch. I told him, if you can beat Ocarina of Time (without Googling for help - though I would help him along the way if he got stuck) on my old N64, I’ll pay for the rest of your Switch and get you BOTW. Wife was initially opposed to the idea but then thought it could be a fun father son bonding thing, so she went along with it. Part of my reasoning too is I just want him to appreciate how far video games have come, and OoT is a timeless classic. 

He jumped at the idea! After a weekend of playing, he’s already at Zoras domain as young link. He seems to be having fun with it and hasn’t gotten too frustrated yet. He’s only played Minecraft really so the dated graphics don’t bother him either. 

But anyway I told a couple friends about it, and they think I’m a massive dick. That I’m trying to relive my childhood vicariously through my son, and that I should just get him the Switch because he’s already such a good kid. Now I’m having second thoughts and am feeling bad about it, but he does seem to be enjoying the challenge.

0,"AITA for messaging my sister to stop telling lies about me? | Hello Reddit,

As a result of the coronavirus, I \[27M\] am temporarily living with my parents and my sister \[23F\]. My sister has always been the favourite child, and is defended by my mother in all situations no matter how wrong she may be. My sister has been financially supported by our parents her whole life, and is currently the reason my father is unable to retire. I have very little respect for her. Despite this situation, I have made every effort to treat her well whenever we interact and I make sure I am not to blame for any breakdowns in the family.

Since moving home a month and a half ago, my sister has been consistently antisocial and hostile towards me. In itself, that's fine, but she then runs to my mother, in private, to spin the story around and make me a problem. My mother then comes to me to give me a stern talking to, which significantly strains my relationship with my parents. Some examples include:

\- My sister said she wanted an Xbox controller to play a game. I had a controller lying around and told hr she is welcome to borrow it, but she declined (for whatever reason). A few days later she demands the controller immediately, except I am working (remotely) and do not want to look for it now. She ran to my mother to tell her I was demanding money for the controller (make her buy it) and would not lend it to her.

\- I was making coffee in the kitchen recently. My sister comes in and aggressively asks me when it's her turn, then leaves. She was in there all of 10 seconds and told my mother I was preventing her using the kitchen 'for ages'.

I think my sister's lying, followed by my mother's validation is her way of coping with her own behaviour, which is probably easier than learning to co-exist with people. Anyway, I got tired of this cycle of bullshit and sent my sister a private message that read:

\> Stop lying about me to Mum and/or Dad. Lie about your work all you want, I don't care, but I am done with you repeatedly justifying your antisocial behaviour by lying when it involves me.

The work part relates to her lying to my parents about getting a job, which I witness consistently and hold my tongue on. When she got this message, she went to Mum and Dad and they lost their shit at me. Mum told me if I ever pull such a 'threatening stunt' again, I am to pack my shit and leave immediately. I thought I was 100% in the right, but for the first time my father is wholeheartedly siding with the rest of the family which makes me doubt myself.

So Reddit, in sending that message, am I the asshole here? How should I have handled it?",False,False
1,"AITA for making a coworker return a “small” amount of money she took without asking? |  I have a female coworker named “Steph”. Steph and I have never really seemed to get along, but we work well together. We have clashed a few times over a myriad of issues, but we mostly make it through the day, and are both experienced in our field.

So anyway, one day an auditor came in for a surprise inspection, and unfortunately, I was dinged for a few items. No big deal really. My supervisor educated me on it, and I learned from my mistake. During this time, I thought of a pretty neat idea that all my teammates could participate in, so that we don’t repeat the errors I was dinged for in the first place. I would make “swear jar” type or contest in which all employees had to throw in a dollar every time a particular infraction took place. It was fun and everyone seemed receptive to it, and in about two weeks we had about $15 in the jar. It was undecided what we would do with the money, but for sure it was going to be for something fun for the whole team, like a pizza party or a team outing.

So one day I come into work and I notice that the jar was empty. I found out through some coworkers that Steph emptied the jar, and spent the money on “sodas for lunch.” Apparently, our supervisor bought everyone pizza one day, but no drinks. Steph was a little upset about this, so she used the jar money on beverages for the team. I was visibly upset about this and approached Steph the next time we worked together to ask to her to please return the money. She replied “Well, our supervisor neglected to buy us beverages for the pizza, so I used the money for that”. I reminded her that the jar money was not for that purpose, and to please return the money. Steph then replied “Once our supervisor pays me the money she owes me for the party rentals, I’ll return the jar money” (At this point I should mention that we had our Xmas party at Steph’s house. Apparently she rented some tables and chairs for the party, and our supervisor was supposed to pay her back for the rentals, but never did.) I told her that I have nothing to do with that, this is a separate issue, and she still refused.

Time goes by, she got reimbursed for the chairs, and I repeatedly asked Steph to return the money, and she still refuses. For what reason, I don’t know. I tried everything, reasoning with her, publicly shaming her, etc. Finally, after many months, (seriously) I had enough and told our supervisor about Steph taking the money, and refusing to pay it back. Finally, after a lot of back in forth, Steph returns the money. But now, quite a few people at work are upset at me for “making a big deal out of it” and getting Steph in trouble. I personally don’t care about the backlash, and it’s the principle of the matter that matters to me. Some of my coworkers even told me “I can’t believe you made such a big deal over $15” And now I am second guessing my decision to tell my supervisor.

Am I the asshole?

She looks a lot younger than she is and sometimes the supervisor gets on her for things that aren't really a huge issue, but I think she is talking town to her because she looks like she is a teenager. I told her that she should dress older, which she did and the boss started talking down to her less. Anyways, yesterday she was supposed to print out a memo she had written and she accidentally misgendered a client in the memo (who is trans). She caught this typo shortly after printing out the memo and putting it in everyone's box. She panicked, ran down to the mailroom and frantically pulled all the memos and then reprinted the memos and replaced them in everyone's box. Instead of just telling the boss, she did all this because this lady is exceptionally hard on her and she was afraid she might lose her job for this small mistake. The only person who had taken the original memo out of the box was another young girl and she ran to this girls cubicle, asked her for the memo and replaced it with a new one and asked her not to tell the boss, which this girl promised not to. At lunch she went to staples and bought paper to replace the paper from the memo so the boss wouldn't catch all the missing paper. I thought it was kind of dishonest, so I told the boss what happened. The boss reprimanded her in the meeting in front of everyone and this girl started crying and left the office for the day. The other girl who know the problem came up to me after the meeting and told me I was an asshole for reporting her to the boss, and said the typo was not a big deal and she said I should have known the boss would have an unreasonable response and that this girl was just trying to save herself from this issue.

We're attempting to make new friends, but it can be slow going when you don't have any social networks. Last night my wife got home around 2 hours later than she normally does, but I figured she was probably out doing some chore. When she got home she started telling me about a friend she made.

They were stuck in traffic and had an sizable chunk of time to get to know each other. The uber driver goes to drop Tony off at his place, at which point he invites my up to his place to ""continue the conversation"". To my horror, my wife accepted and spent the last hour and a half at his place.  


She can tell I was annoyed as she recounted this and asked what was wrong. I was upset that she went into a strange mans house who was most likely trying to hit on her. She said I was being ridiculous and that she was just making a new friend. I brought up that if he did try something no one would know where she was at.

0,"WIBTA if I didn’t invite my autistic friend to my birthday party? | My friend, who we’ll call Alan, means a lot to me and I feel shitty for even thinking about this.

Alan is autistic with probably OCD. He needs things to be a certain way. 

For example, at a recent dinner that I had planned for a surprise birthday dinner for another friend, Alan asked for a picture of the seating arrangement. I explained that there was no seating arrangement and anyone could sit wherever. He then, very politely, explained that he was going to be surrounded by other people that he did not know and needed to know exactly where people will be sitting. He also asked to be seated at a specific area, in between specific people, and wanted to know what the menu was. As a result, I had to figure out how the seats would be arranged in order for him to feel comfortable. I also forwarded him a link to the restaurant’s menu.

He is also very picky with what he eats. As a result, he started to nitpick every single thing on the menu. “What is this?” “Why are we eating here?” “I can’t eat here.” “I don’t like the food.” “You sure you can’t go elsewhere?” etc. I chose this specific restaurant because it was our mutual friend’s favorite.

He also asked me if I finished making sure how the seats would be positioned and asked if the two people he wanted to sit in between knew where they were going to sit among other things.

He is my friend and I understand him so I did what I could to accommodate him.

But, now my birthday is coming up and I know inviting him will be the same thing. It’s my birthday and I don’t want to feel like making my birthday be work when I just want things to go smoothly and how I want it to be without thinking of what to do.

I've ordered from this company several times before, and in spite of the fact that the store is less than a mile away, it almost always takes at least an hour for the food to actually arrive.  I generally don't mind because it's still reasonably warm and is within the time frame for me to eat dinner, but the delay is definitely noticeable.

Anyway, I was paying by card, and there was an option to tip the deliver person, so I figured I'd go ahead and round the bill up to $25.00.  The deliver person (male, 20-24ish) arrived approximately an hour and twenty minutes after I received my order confirmation, and handed everything over.  However, after I said thanks and went to shut the door, he mumbled something, put my receipt on the pizza box, and then put three quarters on the box before turning and walking away.

He also said that he just can’t leave give everything up and just come with me without thinking things through. I told him that it was fine and I’ll be the only one to go and he can come visit every two weeks or so and we can FaceTime whenever we have time but I really couldn’t afford to lose out on this opportunity. He flat out said no and that the everything would be too expensive and would start adding up. He also said that I obviously didn’t care enough about him if I chose this job over him and stormed out. I haven’t heard from him in 2 days and his mother just called me incredibly selfish for this but I stood my ground and told her that this is an incredible opportunity for me. AITA?

My wife was supposed to be home at a certain time and we agreed that I would take a few hours after that to have some me time. Instead, she was over an hour late and she didn’t even contact me. Her excuse was that she was walking home and a woman was going into labor, so she stopped to help her. The lady ended up giving birth on the street. I’m not mad she stopped, but she didn’t contact me and she continued to stay with the woman even after the EMTs arrived. On top of that, even though she offered to watch the kids for longer, I missed the workout class I wanted to go to because she was late.

0,"AITA for taking naps after school? | My dad keeps getting extremely pissed off at me because I like to take naps after an hour of being home. It’s not an everyday thing but I do it pretty often and it helps me get through the rest of the day without being tired. 

He blames it on the games I play, but to be honest I don’t even play much on the weekdays anymore because once I take a nap, gym, shower, and dinner, it’s already late and I have to go to bed. 

The only problem with napping is the fact that I sometimes sleep through my alarm and wake up hours later, sometimes near my bedtime which happened today. I can see why he’s mad at me now but I normally don’t do this and it was just a mistake for me. 

He probably just wants me to do more after school but I’m over school right now and just want to get through my final weeks so I can enjoy summer break.

1,"AITA for refusing to let my ex take my child (not her biological child) | This is a complicated situation. Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I had a one night stand with a girl in college. She got pregnant and wanted to keep it in spite of me wanting nothing to do with it. She agreed to let me out of it and raise the kid herself, but she still came after me for child support so I've been paying out the ass for a kid I never wanted. I don't want to have anything to do with the kid. The mother is a materialistic, lying money grubber from what I can tell of the situation, so I just pay what I'm legally required to and stay the fuck away.

After this, I met my wife and got married. We had a daughter and the marriage disintegrated due to addiction problems on my end and mental health problems on my ex wife's end. After the divorce, my ex wife got in touch with my baby mama and they started getting the kids together and hanging out together in spit of the fact that I did not like this and did not want my daughter around that woman. 

My ex wife recently had a mental breakdown and isn't able to take care of our daughter. I am not able to care for her either due to my own financial and addiction problems that I'm working on. I would like our daughter to go into a group home until I or my ex is capable of caring for her, which will happen in the next few months. My ex wife wants my daughter to live with my baby mama. I put the veto on that, as she has to right to take in my daughter who she isn't even related to and I'm sure she's just doing it for the extra money. I don't trust her to care for my daughter as she requires and I wouldn't be surprised if she blows the money on herself and/or neglects my daughter. 

My ex wife is furious with me and blames me for our daughter being in foster care. I think I did what's best for her, as she will at least go to someone who has experience with kids in her situation and who is vetted and less likely to be abusing the system.

1,"AITA for telling my daughter she can't date anybody? | So I'm new to Reddit. I saw my teen son using it and it peaked my interest, so I figured I'd give it a try. I found this sub and it made me remember an event that happened a few months ago.

In January, my daughter who is 14 asked me if she could introduce me to her boyfriend. When she told me about a boyfriend I was very shocked and angry. I had always told her that she was not allowed to date boys until she was 18. She told me that her mother had told her that it was okay. Her mother and I are separated, so whenever she's at her mother's house, my rules don't apply. I think this is ridiculous because parenting should be equal. I told her that I forbid her from having a boyfriend until she's an adult. I think I'm being perfectly reasonable, but my daughter and my wife think I'm being an asshole. All boys that age just want one thing. I don't want my daughter to lose her virginity or end up pregnant or with an STD. Having a boyfriend at this age won't end well. It's my belief that children this age aren't mature enough for relationships. Am I being an asshole?",False,False
0,"AITA for bringing Kraft mac and cheese to my cousin’s potluck wedding reception? | My cousin “Shirley” (22F) got married last August. Half a year later and my family still won’t stop giving me grief for this, so here goes.

I (28M) was pretty surprised when word got around that Shirley and Brian (mid 20s M) were having a big wedding, about 200 people. Shirley’s family isn’t well-off (my mom has helped my aunt and uncle out with car expenses and stuff like that over the years). I don’t know what Brian and his parents do.

When the invitation arrived, I saw a line on the bottom asking that we bring a dish to pass. I was a little irritated because money was tight and I have a very small kitchen that’s not suited for cooking for more than 4 or 6 people. I had also already sent them a gift off the registry that they linked to on the wedding website that had already been up for awhile.

I have a “famous” in my family moussaka that I make for special occasions. It’s delicious, but it takes me awhile to prepare, and the cost of the ingredients really add up. When I called to RSVP, Shirley said she was hoping I would make about three or four 9x13 pans of it. (I don’t even have one 9x13 pan at home.)

I was pretty honest with Shirley and told her my situation, but offered to pick up a party tray at BJ’s. She sounded really hurt and said she wanted the reception to be a chance to share family recipes (combining the two families and all that), and this would count as my wedding gift. The wedding was a couple hours away where Brian’s family lives, so transporting it would be difficult, but Shirley said “nobody will care if it gets a little cold”.

Shirley said if I can’t bring the moussaka, then I should make another savory dish, “something cheesy”. And be sure to bring three pans of it.

I talked to my sister and I guess Shirley gave her the same speech. My sister said she was going to bring a veggie tray anyways. My mom and my brother, meanwhile, spent the night before slaving over multiple lasagnas. 

I ended up injuring my foot a couple weeks before the wedding. Feeling overwhelmed, I decided to keep things simple. Everyone in the family loves Kraft mac and cheese. So I got three foil pans and I made several boxes. I doctored it up with some parmesan and herbs I had at home and some bread crumbs on top.

When I got to the wedding and finished bringing all the mac and cheese from my car to the tables, I saw my uncle, who was setting up too, and he gave me a dirty look. 

He didn’t say anything but later it got out that Shirley and Brian were *livid* about the mac and cheese.

My family is kind of divided on it. My sister thinks that’s what Shirley and Brian get for asking people to bring food, but my mom thinks that I was being petty and I should’ve just sucked it up.

0,"WIBTA if I refused to print any more pictures of my daughter for my mother in law? | Ever since I had my baby both mine and my husbands family want pictures of her. This is normal, however where my family is fine with me sending them digital pics or sharing them in a dropbox, my MIL would always say ""Oh, I want this picture and that picture..! Print them for me!"". So I would prints pictures for her as well as for her parents who are in their mid eighties.

&#x200B;

I'm don't have a setup at home for printing so I usually go to the pharmacy or Costco where they have self-serve photo printing machines. Problem is this has gotten to be annoying. As my daughter got older it got harder and harder to multi task plugging my phone up to the self-serve machine and navigating menus, cropping, selecting sizes all while supervising my kid who is now old enough to attempt climbing out of the shopping cart or pulling things off of nearby shelves. Also, now that I've gone back to work, I simply don't have the time. My days are packed. On weekdays I work and take the kid to and from daycare. On weekends we cook, clean and run errands.

&#x200B;

I'm also getting annoyed with my MIL's entitled attitude. Once we were having breakfast with my husbands entire family as a final get together before my husbands grandparents (MIL's parents) left to spend the summer in their home country. The grandmother wanted some pictures of my baby to take with herand MIL just happened to have some on her. MIL didn't want to part with her copies and suggested I go and print more right after breakfast and then go drop them off at her parents' house before they leave to catch their flight (like we don't have anything better to do). I said it would be simpler for her to just hand over her pics to her mother now and I'll just print off more whenever. MIL said ok but only if I go make more copies right after breakfast. I said no (I had a good reason and was getting really annoyed at this point). Finally, my husband told her sternly to quit whining and give his grandma the pictures and that it won't kill her to wait a few days for new copies.

&#x200B;

MIL relented and gave the pics to her mother. Then my husband's aunt asked MIL why she won't just have me email her the pics and that's when MIL's response really annoyed me. MIL  ostentatiously wagged a finger back and forth in ""no, that won't do"" gesture (I hope I'm describing this well...) and declared ""No! I am old school. I want my pictures on paper!"".

&#x200B;

This annoyed me for two reasons. One: the snobby, entitled way in which she said this. Two: She is unemployed and thus has more time to go and print all the pictures she wants. But she won't because she either claims that she forgot her email password or her tablet is broken. There's always some excuse why I must make the prints for her and her parents.

0,"WIBTA if I took back my offer to pay for my uncle's estate planning after his wife got involved and his plans changed during the first consult with a lawyer? | My uncle has late stage cancer, and it will likely be terminal in the fairly near future.

I visited my uncle two months ago at the hospital, and he asked to speak with me alone, explicitly asking his wife, and others, to leave the room, and told me about some assets that he solely owned (\~$1-2 million in the form of apartment units) that he wanted my help dealing with so they could be put to best benefit our whole family.

In particular, he said he wanted to pay off all the student loans for his daughter and my brother (I have none), and wanted to leave some for my mom (his twin sister), as the property was inherited from their parents, and he felt he unfairly got a larger share than her, and he wanted to even it out, before leaving the rest to his wife and daughter, split equally.

A few weeks ago, I flew out to see him again, and it was the same story: he asked everyone else to leave, expressed the same wishes, and I found a good local lawyer, and offered to set up a meeting, and even cover the costs for the lawyer's time and any paperwork (despite the property, my uncle has little liquid assets and income).

Today, I flew down for the consult with the lawyer. When I got to their house to pick them up to drive to the lawyer, his wife insisted on coming, and my uncle, to my surprise, said ok.

At the lawyer's office, the story was suddenly different. After I reiterated my offer to pay at the start of the meeting, his wife did most of the talking, the story became that he would leave it all, directly, to his wife in a trust, with a clause that anything left after her passing would go to their daughter.

I didn't bring up the discrepancy beyond posing clarifying questions to give my uncle a chance to say something different. He didn't, and instead quietly agreed with how his wife had framed everything.

Afterwards, the lawyer sent over the engagement contracts, which are now sitting in all of our emails. This first meeting was the ""free consult"" and no fees have yet been incurred and I haven't yet signed anything, but everything is expected to take roughly $3k.

Now I'm considering taking back my offer to pay. I feel like this is not the same situation, and though I love my uncle, the thought of my mother and brother benefiting from this all was definitely a motivating factor for me in the first place.

WIBTA if I withdrew my offer to pay?

Separately, if I do withdraw the offer, what should I tell the lawyer about why I'm stepping back?

0,"AITA for telling my boss that I don’t want to serve her friends if they won’t speak to me? | For context: I work at a Korean restaurant and while I speak basic Korean, I am Welsh/American.

My bosses go to church regularly and have made plenty of friends through it. They own the only Korean restaurant in my county and their friends will often visit and order food, mostly to chat and catch up.

However, a majority of them refuse to speak to me or order through me even if we are busy. Another thing to note is that they all speak English due to either marrying an American or speaking to their friends spouses- so it’s not a language barrier.

I have made multiple attempts to get them to order but nothing works.

So one day it was just me and one of my bosses at the restaurant and we were busy, and his friends come in. I go up, greet them, and ask what they want when they side eye me and start addressing him. He even told them to order from me but they kept trying to get his attention, so I set the pen down and walk back to the kitchen to prepare our other orders.

We call his wife and she arrives about ten minutes later- ten minutes of them standing at the counter. They order from her and call me rude for leaving them there, so later I explained my side of the story.

I let her know that despite my dad not speaking English when he moved back to England, he still made an effort to order from restaurants or speak to cashiers. I also let her know that if they don’t want to speak to me- either in English or Korean- then I don’t want to serve them at all.

My aunt got me into the company we both work for and we are currently in the same position. There is only one way for us to grow in our company and as such we talked about how we both wanted to eventually move up and I even flat out asked her if she was going to be ok if I applied for any promotions and she said that it was fine. Well the time came sooner than either of us anticipated when we both got a call yesterday from our manager to notify us that a position unexpectedly opened and they would be having interviews today and making a decision tomorrow. I was ecstatic and immediately called her with the news and that's when everything changed. She didn't know I was getting interviewed too and she was acting really off. I could tell she wasn't happy and eventually after 10 mins of beating around the bush I flat out asked her if she was upset I was being interviewed. And that's when she told me that she would quit if I got promoted before her. Not that she would quit if she didn't get promoted... only if I got promoted before her. So if somebody else got the job it was fine.  I asked her if she wanted me to rescind my acceptance for the interview and she said no but it was all really passive aggressive for the rest of the conversation before it was finally so awkward that I got off the phone. 

We had interviews today and I wished her luck and I told her I would be happy if either one of us got the job. And I called her after our interviews  to see how it went for her and we both felt good about it. However, she kept asking me questions to get info on my interview but was really secretive and wouldn't answer my questions... 

I love my aunt but I really want this job. But half of me wants for her to get it just so that I dont have to keep worrying about us having to compete  every time a similar position opens. 

So AITA? Part of me thinks so because she helped get me the job and she's my aunt and my elder but I'm conflicted because I SPECIFICALLY asked her before this promotion even came up if she would be ok if I went after promotions and she said yes! 

TLDR: Aunt and I both interviewed for the same promotion. She helped me get into the company in the first place. I asked her if she was ok with me applying for promotions and she initially said yes but now that it's actually come up she says she will quit if I get the job before her.

0,"AITA for kicking out this mother from volunteering? | I volunteer often at a soup kitchen in my town (at least once a week) and I normally end up getting put “in charge”. Far too often, we get parents that are taking their kids there to “teach them a lesson in gratefulness” which I don’t agree with. Of course kids should be grateful, but I don’t think that people down on their luck are props for these people to use for a couple of hours. They can hear everything these people are saying, and it’s just degrading in my opinion. Teach your kids about being grateful and then you can also teach them that it’s good to give back, volunteer your time, etc. 

Then over the weekend, a mom brought her 12-year-old daughter in to volunteer. The mom had a smug look on her face and insisted her daughter serve food, so she “got a good look at the homeless”. Normally we don’t let kids scoop the food, but I did let her give out the rolls because it wasn’t worth the argument at the moment. The mother was scooping the food and to give her credit, she was being good with the people who were coming through the line. Her daughter looked like most of the kids that come, bored, unmoved. One outing at a soup kitchen isn’t going to turn your kid grateful for their iPad. But again, not my business, so we move on. 

The mom did keep making comments, however, to her daughter when we had a lull, such as “Do you see how good you have it?” and “Can you imagine how humiliating it’d have to be to come here?” it was annoying, but I just had to let it go because at least she wasn’t saying it in front of the people that were utilizing our services.

Then a bit later in the night, a girl that was probably in her later teens (but still a minor), came through the line. The mom started talking to her, and the girl shared that she had been kicked out of her home. As soon as she said this, the mother turns to her daughter and says, “You see, Rebecca, if you don’t stop with your smart mouth, this could be you some day!”

The teen looked humiliated. I was pissed. At this point, I finished serving the teenager, told her about services that could help her in the area and apologized. I then turned to the mother and said “You need to leave.” She said I couldn’t make her. I said she was being highly inappropriate and making the people feel uncomfortable. 

The mother tried to explain her daughter was ungrateful and I said “This isn’t the way, just get the hell out.” 

The daughter said “Let’s just go, Mom, this whole thing is stupid.”

The mom huffed, grabbed their stuff and they left. 

Now, I know this looks like a validation post…but it’s not. I was sharing this point of view and what happened with a fellow volunteer friend.

1,"AITA for going after a girl who rejected me until the point where the school intervened? | So, throwaway for obvious reasons.

This story consists of two people, me, and this girl. I need to get it straight that I loved her _a lot_. Like, I would have married her if we were older and going out. At the time I didn't regret any of this.

So it was the day before Valentine's Day and I plucked up the courage to ask her out. She tells me no but that I'm really sweet and that she's sorry it's how she feels. She also added that if I gave her a few months, ""maybe"" she'd develop feelings for me.

About a month later, I'm still madly in love with this girl and decide to try again. I wrote a song about her and sent it to her,  which she said she really liked so I got more hopeful. I wrote another one (looking back the lyrics are quite cringy) and sent it. She liked it and said no one had said things so nice about her. She was really keeping my hopes up (and we did flirt a bit anyway) but still doesn't like me.

Around another month later I write a letter straight from my heart to her about how I really feel. This letter contains some pretty deep stuff, and I make sure to put it in an envelope and pit ""READ WHEN ALONE"" on it. Her being stupid she opens it and reads it while in a lesson at school when her friends are around her. The rest of the class hear (because she's reading it out loud) and eventually the teacher catches on and goes to one of the heads of year because they're concerned (she actually texted me later saying the letter was sweet but she already knew my feelings for her and didn't need the letter). 

The school then starts an investigation and talk to the girl and she tells them about me asking her out and writing the songs (I think she told them about everything because we had a falling out a few days before). They decide that I've don't something really wrong. They make me go to see a doctor to talk about the situation (or else they'd bring someone in to talk to me). I get a day in insolation (in a room for the whole day in silence doing work) and the news spreads and people gossip about it for the next few months.

Basically, my friends all think this is creepy but I say I was just doing it out of true love and that they don't know what it feels like. Bare in mind I have come to kind of regret it now. I didn't intend on anything bad happening and I'd really like some opinions.",False,False
0,"AITA for stretching in spandex shorts opposite a church | About once a week I run speed intervals for training. There aren't any running tracks near my house but about 1km away there is a quiet residential road which is flat, quiet, and almost exactly 400m long (the same length as a track). At the end of the road is a small local parish church. 

&#x200B;

When I'm training intervals I usually jog the 1km to the road to warm up, stop and do some dynamic stretching, and then start my intervals (normally 400 or 800m long). In-between intervals I have short recovery sessions, where I'll sometimes jog slowly, walk, or stretch.

&#x200B;

The other day I was doing some stretching between reps on the bench at the end of the road, which is opposite the church. The weather recently has been fairly warm, but very grey and wet, so I was wearing a lightweight long-sleeve top to keep the worst of the rain off, and spandex running shorts (something like [this](https://www.nike.com/gb/t/fast-running-shorts-2c26G6)) because I figured I would be too hot in leggings. An older woman came up to me and told me that I was being very disrespectful for lingering and stretching in such small shorts outside a church, especially as there were also a lot of primary schools in the area. I apologised and moved onto another street to finish my intervals and stretching, but it wasn't really an ideal place to do speed sets because it's a lot busier and I often end up having to stop for cars during the intervals. 

&#x200B;

So was I being disrespectful? I wasn't raised Christian and I don't want to upset people who are if what I was doing really was offensive. I would never do it on a Sunday morning when people are going into/coming out of a service, but this was around 3pm on a Monday afternoon and it seemed to be closed. Also as a Jew, I would feel perfectly comfortable doing the same outside a synagogue as long as it wasn't on a Saturday morning/holiday. I also wasn't deliberately trying to appear provocative at all, I was just doing some calf stretches ([like this](https://cdn1.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/articles/322/322809/calf-wall-stretch.jpg)) because my calf/achilles were giving me a bit of bother.

If I'm the asshole I'll try and find another place for the summer, because it's going to be too hot to wear leggings most of the time.

Late last year my Mother in law wanted to sell her car, so we posted it for sale on Facebook. We had a lot of people enquire, and wanting to look, but not until the next day.
Anyway, it was around 9pm and this woman asked if she paid in cash, would we sell to her for a grand less than asking price, putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that she had ""cash waiting"". I asked MiL and she said yes as the car had no battery (which was in the ad). The woman then said she could come that same night, around 10pm and pick it up, with cash. Again, MiL said yes, although not super impressed about her coming that late, but she wanted the car gone. So, we started to make sure everything was in order with the car, double checking there was nothing left inside, my husband even went to charge the battery to see if it still worked so she could test drive.

It was around 10pm by now, and this woman messages me saying that she can't come now. But that she will be there at 8am in the morning, that way she could bring a battery with her. I say, sure, but is she sure about 8am as others are interested (which is true). She says definitely 8am.

The next moring comes, and not too long before 8am, woman messages saying she will be a little late. I say okay, thinking like 10-15 minutes.

We ended up waiting an hour, and we decided after messing around the previous night, and with other potential buyers waiting, that we wouldn't be selling to her.
I messaged the woman and politely explained this, and that's where it went down hill.

Directly after this message the woman states that she is on her way, and that she just had to get the money out at the bank (although she apparently had cash waiting last night?).
I say again that we are going with another buyer, and she doesn't seem happy, saying she's just near our street, and she had to get money out, got stuck in traffic, that I'm rude, and accuses me of being offered more, and that's the only reason why I am no longer selling to her (genuinely not why, we just didn't want to wait any longer).
I calmly explain again why we went with another buyer, due to the wait, etc. and say goodluck in finding a vehicle.

Looking back, I do feel bad, as I am not usually the type to say no, or change my mind. I'm usually a complete push over, and I do what I can to be helpful. But, I was already running late for things I had planned that morning, time is valuable, and I was not in the mood for people and their shit. Others were genuinely interested like I said, too. 
I also had a gut feeling that she was going to try to get the price down even more, or that she was going to cancel again and wasn't even on her way. She just had that vibe.
I told her not to contact me anymore after she said what she needed to, and she thankfully didn't.

We ended up selling the car to a nice lady who paid only $500 less than asking price, and we bought a battery and installed it for her. So, it worked out in the end.

TL;DR:

Woman organized 2 different times to come and buy a car with cash, canceled the first time, then left us waiting an hour the second time. 
I explain we're no longer selling to her due to this, and she makes up excuses and calls me rude.

0,"WIBTA for moving out and leaving my boyfriend and roommate to pay 1800 in rent every month? | Long story short, my boyfriend believes in polygamy, so does my roommate. They have both known for 2 years I'm not okay with it, and continue to sneak behind my back and sleep together. The other day I cried to them and told them this was hurting me (I've done this many times before), still didn't matter to them. I'm the asshole for not accepting their ""love"", and being ""envious"". I'm not saying polygamy is wrong, but if your partner continues to sleep with other people (she's not the only one), while you continually tell them that it's bothering you, I don't believe this is okay. This is especially painful for me, because I gave my boyfriend my virginity, and was planning on marrying him. They're also not the best at upkeeping the house, and I do most of the cleaning. My problem is if I leave, their parents are the ones that will have to pay this much rent, and I don't think they deserve to do this.

1,"AITA for playing music over my Bluetooth speaker on a public hiking trail? | Where to begin with this...

I guess I need to say up front I'm not an outdoors type person. But I was sort of excited to go on a hike yesterday. We are in San Diego for the fourth of July and my cousin said it would be really fun if me and my friends went on a hike while she (cousin) had to work. We went to a place called Cowles mountain which I guess is about 45 minutes away from the hotel downtown. 

When we got there it was pretty crowded and we saw a group of guys coming down who were just blasting rap music. I was like wow that would be an awesome way to not get bored on the hike so I went back to my car and got my blue tooth speaker from my pack and hit my favorite spotify list. 

Most people didn't seem to mind but I did notice that we started to get occasional dirty looks. But finally one person stopped me and told me it was incredibly rude to play music outloud and that I should be using headphones. I told her that I was playing music for our group. And she basically that it's still very rude and against the rules but she kept walking. 

We decided we just weren't going to make it to the top so we stopped at a kind of flat spot and sat down for a while and this is when things actually got kind of scary. This guy and his girlfriend came up to us and said again that I should be using headphones. I told her that we were in a group. She said that it didn't matter most people were trying to enjoy quiet nature. I told her that that its public land. She said ""if you weren't such an ignorant fat bitch you would have noticed the sign at the bottom that said no speakers."" I basically shut down because I'm not good at confrontation but my friend asked her if she wanted to repeat herself. So the girlfriend called her a fat bitch as well and her boyfriend had to drag her away she was so upset. I didn't want any more hassle so I turned off the speaker and they walked away but the girl was just glaring at us and I was actually scared that they would slash my tires or something at the bottom. 

I have been reliving the confrontation over and over again and didn't sleep last night. I admit to being fully ignorant because I don't do a lot of outdoor stuff but was that really a big deal? I mean at least one other group we saw was doing it so I can't be that out of touch? All I was trying to do was make it a little more enjoyable and really meant no offense. 

I posted this on another sub and was referenced here so i'm a little scared just because of the title but please be honest with me.

1,"AITA for telling my wife to take a painkiller and telling her to stop feeling so sorry for herself? | I've (40M) got 3 children from a previous marriage 11,10,8 and we have two together 3 and 1.

I've been with my wife (31F) for 6 years now.

Usually during her ""time of the month"" she spends 4 out of 7 days in bed because, I'm going off what she says, they're so painful it leaves her unable to do anything even with painkillers - she doesnt always take painkillers and tries to get through the pain as she puts it.

We had begun to think she was pregnant since despite being frequent she hadnt had her time of the month for 2 months after her last one being  10 days, she was considering going to the doctors but has decided it isnt an emergency.

She promised the children as soon as the paddling pool arrived, on the day we would put it up and she would spend all day outside with ALL of the children since we have been busy.

Paddling pool arrived today and so did her time of the month early last night.

As usual shes in bed.

Children have been begging to play outside, with her.

I asked her if she wanted painkillers and when she is getting up, she said she didnt and isnt.

Day progressed and children got more and more whiny and she refused to deal with it while I was in a meeting.

I may have snapped when I got a small break, I told her to either explain or take a painkiller and stop feeling so d-mn sorry for herself.

She got all teary eyed and basically screamed at me that I'm an insensitive ass, got up and played with them for the day (extremely annoyed and snappy though, not towards the children)

 I saw that my son was staring and was going to tell my daughter to look too, so I called my kids over and said “Do you see that man over there, he has no legs and that very sad and unfair, but we can’t stare at him and we can’t laugh at him okay? I know it seems a little weird but we need to treat him like anyone else, got it?” 

Well my daughter was having some trouble identifying who it was I was talking about, don’t ask me how, but I pointed at him so she could see, and right as I raised my arm and started pointing he looked up and froze while just looking at me. I froze too, but then I tried to play it off as stretching my arms, so I stuck out my other one and did a similar motion but in hindsight I don’t think anyone bought it, i was so embarrassed that I just did the first thing that came to mind, no matter how stupid.

0,"AITA for being upset my non-vegetarian coworkers ate the only cheese pizza first? | I've been at my current job for about a year and I'm the only vegetarian in our office, which has about 30 people total. We had a lot of work to wrap up before Thanksgiving, so management decided to treat us by ordering pizzas for everyone for lunch on Wednesday. They made this announcement on Monday. I usually bring/make my own lunch because money is tight at home right now, but since the office was planning to provide lunch this time, I didn't bring anything to eat on Wednesday.

So on Monday we were all discussing what kind of pizzas to order on the office Slack channel. Originally my coworkers wanted to place an order for six large meat pizzas: two pepperoni, two sausage, and two BBQ chicken pizzas that this particular pizza joint is known for. I piped up on Slack and asked if one of the pizzas could be a cheese pizza since I was vegetarian and couldn't eat the other ones. Everyone said sure and agreed to swap out one of the sausage ones for a cheese one. All good.

Fast forward to Wednesday. My boss went to pick up the pizzas a little before noon. When he got back, I was stuck on the phone with a client who needed immediate assistance and ended up being the second to last person to get in line. By the time I got to the table where all the pizzas had been laid out, the entire cheese pizza had already been eaten. It was the only pizza that was entirely gone; there were still slices left of all of the other ones. I didn't get to eat anything and was really annoyed.

I went back on our Slack channel and asked if next time someone could please leave me one slice of the cheese pizza, and several of my coworkers jumped in and got really defensive, saying the pizza was fair game for everyone. Nobody apologized. To be clear, I never wanted the whole pizza to myself and I fully expected some of my coworkers to take some slices too. But they had five whole meat pizzas to choose from, and the cheese pizza was the only one I could eat of the bunch, and they knew that. I don't know if I was out of line to hope my coworkers would take that into consideration. AITA?",False,False

1,"AITA for not understanding how painful a woman’s period cramps can be? | So this isn’t super recent but my friend recently brought up an event that I had forgotten from a few years ago.

This event occurred when I was 17 in Junior college. My class consisted of 20 people, 5 guys and 15 girls. So basically there was this girl in my class that often left school early complaining of period pains. She would simply get up, pack her bags and waltz straight out the door saying she had period pains. The teachers normally did not stop her but if they did she would glare at them until they let her go.

So, me being a young man, decided to complain to my friends, a group of girls, about how she was faking it and skipping school. They didn’t have none of my shit and proceeded to criticize me about not understanding how a girls body works, how period pains were the worst feeling in the world and how insensitive I was.

0,"WIBTA if I throw away the dollhouse my sister made for my daughter? | One of my sisters made my daughter a dollhouse for her second birthday. It was a really sweet idea and gesture but there are a couple of issues my husband and I have with it:

This dollhouse is ridiculously massive and takes up a lot space (like double the size of a normal store bought dollhouse). It is made of a bunch of materials like cardboard and recyclables that she painted and put together. It has alot of sharp edges literally all over, and there is glue EVERYWHERE, and it smells awful. We haven't put it in her room yet because we feel it's so unsafe.

There are a couple of issues we have with it: A) we feel like she is going to hurt herself on it and b) we don't want her inhaling all that glue, and c) the size (it currently takes up way too much space in our house). And to be honest, we would much rather buy her a safer, smaller plastic dollhouse with less sharp edges and super glue smell to it.

I feel awful because I know how hard and long she worked on it, and it was honestly so nice of her. It would crush her if she found out we threw it out. I am not sure what to do at this point.

0,"AITA for refusing to be a part of my fiancés car shopping/buying process? | Fiancé (F32) was having trouble with her 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee. After a series of failed repairs, we decided it was best for her to look for a new car. She had been having trouble with it for years.

She asked me (M30) for help. We did our own  hunting to narrow down options. I found reliable small SUVs in our area. I found serviceable Hondas and Toyotas in the $10,000-$13,000 range. They had low miles on them and were in good shape, likely to last a long time.

We presented our lists. Her list consisted entirely of Jeeps, starting around $22,000 up to $30,000. She said that they were ""so ugly"" and that she wouldn't drive them. She was also upset by the price range. She insisted that she didn't want to buy a ""piece of shit"" and that she could afford to get a ""nicer"" vehicle.

I protested her choices and said I didn't understand why she would pick out Jeeps after the trouble she had with her Grand Cherokee. She said that she ""just likes"" Jeeps and that is what she wants to buy. I mentioned the reliability issues but she blamed them on the car being old.

I asked her to write down a list of ""must-haves"":

* must be a Jeep Cherokee; preferably Grand Cherokee
* must be black
* must have a V6
* cannot be a ""fake"" Jeep like a Latitude or Compass
* less than 40k miles

She refused to test drive anything if it didn't match ALL of her needs. She was being stubborn.

A week later, she goes out to lunch with her mom. She came home and said she went to test drive a Jeep and ""fell in love"". It was $27,000. I told her we couldn't afford it and she said she planned to put $8k down. I explained that $19k was a lot to finance.

She called the dealership later and it sold. But there was a 2015 Jeep Cherokee that she wanted to try out that was less expensive. I went with her and she decided that was the car she wanted. I tried to talk her out of it but I acquiesced and she bought it.

Since December 2018, she has had problems with it. The first issues happened within her warranty. However, she has had problems since the warranty has lapsed and it's cost her some money to repair. She has been a victim of the ""Service Shifter"" light going on. Apparently, lots of people have had this problem. I told her she should contact the dealership to take a look at it, and asked her to give me her VIN so I can see if there has been any recalls.

She said that she ""no longer feels safe"" driving the car and wants a new car. I told her she was overreacting and that we would get it fixed and keep it on the road since it has 50k miles on it. She told me she was ""done"" with this Cherokee.

She emailed me a bunch of links to cars she ""wants to look at"" and **THEY'RE ALL JEEP FUCKING CHEROKEES.**

I replied by telling her that I don't want to be a part of this search, or the buying process if it's going to be the same as last time. I told her that if she insists on buying another Jeep, I will not be a part of it.

&#x200B;

My roommate recently moved out to head home across the country. The lease doesn't end until September so he had to find someone to take his place. I'm not sure if he knew or not, but it ended up being a couple that moved in (which, while against university rules, isn't something I cared about).

&#x200B;

I got off on the wrong foot with this couple because they were using some of my stuff without asking (food, cookware, etc). After I talked to them about it, I agreed to let them use my cooking stuff as long as they bought their own food and cleaned my cookware immediately. Quite often they don't actually clean my cooking stuff though and I'll have to do it before cooking, though.

&#x200B;

Another thing that was bothering me was them staying up late and being generally loud with friends. The university has a no-noise policy during the summer, as in, if you can be heard from your neighbour's rooms you can get in trouble. They've gotten our room warned twice (both while I was away) since they moved in, and I've been worried that it'll lead to fines. I've asked them to keep it down, since I work starting at 8 every morning, but they don't really seem to listen.

Yesterday my girlfriend and I had a midterm exam, so the night before she and I were studying in my room while they were hanging out and being very noisy. I asked them twice to quiet down since we were studying, and it didn't really seem to have any affect. After that, I decided to call the university police and explain the situation. A few minutes later the officers came to the door and ended their party or whatever, which is honestly what I was hoping for, but it ended up going further than that...

&#x200B;

The officers realized they had cannabis and also put two-and-two together that the couple were living together in the room, against the residence agreement. This morning, the new roommate had an eviction notice, as well as a notice that they were considering academic discipline measures (possible suspension from the university). They are really upset with me, because obviously they figured out I'd reported them. AITA for this?

He then sort of screamed at me saying ""I just looked over your answers as fast as you did them."" He then called me rude for acting bored and lazy in his class and for making fun of the work. He walked away, and I was kind of stunned. I didn't think i did anything wrong. He came by my desk at the end of class and told me we need to respect each other.

There's a fair that comes to town for 2 weeks every year, always at this time. (Google Dixie Classic Fair)

I've been looking forward to it for a multitude of reasons. One of them being seeing my daughter react to the petting zoo, all the animals they have, and getting to see some unique things. We take her to feed horses about once every 2 week because she's completely fascinated by animals. Even cats or rabbits so we knew large animals would impress her.

I want to get to enjoy the fair one time with just the 3 of us. Slow walking the fair and getting to spend the day as a date of sorts. Her son is at school weekdays so my suggestion was a time when he was still at school. 

She is pissed at me for this. Telling me he's part of the family and we can't exclude him from activities like this. For the record, my suggestion was to go more than once. It's not like I don't want to go with him, or don't think he should go. He's just so hyper, and is going to want to ride all the rides, which is awesome, and I can't wait to get to do that with him. I just also want one trip where it's relaxing and we get to just experience this with the baby. I don't see anything wrong with us taking more than one trip, one with him as a whole family, and one with just us three while he's at school.

I'm half drunk and half hungover, I have a headache and in general I don't feel that great. He's having a great time laughing and being very animated with his friend. I asked him if he knows that it's 5 a.m.( he later tells me that he did know) and I tell him that he should come to bed. He can't answer me because his friend is on the other side of the mic so I go back into my bed. He tells his friend to hang on and he comes over to me and I reiterate what I said once again. He agrees and then goes and turns off the PS4 without even saying goodbye to his friend. This is when I felt like I had done something wrong. I wanted him to come to bed but I wasn't requesting he get off the PS4 immediately. I usually snuggle him in bed but I just felt in general shitty and we both just fell asleep after that. I got the feeling that he was disappointed and I hated the feeling of being like his mom. He's still sleeping and he probably will be until about one or two p.m.

1,"AITA for refusing to replace a drink that my toddler knocked over because the girl was rude | I was at baggage claim at the airport with my son, who’s 3. We were leaving and as we’re walking away, this girl yells “excuse me!” At me. I turn and she points to her Starbucks drink which is spilled on the floor and says “your kid did that.”

I ask my son if he spilled it and he said he bumped it. The girl says “it was $5” and looks at me expectantly. I was pissed about how rude she was and the way she was just looking at me and expecting me to pay for her mocha frappa-whatever without even asking, so I just shrugged and walked away.

0,"AITA for objecting to future SIL’s use of family wedding veil? | My younger brother “James” is getting married to “Lisa”, and they are planning on having some unconventional aspects to their ceremony, like Lisa wearing a wedding dress with a black pattern. She expressed to me that she wants to wear a wedding veil that my great-grandmother wore and so has every woman on my side of family since (including me) for their wedding. Lisa said she wanted to wear something from James’ side because she’s not really close to her own immediate family. I was initially delighted to hear she wanted to, but then Lisa said that she plans on permanently shortening the veil because that would feel more like “her” and feel like it’s a joint union of her background and James’. I got really upset because not only is it completely defacing the veil to me, but it essentially ruins the veil for anyone else, like my young daughter who I want to have the veil on her future wedding day. Lisa told me that’s it’s selfish to not allow her to do this “one small thing” and stormed out—I got a text from James calling me an asshole for getting her upset over a small thing.

0,"AITA for refusing to throw my sister in law a baby shower after I had already offered? | When I found out my SIL was pregnant the first thing I told her is to not worry about her baby shower. I told her that I will throw it at my house and I will pay for everything and to not stress about it. The only thing she had to worry about is set a date and give me a guest list. I kept reminding every other week. “SET A DATE GIVE ME A GUEST LIST. SET A DATE GIVE ME A GUEST LIST.” This went on for months, no date no guest list. Last weekend we were at a girls brunch and one of our friends asked her when her baby shower is, she replied and said “Next week at Dara’s (me) house.” I was not told of this but I just nodded and smiled as to not cause a scene and embarrass her. In private I told her that, this is all very last minute.
I own my own business and work over 10 hours a day! I told her that I have been asking for her to set a date for months in advance and she did not follow through. I refused and said sorry and left it at that. A few days later she starts sending me baby shower ideas and decorations and numbers for bakeries to order her baby shower cake from. She even sent me a guest list and a time of when she wants the baby shower to happen (5 Days from today). I told her again I was not gonna do it because it’s last minute. I don’t operate this way.

0,"AITA for suggesting I don't pay my parents back? | This is on behalf of my older sister - I watched all the arguments go down, so I'm posting. 

When my older sister (24f) was 19, she had a lot of money saved, and when our dishwasher broke - my mother asked her if she wouldn't mind using about $900 to get a new dishwasher. It wasn't the landlords responsibility because we had bought and installed the dishwasher ourselves - so it was considered ""our"" problem. Sister said yes. 

Fast forward to last year and my sister lost her job of 7 years and then lost the replacement job she got due to some illnesses she was going through. Her old job let her go saying she wasn't working up to par and then her new job lied to her, said they didn't require medical certificates and then fired her for not providing medical certificates. So - while waiting for government assistance which took her 2 months - she quickly blew through her savings on rent and bills. 

She was trying to borrow money for rent and our parents offered to pay for 3 months of rent - and she pay them back when she can. After they paid the money - they were quick to change their minds and set up various terms and conditions for the loan. They wanted access to my sisters bank account so that they could control how much she was spending, and wanted my sister to stop going to the basketball team she was on (and had been on for several years that was helping her mental health and keep her physically in shape) for at least a year until she had paid them back, paid her debt (which total would only take 3 months seeing as she got a new, better paying, supportive job at the start of this year), and had 3000 dollars in savings. They wanted complete access to her bank account until all that occured. 

So my sister obviously didn't like that - but because she had already accepted the money and they'd paid it, she wasn't sure what to do. She then had an idea and asked if she could ""call it even"" from the dishwasher she bought (and still had the receipt for) from ages ago. They have now been screaming at her for the last hour about how selfish she is and that buying the dishwasher was her being a good child and 'paying her way' for living there as an adult and are now demanding MORE conditions for her accepting this loan. So - is sister the asshole for even suggesting this - and is sister the asshole now if she (as she is currently telling me she wants to do) just stops talking to my parents in a couple of days because of it all?",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I tell my land lady that another tenant forced me to move my car from my designated spot? | So I’ve been living at an apartment building in California for around 7 months now. When I moved in I got a parking spot in the garage. My car is to sit on the right hand of the front, and on trash days I park in the back of the garage to allow the trash cans to go outside. 

Now this hasn’t been a problem. The girl I park next to doesn’t like to share space in the front (she doesn’t leave much room for me to get out of the drivers side) but I don’t move my car much except weekends so I park in the back indefinitely since that’s technically an extension of my spot. 

When I moved in I noticed an electric scooter charging in the back by my car. The landlady only told me about the girl I’d park next to in the front and that the rest of the garage was for storage and laundry. The scooter didn’t affect me at first since it was out of my way, and was usually parked out on the street. 

Now I get an email from the tenant who owns the scooter telling me to move my car into the back because he can’t access the charging spot. I say ok because I’m having a bad day and don’t need conflict. This resident has also been here for 9 years. 

My lease specifically said no electric vehicle charging. The meters are messy and actually I pay the bill for the building technically since every other apartment got metered on its own except mine (weird set up, landlady knows about it and we have a deal on what to do). I’m kind of concerned he’s adding to my electric bill by having his scooter in the back, but mainly irritated he made me move my car from the front of the garage. 

So WIBTA if I reached out to my landlady to confirm that he’s not supposed to be parking there? I don’t want to create conflict, but I don’t want my electric bill to be higher than it needs to be if he’s doing this covertly.",False,False

We were on a vacation with his family and I haven't been able to sleep in or nap or really relax. We've been going to the beach, hitting shops, doing something non stop. I was complaining about how tired I was, and he said 'i understand'. And I was just not feeling good so I told him 'im not sure you'll ever understand how this feels'.

1,"AITA for making a joke about not knowing who “Megan Slaw” is in front of a cop? I was honestly trying to be funny. | I won’t make this too long. Last night I was at a family gathering and a friend of a friend was a cop. In my home town a few years ago we had a very high profile case of a little girl abducted from her room (the trial is now in its beginning stages, which is why it was topic of discussion) and the cop had been on the case as a rookie.

He said something like we needed a tightening of “Megan’s law” to help cases like this in the future because maybe word didn’t get out early enough to help this poor girl. I was trying to be clever and lighten the mood a little bit so I said “Megan Slaw? Who is she? Does she do a blog or twitter or something?”

To me it was a bad joke that bombed horribly, to this cop I was a total asshole and he actually got up and left the party he was so offended.

0,"AITA for not wanting to be near my parents while they were eating at a party? | This Sunday I was at a friend's birthday party. I was having lots of fun, and eventually, around 8 my parents came to pick me up.

So to put a little background, I have misophonia. My mom was supportive at first, but now she isn't that much. My dad thinks that misophonia is linked to an eating disorder (??????) and that I only get annoyed when he eats.

My parents decided to stick around at the party, because they got locked out of the house and the dad of my friend is a locksmith, so he was going to fix the problem.

My dad was eating a sandwich and my mom a pizza slice. 

I was standing near a friend, and my dad came and stood right next to me chewing really loudly. I moved very subtly, and told my friends if they wanted to go inside. 

A while later, they cut the cake, and my dad come again, chewing louder than before, and talks to me with a mouth full of cake. I was horrified. I answered his question and left.

Then I noticed he kept giving me ugly looks and was talking about something with my mom.

Later in the car, he started yelling at me because of what I did. My dad and mom think that my misophonia is all made up, and that I'm doing it to feel like I belong somewhere. I got PISSED and told them that it's horrible to live with this and that I've begged them multiple times to take me to a psychologist, but they don't. My mom says everybody's problems are in their head, and that I control it, and to just tell myself to stop.

I wish it would be that easy.

After that, my mom keep bringing it up, calling it a disorder and saying I'm getting crazy. She also keeps saying that it's weird, and that I ruin the days because of it.

And my dad keeps coming at random moments and saying stuff like ""from now on, you can't breathe, because it annoys me"". Or if the dogs are eating, he says ""oh, so why don't the dogs anger you, huh?"".

He’s not very bendy, so he said he couldn’t reach it himself, and asked if I could help him remove it when I got home.

Of course, I told him, but I’d be a while because I was still at work, still needed to run some errands, get groceries, Etc. I figured it it being just a splinter, I didn’t need to drop everything and rush home.

Cue a couple hours later, I walk into our condo, say hi, but he barely answers because he’s busy on the phone with his friend. My cat had managed to escape into the hallway when I got home, so I put down the groceries and went off to catch my cat. Down the hall, I could hear my husband screaaaaaming for me at the top of his lungs, even with our door closed. I grabbed my cat, got back go our unit, and asked him wtf is up with his shouting.

So he starts shouting that he’s in pain, has been waiting for me for hours, and was mad I had let the cat out to begin with. So I tell him to calm down, let me go wash my hands and grab the tweezers, and told him to put his foot up. I return with the supplies and he’s still fuming about how late I am, how he’s been in pain, and should’ve just gone to the hospital instead of waiting for me, blah blah blah.

So I gave him the raised eyebrow, gave him a half-laughing “are you serious”,  and said he was acting like a big baby. So, still fuming, he said “Fine! Forget it.

0,"AITA for getting mad at my mom for throwing me a birthday party | So today’s my birthday and a while ago my parents asked me what I wanted to do. I specifically told them I wanted to do absolutely nothing. I didn’t just say “nothing”. I made it clear that I wanted to sit in my room and do absolutely nothing because they’ve made the mistake of confusing “nothing” for “hey I have no expectations so just throw a small last minute get-together. 

I said nothing because I’ll be going back to college in a week and I know my friends are throwing me a party and I’m not really the type of person to enjoy a lot of parties. 

So back to today, I wake up and repeat that I want to do absolutely nothing but alas I get called downstairs in the evening and my mom tells me to change into nicer clothes and come greet our guests as she’s invited a whole bunch of neighbors and friends. 

I don’t want to make a scene so I change and come downstairs but I take my mon aside and I’m like ??????  and asking her why tf she did this while also getting mad at her. Her response was basically that my sister wanted to cut a cake(she’s 9 and I just turned 20).

0,"AITA for refusing to cook after my brother refused to pick me up, despite our agreement he would? | I live in my parents’ rental apartment with my brother, John. I work a pretty sweet gig at a vet office, he goes to university. We have an agreement, he is the only one with a car (parents got it for him when he got accepted in his current uni program) so he drops me off and picks me up from work, and I do all the cooking and cleaning at home. Yeah, we are the kind of family where mom would have a heart attack if she saw *a man doing household chores*. Whatev, that works well for us most of the time.

Yesterday, I was waiting for John (at 4:30pm) after work, as he usually picks me up then. He confirmed by text he was on his way, but time passed and he didn’t show up. At 5:15, I called him to see if he had a problem on the way, but he told me “Oh, I was feeling tired so I went straight home, just take the bus.” If he had told me ahead of time I would have taken the 5pm bus, but now I was forced to wait for the 6pm bus and got home past 7. To be clear, John’s commute is 12 min normally, and 16 if he takes the slight detour to get me (thanks google maps), so it’s not like it would have changed much for him. I do take the bus often to and from work, when our schedules don’t match, but I like to know in advance when that happens.

When I got home though, John was laying on the sofa watching Netflix, AND HE DARED TO BE PISSED AT ME FOR BEING HOME LATE. He said “Fucking finally, what took you so long? I’m starving, hurry up and make dinner.” I just lost it, I screamed at him that I’m not his personal cook and that he didn’t keep his end of the agreement so I’m not keeping mine. I had a sandwich while waiting for the bus, so I locked myself in my room and didn’t cook (John can’t even use a microwave, at best he can throw a salad together). I ignored him pounding on my door and demanding I cook, and I went straight to bed.

This morning, I took the bus to work and was greeted by about a million texts from my parents. They are super pissed off and telling me that they let me live free of charge in their apartment because “it makes university easier for John,” and that they will evict me if I “keep acting out.”

I know they value university a lot and hate the fact I opted out to go straight into the workforce, and I get it studying is hard, but it’s like they only see me as a live-in maid for my dickhead brother.

0,"AITA for telling my brother's girlfriend that she has to move. | Ok, so a while ago something happened to my brother's girlfriend's home and he asked me if she could stay with us for 3 weeks.

Now, I don't have any children because I don't want any. It's just a personal choice for me. So, our 2 bedroom apartment all of a sudden goes from 2 people to 5. It was very crowded but I figured that it wouldn't be that long and that I could deal with it.

11 months later they're still here. Finally I told him that they need to find an apartment because she has no plans on leaving. She just wanted to live with him. He got upset at first but I put my foot down. Keep in mind that she worked the entire time , full time, and only gave us 100 a month for almost a year. She should've saved a lot of money.

0,"AITA for not liking that my mom's pregnant? | Hi! 
I am a 17yo female and just got into college (economics) (my first day was literally last week). 

Okay... Here's some background story:
My parents had me when they were teens, so none of them were really present until I was a teen (grew up with my grandparents). They are not together anymore (broke up when I was 5). My mom got married to another guy (I was probably 14/15yo). 

I've been a only child my whole life. My mom always paid for my school and bills. But was never really there for me. Basically had to grow up and mature on my own. 
The first time I met my stepfather was on the day he moved in. (Yeah... My mom made me live with a guy whom I barely know). So I never really got close to him. And we have this weird relationship were we are NOT family but not strangers. 

Like I said I got into college last week (my mom insisted she wanted me to get into a private college and that she would pay for it, even though public colleges here in my country are better). Yesterday my mom literally turned to me and said ""I have a news for you.  I'm pregnant"". Out of utter shock I simply say: "" Soo?!...  I do not know where you are going to put a child in this house "" (Fyi. In my country kids do not leave their parents house until they are financially stable, and buying a new house is very expensive). We got into this new apartment last year and it has 2 bedrooms + 1 study room. 
So she tells me that I'll probably have to leave the house. As if it is a completely normal thing to simply kick out you kid to get another one in their place. 
I've always known that my mom didn't care that much and actually had some resentment towards me (because she had me at a very young age. She couldn't simply live the life she'd always wanted). 
So now I have to deal with the fact that I'll probably have to leave my house,  find a place to myself,  start working while studying, and always have in mind that the woman who I call mom, who always neglected me will now have a perfect wife with her husband. And will probably make me take care of the child since they both work full-time jobs. 

I really don't know how to feel and had a major meltdown yesterday. 

Fyi. My dad does not have a stable job. So asking him to start taking care of my bills and stuff is out of question.

0,"AITA for making a sarcastic comment about an eating disorder? | To give a little background, I am a 34 year old woman who struggled with anorexia in my mid 20s. For several years, I lost a significant amount of weight by eating less than 1000 calories a day and exercising a ton. It was a coping mechanism to try to regain control after trauma. I eventually got help and I'm healthy now. 

When I was anorexic, I got nonstop compliments on my body. I didn't look like what people think someone who is anorexic looks like. Other than my sister and my best friend (who could tell something was wrong) people constantly talked about how perfect my body was, asked me for tips on weight loss, and complimented how ""disciplined"" I was with my eating. Even the person I was dating openly preferred my weight loss, even knowing it was due to an eating disorder. No one knew I had an eating disorder and we live in a society that's really messed up about food and bodies, so I don’t blame anyone for these comments (other than my ex, who did know).

To the present day - being anorexic in the past isn't something I hide or am shamed of. It's just part of my history. I talk about it openly, but obviously it doesn't come up often in conversation. It did come up recently with a group of friends that included a newer acquaintance. I made a sarcastic comment about all the compliments I got when I was anorexic (it sounds weird, but it made sense in the context of the conversation). I didn't think it was a big deal and no else seemed to either. There are no awkwardness or break in the conversation, but this newer acquaintance pulled me aside later in the night. She said she was uncomfortable with my joke and asked if it was a cry for help. I told her I was fine. I just have a dark sense of humor and was joking about how messed up our society is about weight and food. She then scolded me because she said I shouldn't joke about something so serious and that I was encouraging eating disorders by saying I got a lot of compliments then. I was totally taken aback and didn’t know what to say. 

On one hand, I feel like I was talking about my own experience and I'm allowed to talk about it however I want. And, to that point, I did get a lot of compliments! My comment was totally true. On the other hand, I definitely don't want to make light of eating disorders.

It's a cheap machine, the only upgrade is a solid state drive and I think I have less than $50 invested in the entire thing. Still, my wife and daughter don't take care of it and I think it's because they know it was ""cheap"". E.g. I insist that it should be turned off and put in the computer desk drawer when not in use. My wife leaves it running her game all day. Or if it's closed she leaves it on the table or where ever she was playing. Our cat jumped on it and now there is a horizontal band of lines about 1 inch tall from screen damage. If it were in the drawer it wouldn't be damaged. Also, the top is a nice blue color, is now covered in cat scratches. Her stepdad is gifting her his PC, a significant upgrade to ours in every regard, and I told her she is sharing that with our daughter and I'm wiping our laptop, fixing the screen and making it mine only.

A has anxiety. That's fine with me, I understand that its something that she can't help and that it impacts her daily life. However, A has done seemingly nothing to manage her anxiety on her own. Granted I don't know what she does in her personal time but if she is working on it, its not showing up in her interactions with me.

It wasn't that bad at first. I didn't mind it and I was okay with altering some of our interactions or going out of my way to make sure that she feels comfortable and everything, but its just gotten worse.

We are in a class together and A sends me pictures of EVERY single assignment to make sure it ""looks okay,"" because she has anxiety over sending it in.

She won't order her own food at a restraunt because she has anxiety over talking to the cashier. She won't ask for help in a store or for extra ketchup or whatever, every anxiety meme applies to her.

She dips last minute for plans EVERY time unless its something she has done at least 3 times before-- she dipped last minute from something I needed her to go to and she said she would three times, because it ""just gave her too much anxiety."" I have no problem with having to pass on something bc of that but tell me before 5 mins before the event!! This was after she spent 45 minutes grilling me on every single detail of where to go, what to wear, what to bring, what time to get there, what she needed to know, etc etc. When it was just a simple thing.

A makes me meet her outside of our club building every meeting because she is too anxious to walk in herself, even if I am in the middle of helping with something. She refuses to come in herself.

She won't do anything herself, she needs help/approval for everything or else she will either not do it at all or cry and blame it on her anxiety.

I know that I am being harsh. But I just didn't sign up to be her mom when I became her friend and it is frustrating me very much. I know that she can't help it, but maybe she should try getting some professional help? I am not trained to manage another person's anxiety!

1,"AITA for giving away our dog without my ex knowing? | I was in a relationship for 5 years and we broke up four months ago. He brought a dog into the relationship who was already 8 years old, but we decided to get another dog about a year ago.

When we split, we had to sit down and talk about the dogs. We decided he'd get the senior dog because it was before our relationship and I would keep the new dog. For what it's worth, we both paid into the new dog equally in terms of vet, food, as well as the dog itself.

I'm not a dog person but I tried to make it work. I loved both dogs. But due to my schedule for work and etc, I decided having a dog is not for me. So I gave the dog to a family member who was looking for a dog themselves. To note is the dog now lives some distance, not quite plane distance but definitely ""all day driving"" distance.

Why I might be the asshole is I didn't tell my ex until last week. By this point the dog has been gone a few weeks. He cried on the phone saying that it wasn't my place to give the dog away and he would have gladly *paid me* for the dog if it meant he'd get her back. But we decided it was my dog, I didn't need his permission or even his knowing. My family member wanted a dog and I was able to provide it.

0,"AITA for wanting my friend to fly solo? | So my two friends and I, let’s call them Joanne and Tina, really wanted to go on vacation abroad somewhere together. We decided it would be cheaper to volunteer, so we signed up with a program to go to somewhere in Europe for a week. We’re all so excited, we bought our tickets last week, everything seemed peachy.
This morning, however, Joanne texted the group chat that her father doesn’t want her to be in the Moscow airport for layover, because apparently they don’t treat Americans well or something. She asks Tina, who bought our $750 tickets and who put them all on her card, to see if she can get our layovers switched. Tina looked into it, and we can only get $104 back from our tickets. So we would have to spend at LEAST another $750 for a NEW set of tickets (probably more expensive for a different layover location). Joanne says it’s worth it because of our “safety”. Tina and I think this is total bullshit. All of us being 23 years old and holding entry level jobs, we’re not made of money. The three of us now have to meet at Tina’s house tomorrow night in order to discuss things over. Tina and I think that if Joanne wants to change layovers so much, SHE can buy another ticket and go a different flight by herself. Or if her father is so concerned for her safety, he should offer to pay for our tickets.

Am I the asshole for thinking it’s totally unreasonable to ask us to spend at least another $750 for a flight in a different layover location?

1,"WIBTA for selling a beautiful gift? | I am very outdoorsy and all of my hobbies include outdoor sports/adventure. My grandmother’s love language is gift giving. She asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I mentioned I’d love a rugged watch to wear while hiking, biking, kayaking, etc. something in the range of $50. She says ok, heard, and buys me an incredibly expensive luxury watch. It’s gorgeous, elegant, and...impractical. I fell all over my self thanking her at the time to make her feel loved and she seemed very pleased by that, but I’m a teacher of young kids and I’m worried the watch would get damaged at work. Furthermore, I cannot wear it during any of my hobbies and never go out to events where the watch would be an appropriate accessory. I also feel uncomfortable with such an expensive gift when I told her what I would like (she told me what she wanted and I stuck to it, if that matters)

My stepfather mentioned later that he knows the retail value of the watch and could sell it for me, then I could use the money to get something I could actually use and want.

0,"AiTA for asking for repayment after supporting everyone for 5 months? | 

  In September my partner was in an accident. A week later he came home and absolutely demanded I sell my car. He was extremely clear that it was to be sold. My car was definitely running but not in the best shape of its life. But I was still driving it. And I had been going back and forth about weather I wanted to sell or fix. I was currently on wanting to fix, even going as far as asking him how hard it would be to fix ourselves, watching a few videos about it, and looking at prices for parts. He was aware of my feelings, I involved him totally.

  Well exactly one day after selling my beloved car he comes home and tells me hes not able to work anymore as hes in too much pain. I wasnt aware he was in that much pain as he made no effort to get looked at prior to this convo. Hes said hes been in similar pain for years and made no effort to get checked out before all this despite having excellent health coverage. He only says hes in more pain. I found it odd that it was so conveniently after I've just received quite a bit of money for my car. But I did not mention my feeling about that at the time, but I have now. But he promised that I could just get another car. 

  But as time went on and I tried to actually get another car, he shot down every car I suggested. Right from a decent used car from a dealership to craigslist and facebook jalopies. All this is happening while I'm slowly depleting the money I have for another car by supporting our household because I dont make enough to support everyone on my paycheck alone. Before this all happened the expenses were split pretty 50/50. Hes always known that I couldnt support us all by myself. So in theory it'd have been very bad for him to be out of work. Had I not sold my car.

  Now that he's ready to rejoin the workforce and received his lost wages for the last 5 months, we've been talking about all the late bills we'll need to catch up on. And another car. Because now he needs the car we do have. While I'm left out in the literal cold to bum rides home from work and uber, which is further depleting my savings. 

  So when I asked if we'd be getting me another car, he blew up. He was even calling me mean names. After awhile I couldnt take the mindfuck anymore and started calling him names back, I do admit. He said I'm being greedy for asking and I should just save up on my own if I want another car. How I was the one that had wanted to sell my car. He started saying if I wanted I could have gotten another car anytime I wanted. He said me showing him cars that were in my price range never happened. And that I'm constantly treating him like shit for asking him to take some of the stress off me by trying to make money anyway he could or doing chores around the house.

1,"AITA for expecting my wife to pursue a career that pays well? | When I met my wife, she was pursuing a career as a stand-up comedian. She was constantly going to open mics, writing, and doing shows. She was given a highly sought after but unpaid position at our city's biggest comedy club opening for the touring headlining comic. At the time she was making 2-3k year with comedy and had no other income other than child support from an ex. She wasn't making much money but was ambitious and we loved each other, and my 60k job was enough to get us by so we got married.  After that she cut back on her writing/performing and took time to be 'happy.' After a year or so of this I asked her if she really wanted to be a comedian, she said yes, and I proposed a 6 month period to get her comedy career back on track and on a trajectory to make a full time adult income. If that didn't work, she would pursue another more predictably successful career. She agreed and kept track of hours spent on comedy. It was 14hrs/week during that period and she hadn't achieved the needed success so comedy was turned into a hobby and do a new career it was.

She wanted to go to school to become an on-air radio personality. I shot it down b/c its another profession where there are a handful of people making enough to pay a mortgage and endless people trying to get that job and making no money. She gave me a lot of flak for this. She wanted to respond to a craigslist ad for a 26k receptionist job, but as a very intelligent woman with a BA in journalism, I knew she was capable of establishing herself in a career that would eventually pay at least 50k and set that as a minimum salary for careers to consider. She says that that is insane, and that no reasonable person would ever put an actual number, especially one so ludicrously high on an expected salary from their spouse and that before we were married, I never let her know I would have this expectation.

0,"WIBTA if I asked my neighbor's gardeners to stop parking in my driveway? | I feel like this could be a potential ""Get Off My Lawn"" situation and I really don't want to be that person. So, WIBTA if I did?

My neighbor's gardeners come a couple times a week. They stay for about 4 hours, and for at least part of that time, they park in my driveway to unload their equipment, unload plants, mulch, etc. I'd say it's about an hour, sometimes two, each time they visit. This has been going on for a couple of years. I understand why they do it - the access to her backyard is easier from my driveway, parking in hers means walking along the front of her house to move stuff to the back. Parking in front of her house is not always available, but I notice even when it is, they still park in my driveway.

I work from home, and my desk looks out over the driveway, so I typically sit there, slightly annoyed but not seething, while they hang out. Dude was sitting there in my driveway in his truck, with motor running, eating lunch the other day. Today I was coming home and had to track down a guy to move the truck so I could pull up to my garage.

It probably wouldn't bother me so much, but lots of cars/trucks use my driveway to turn around, or block my driveway to deliver packages, etc. It's a particularly wide and convenient place to block. I'm honestly not overstating that, and that doesn't bother me because I understand and expect that. But I don't expect someone to hang there for an hour or so.

0,"WIBTA for not wanting my flatmate in the new house? | I, my husband (Dylan), and my roommate (Hayley) met in college. Dylan and Hayley were dorm-mates, and she was my freshman buddy who kept me alive, so we were all more or less tight-knit.

&#x200B;

My mom kicked me out of the house that year, and I had nowhere else to go. Dylan and I decide to get that apartment we've been planning for awhile, but we need a third roommate. Hayley volunteers, we're all set, they can have their cats since it's off-campus, I'm not homeless anymore. I figured out Hayley is a cool friend, but a sucky roommate. The more notable events/points:

&#x200B;

\- Complained she didn't like certain chores (she gagged while doing them). NBD, we all just switch chores. Wouldn't do the ones she picked. Rolls her eyes and sighs when asked. I'm on bedrest with severe illness, and The mess gets so bad even Dylan can't pick up the slack.

&#x200B;

\- If her family (well-to-do, lil bit judge-y) come over, everything has to be super clean, right then. Maybe I should've left the mess to see what happened.

&#x200B;

\- Brought kittens into the house from her crush. Barn cats, had fleas. Months-long, costly infestation that thank God didn't spread to the neighbors. She blamed our bathed, treated, collared cat and not help us until locking the cats out of her bedroom won't save her from the fleas.

&#x200B;

Things got worse when she found a boyfriend in one of my and Dylan's friends and spent all her time with his. I asked her to drop me off at the ER (not even stay, just drop me at the door, I explained this), and she pulled a face, saying she would, but she didn't know how to tell her boyfriend she'd be late to come stay with him for the weekend. I told her it was fine, ended up having to call Dylan at work to come take me. I was pretty upset about it, actually, but that could have been the pain I was in. Kidney stones fucking suck.

&#x200B;

She's gotten a lot worse about the chores since then, and I can't talk to her about them without her boyfriend puffing up and trying to interfere, since she's his gf now and can do no wrong (I'm serious, he's not the chum I knew before this). She started to spend more time at his house, only coming by for the key (she lost hers) to go into the apartment to drink, and I suppose do couple things. Then she stopped coming by altogether. It's like she doesn't live here anymore, except she pays her part of rent. Her cat is still here, pretty much ours now.

&#x200B;

So here's where I might BTA. You're a saint for sticking with it this far.

&#x200B;

Dylan and I found a house. It practically fell in our laps--affordable payments and everything we'd want in a starter home. Hayley knew about it before she found her boyfriend, and of course we figured she'd move in with us if it happened. Now she fully expects she and her boyfriend will move in.

&#x200B;

I don't want her to anymore. This has been exhausting. Her boyfriend doesn't work. She couldn't even help when we were putting in long hours to qualify for the house.

0,"WIBTA for calling animal control on my neighbors because they let their dog roam all over the place off their property? | Hear me out. My front door neighbors have several acres of farmland and currently have a [Cane Corso](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/CaneCorso_%2823%29.jpg) breed dog. This dog isn't aggressive or mean but they don't keep him on a lead and haven't taught him to stay close to the house. He just wanders wherever he wants around the small street I live on. The issue is that he tries to chase native wildlife like squirrels and birds and will go into other people's yards to do it (like my yard because I have lots of birdhouses and feeders), and he thinks running into the road barking at motorcycles and big trucks is a fun hobby. He also leaves massive shits everywhere. 

I've asked my neighbors multiple times over the 3 years they've had him to please control their dog and teach him to stay close. They say sorry and nothing changes. I've personally witnessed this dog almost get ran over because he loves running into traffic multiple times. 

Several years ago they had another dog, a great Dane, who did the same behavior as this dog (running everywhere, chasing cars, not being aggressive but generally a nuisance) and I also asked them to control the dog because I was worried he was going to get hit. Well, one night I was smoking on my porch and I heard horn honks, brakes squeal, and dog scream. Dog got ran over and died because he was playing chicken with a truck in the dark. And yet they continue to allow their new dog to act the SAME WAY THAT GOT THEIR OTHER DOG KILLED.


I'm really sick of this. I do not want this poor dog to be hit by a car. The shitting and the chasing I can live with if I have to, he's a dog, that's doggy behavior whatever. But seriously. Hearing that dog get hit by that truck was fucking traumatizing to me as a huge dog lover and every day I see that dog out there I'm terrified it's going to happen again. My boyfriend says it's a dick move to call animal control because it's not my dog and if my neighbors are stupid enough to let their animal run around untrained well that's on them. But I don't want this dog to get hurt because its owned by ignoramuses.

TL:DR Lyft driver creeped me out by continuously hitting on me even after I told them I had a BF and politely asked them to stop. 

So I (24f) live in a rather large metropolitan area I don't drive for a variety of reasons so I use lyft  or the public transportation system in my area to get around. This afternoon When I was getting off of work I ordered a lyft for my commute home. Right off the bat this guy starts making me uncomfortable when I get into the car. I wore a pencil skirt to work and my driver Ted (40m) reached up and adjusted his rearview mirror that from my POV looked like he was staring at me. I tried to brush it off though assuming maybe it was just the angle of the mirror that was giving me a false perspective. 

That was at least until he started making comments the gist of which was, I love a woman in a skirt and high heels, lucky me for getting your request normally I don't have such interesting women in my car, what size of shoe do you wear? He even mentioned how he was a lyft  driver full time to support himself and his children. And that I wouldn't believe the type of people he go as rides to. I literally couldn't believe what I was hearing, I mean who says or does that? So I politely say thank you for the compliments but I have a BF and even if I didn't he was way too old for me. He brushed my comments aside and kept at it saying things like being older just makes him more experienced. And that he wasn't trying to be offensive, he was just complimenting me. I

After 15 minutes of this we finally arrive at my apartment complex and I bolt out of the car and shouts after me if he can get my number. I'm quite freaked out by all of this quite frankly. My BF thinks I should report him but some are saying I should let it go because it's unlikely I will see him again and maybe he was just socially awkward when it comes to flirting. Especially considering he uses it full time to support himself and his family.

Last Wednesday, our company said you had the option to work from home until things calm down WITH the understanding that people have to be doing actual work. The problem is that half of our employees are not set-up to work from home and working from home was more for the people on the east coast. 

Our staff do not have a VPN and some don't even have a computer at home. There is no way they can work from home. No one thought that anyone at our office would work from home unless they had the capabilities to do so (it's being worked on so that people can work from home). So of course, the very same people who have no capabilities to get work done were the ones who decided to ""work"" from home last week.

We told her where we were from the Midwest, and she was even more excited and said Midwestern people are so friendly and she hopes to establish a relationship with us in which we can just go over to each other‘s house and chat every day. 

Well she legitimately was coming over every day knocking on the door anytime from the morning to the afternoon to the evening and just wanted to talk on and on. She’s a very awkward conversationalist . Several times we had the cable person or water heater person over as we had just moved in, and she would always come over either during or right after their visit to find out who it was and what was going on. When we had a group of our friends over (nothing loud or obnoxious) she came over and asked what was going on. We just said we are hanging out with friends and introduced them to her. She pointed to my one friend (who happens to be a POC) and said “you look like the troublemaker of the group!“ 😬

So I just assumed she must have something troubling in her past.” I had said nothing of the sort. 

Well this was the last straw for me and I texted her that she was not allowed to come over unannounced anymore unless we invited her over for coffee or dinner or something.

He told my husband that he had heard that I was not friendly at all and he said “so I’ve been told by her not to interact with either of you because you are mean!” (Which why is he telling my husband this?!)

Anyway because he lives with me and I usually do the grocery stuff I’ve started to buy more healthy shit like olive oil vs butter and eggs and turkey bacon etc. Nuts and seeds and no more weed cuz that gives him a free pass to eat like a m’fer.

I always get there with enough time because I hate being late - and even then I only made it inside the room a couple minutes before the movie started.

So the place is almost full and I'm on the right corner all alone. Then comes this guy and starts talking to me. Convo went like this: 

- ""Hey, are you alone?""

- ""Yeah, I am"" 

- ""Well, I came here with my friend but the place is full, we couldn't get tickets to sit together so would you mind going to my seat so that I can sit here with him?""

- ""Sure! No problem""

- ""Okay, my seat is that way""

At that point he's pointing to the far left of the room. Meanwhile, the last commercial is playing and the movie is about to start in 10 seconds (I know cause I had already seen the film and I knew it was the very last one). Since I was in the far right this would require me to take my stuff, get out of the room, go that way, check what number/row the ticket is for, go there and sit down. There's absolutely *no way* I can do that in 10 seconds because the room is big, people are still going in and I don't want to miss a thing. So I tell him:

- ""Sorry but the movie is about to start. If you had come here with more time and your seat was nearby then sure, I would move, but it's too late now""

He proceeded to stare at me, complain to his friend that 'I wouldn't move' (said in a disgusting voice as if I was some sort of evil witch or something) and went out of the room so that he could go to his seat. As he was talking to his friend the movie started so by the time he went out and came back in I'm pretty sure he missed two or three lines.

She would also make fun of my hair and clothes and say I was going to die a virgin and stuff like that, and that my only friends were the anime characters I would draw (ok I did have a little bit of an anime phase but I didn’t like go over the top and do the Naruto run or anything and I got over it pretty quick, I just appreciated the artwork and still do). She also interrupted me while I was asking a girl to the prom and told her she could do better. Just dumb shit like that. 

It didn’t scar me for life or anything but she definitely made me feel like shit about myself a lot of the time and luckily I pretty much forgot about her once we all graduated and went off to college. I know she might have changed but I just don’t see myself working with and managing someone who was so rude to me all the time. 

And as tempting as it would be to have her come in and lord it over her during the interview that I’m not gonna hire her, I won’t do that because that’s petty and unprofessional. Really I just want to call her and tell her the position is filled so not to come in for an interview. But now I’m wondering if that would be shitty of me, maybe she has in fact changed and needs this job to support her family or something. What do you guys think?",False,False

Then, he goes ahead and pours bleach while her clothes were washing. I'm truly bewildered on why either of then will do that.

I was delighted to pull it off, as I'm a big r/peeling fan and derive great satisfaction from it. I turned to her and said, ""You know you were supposed to take this off, right?"" She looked upset and whined that she was waiting to take it off herself. I laughed pretty hard, because the idea of her ""saving"" her TV to pull the initial packaging screen off, for most of it's product life, is pretty hilarious and bizarre to me. She continued whining for minutes though and called me an asshole. I only stayed for about ten more minutes because she was being a grouch and wouldn't snap out of it.

She complained that she is bored so after i went home and rested a bit i called her and she didn't pick up. Hours later she texted me since I couldn't make it she called her ex lets call him David and she is drinking with him. She just send some drunk voice mails and  kept ignoring me whole night.

She knows that I don't want her to spend time with him especially alone. Every time she says he is gay and has a bf and they just went out for a couple months in high school it meant nothing and he is just a best friend to him. Even though I do not like this I allow her to see him with their other friends around.

So when she texted like nothing had happened I told her she knew I don't want her ex to be involved in our life and instead of apologizing she told me she wish she never told me they dated and and that I am controlling her friendships. When I stand my ground and told I can't allow this she just offered me to hangout with David more and see what kind of person he is and how he is like a brother. When I asked her if she ever kissed her brother she got offended and now she is acting like she is hurt.

So my parents met each other a few months before I was made. They decided to stick together because of me, so they moved in together. Of course, I dont remember this, but the first years of my life would be filled with financial problems. 

They have been together all my life, and have had ups and downs. The past year or so has been a MAJOR down. Again, not gonna get too specific but basically they're tired of each other. They have mentioned divorce several times (usually outside of arguments) but nothing has changed. The problem is, my mom has no where to go. 

They have asked me several times what I think, and I always say, ""I just want you guys to be happy."" Now while that is true, I havent said what I really think. What I really think is that they should get divorced. WIBTA if I said that, or should I just continue to say that I want them to be happy?

0,"AITA for asking my GF to wear shoes to breakfast? | AITA. Me (23M) and my girlfriend (23F) went on our first holiday together. Unfortunately, we had a small argument regarding wearing shoes to the breakfast buffet at the hotel.

It all started as we were leaving our room to go to the breakfast restaurant and I noticed she was not wearing any shoes. I asked her to put some on.

She refused, claiming that nobody else cares if she wears or doesn't wear shoes. Obviously, she got more frustrated by me demanding that she do something (we are both pretty stubborn people).

I find that going to a breakfast restaurant without any shoes (just socks) quite disrespectful to the property, to the staff and to the other clients. The establishment has made an effort to keep the breakfast lounge clean, replenish food/drink and waiter for us; I feel the least we can do is come fully dressed. I also feel like it brings unwarranted attention to her (and to me), which I really don't like.

Her argument is that I am being silly and it's perfectly reasonable to go without shoes to the buffet. She suggested I was being too 'posh'. My girlfriend also doesn't think that anyone will notice or care enough, if they do notice. But I beg to differ. 

The argument escalated to the point we're I decided I rather not go down to breakfast and I will just eat some of the snacks we bought from the supermarket the day before. I don't really get angry, and wouldn't let this ruin our holiday. Basically, I didnt  hold a grudge for missing breakfast and continued the day as if it hadn't happened.

This is all in the past and we are doing very well right now. But this was a small blip in our relationship and I wanted a second opinion, do I need to get over myself? Is it a bit odd to go to a restaurant shoeless?

0,"AITA; my partner accidentally forwarded me my Christmas gift and he found out that I hated it. | Hey Reddit. Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

&#x200B;

My partner and I have been together for 1.5 years. We get along really well and have had a really good month, until last night. I was working afternoon shift at work when I got an email, and it was from him. He has accidentally sent me my xmas gift, which is a *skydiving* voucher. I have never, once, expressed that I would like to go skydiving. The voucher is for me only, so i'd be going skydiving alone. The thought of having to do this is terrifying. I had to leave my position at work because I was feeling really anxious about having to go skydiving. I couldn't think of anything worse than doing it alone. 

&#x200B;

I then got really upset because I didn't know if I could do it, mentally. I didn't think I could just book it in and go and do it. It's not something i'd do, I  think it would cause my anxiety to flare up. Then I got even more anxious because he's going to think i'm super ungrateful and selfish if I say anything about it. Then he texts me, really upset because he's realised he's forwarded me my xmas gift and tells me to just forget about it.

&#x200B;

My shift ends, I go home. I felt really bad about going home because I knew I needed to be honest and say to him I didn't know if I could do it. I got home, tried my best to say it nicely that I really didn't know if I could do it and theres no need to buy me any other gifts because he spent $300 on this damn voucher. No refunds either. As expected, he got really angry and upset, called me ungrateful and selfish. He told me it was unreasonable and not the ""meaning of christmas"" to get things that I wanted or asked for, but I should be happy that people thought of what to get me. I was really upset this whole time, obviously.

0,"WIBTA for cutting off a friend because I can't deal with her mental illness? | Alt bc I'm pretty sure she knows my main. 

I've been friends with this girl we'll call Mia for about two years now. We've never been super close by any stretch of the imagination, but we've certainly been in the same friendship group. To be honest I've always found her...a lot. She's the type of person who will post on Facebook about feeling miserable and then say she doesn't want to talk about it when people ask. 

Anyway, about six months ago Mia and I discovered that we both suffer from the same mental health condition. I won't get specific so as not to reveal too many identifying details, but it's a pretty shitty condition which comes with a whole host of pretty intense symptoms. I went through hell with it in years past, but am dealing much better now. I believed she was too, and told her if she did ever wanna talk with someone who knew she could talk to me. She told me the same. 

Honestly, I regret telling her this. It feels like every day she's calling me with some new problem, usually crying on the phone for up to an hour. I get that our condition can make tiny things seem like catastrophes but the things she calls me and cries about are varied and endless. Anything from a fight with her parents, with whom she has a horrible relationship, to the supermarket having no milk left so she can't have any tea tonight. I feel like this would take a lot of energy and be draining even for a neurotypical person. With my condition, it's downright exhausting. Especially given she more often than not ghosts me if I try to talk to her about my own issues bc she doesn't have the energy to help me out that day. 

So here's my situation. I've tried talking to Mia about maybe switching therapists/getting more therapy (I've used her current therapist myself in the past and honestly he's not great), but she insists this is working for her. She doesn't like to take medication, which I believe would help, but okay that's her decision. Point is, she doesn't really seem to be making any proactive steps to improve and I don't know if I can handle her at full-tilt any more. The issue is I'm kinda the only person apart from her therapist she can really talk to about mental health things. None of our other friends have the condition so, while sympathetic, can only help so much. As I mentioned she has a shitty relationship with her family and can't really talk to them about it. If I cut her off, I'm essentially taking away her one outlet in order to save my own mental health. I just feel like that's disgustingly selfish, and idk if it's worth it.

0,"WIBTA - for asking my friend to pay for ‘my’ speeding ticket? | I got a $400 speeding ticket from DC in the mail today. When I checked the date and time on the ticket, it was from the day my friend was driving my car.

-I was in the front passenger seat but not paying attention to the speed limit signs
-We could have easily taken his car but my car has better air conditioning and ‘is fun to drive’ (his words)
-Clocked at 64 mph in a 40 mph Work Zone

In general I think he is a good driver which is why I trusted him to drive my car and he was doing me favor by driving. I don’t think it would have happened if we took his car (my car is easier to speed in) or if I drove.

I understand ultimately I’m responsible for the ticket because it’s my car. But I feel since he was driving he should carry some or all of this price.

0,"AITA for changing my Friendsgiving potluck dish because everyone else did? | Seven of us planned this Friendsgiving together over the course of the last month, pitching together what we would all be making. We all agreed that I would take on the main dish, the beef wellington, since I have made it successfully before and everyone's been wanting to try it. I had absolutely no issues at all at this point in time since everyone else's dishes sounded great as well.

Eventually, as we drew nearer to the date, everyone had changed from their original dishes to something else. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but their changes have all been to something of significantly reduced quality. This is what it came down to before I finally made my change:

* Friend 1: Maple bacon cornbread => Nothing, will pitch in $ to whoever makes it for him (no one offered so I took the offer) + will bring beers. Reason: Has to take his nieces out before the dinner and has no time to make it
* Friend 2: Chicken tikka masala mashed potatoes => regular mashed potatoes. Reason: Didn't have the tikka masala ingredients and didn't want to go buy it.
* Friend 3: Homemade pumpkin pie => Grocery store pie. Reason: Her oven doesn't work
* Friend 4: Pesto Pasta Salad => Regular salad, asked if I had ranch in my fridge. Reason: She messed up the pesto
* Friend 5: Home cured duck prosciutto with some other charcuterie meats and cheeses  => Just the store bought meats and cheeses. Reason: He accidentally ate too much of the duck prosciutto and is saving what's left for his family's Thanksgiving dinner
* Friend 6: Lobster mac and cheese => Nothing. Couldn't make it anymore

After all this, I was less compelled to make my beef wellington since it's a lot of time/work/money to make it in comparison to everything else, plus I now had to make the cornbread. I told the group that I was no longer making the wellington and that I would just make a roasted duck instead and no one was happy. Some discussed just cancelling the dinner since it's a shell of our original plan, some suggested we just go out to a restaurant, others called me out for being spiteful.

Some other info: 2 of us (including me) changed our dishes today and the dinner is tomorrow. The rest changed theirs over the course of this past week.

1,"AITA for eating one of my sister’s lactose-free snacks? | So, for background, my sister [19F] is lactose intolerant. We only found out recently and she’s the only one in the family. She normally lives in another city for university but she had to come back to live with my mother and I [16M] due to recent events.

My mother buys separate snacks for my sister since the “normal” ones all have lactose. The lactose-free ones still taste good but they cost a lot more so my mother also buys the normal ones so that she doesn’t have to buy more of the lactose-free ones. So, basically, only my sister eats the lactose-free ones.

I suspect that my sister still eats some of the normal snacks since they have been eaten a lot more quickly ever since she moved back in and my sister does still complain about the intestinal problems that led to us finding out she's lactose intolerant.

So, the other morning, I got up to have breakfast and noticed that there were no normal snacks left. What I did notice is there were still two lactose-free snacks left. 

I don’t normally eat the lactose-free snacks because it feels wrong since they were bought for my sister. My mother has never explicitly said not to eat them, but since my sister theoretically can’t eat the others, I don’t want to eat the lactose-free snacks since we have less of them. But there were two and I knew that we’d buy food that day and get more. So I figured that if I ate one, she would definitely still have one for herself if she hadn’t had breakfast yet and she’d get more later on, anyway. So I decided to just eat one.

I didn’t think much about it until later on in the day my sister noticed and got really angry at me for eating her food. I explained that I didn’t think it was wrong because it was one of the few things left and I didn’t finish the snacks, but she said it’s wrong in the first place for me to eat her food because she can’t eat the other.

I think I acted wrong afterwards because at that point I got angry at her and told her that it didn’t matter because she ate the normal snacks anyway and it was her fault that they had finished when they were supposed to last us longer. She then said that it wasn’t true and that I was lying, and I suppose it’s true that mine is just an assumption and I don’t really know. But I think that my point about not finishing the snacks still stands.

Now she’s still angry at me and my mother told me I should just apologise to her so that the fight ends but I don’t think it’s fair because I don’t feel I did anything wrong. I think maybe I think she’s the one who should apologise to me for getting mad at me over eating a snack. My mother even said that all the food is for everyone in the house and neither of us should get mad at the other for eating any of it when we’re hungry. Am I really TA in this situation? I think maybe I shouldn't have accused her but she's the one who shouted at me in the first place.",False,False

 When I asked her why she doesnt want to eat these foods she states that that's all she ate when she grew up and she's sick of it but I also grew up eating the same thing (I know this since we share the same culture) and I'm not sick of it.

I wouldn't mind cooking other things but she never seems to know what she wants me to cook so I'm left looking for recipes that she might like and having to learn how to make them.

My niece who lives a 15 hour drive away is turning one. My sister has brought my niece to my home state 3 or 4 times since she was born, but my wife and I have yet to make it to their house. When my sister was planning her birthday I talked about it with my wife (who had recently found out shes pregnant) about the situation and we agreed I would take the trip alone for a long weekend to represent the both of us.

Now that the day is approaching my wife is getting extremely anxious and nervous about me leaving. We lost our first pregnancy at 12 weeks, which I'm sure is adding to her anxiety, but she is currently 26 weeks pregnant with twins and everything is looking great.

My wife keeps telling me it's fine she'll be ok and go and have a good time, but her body language and tears have said different. She has her family that lives 10 minutes from us so I asked her mom to keep her company and stay over if need be. My MIL is on board and told me to go, enjoy myself and my wife will be fine.

He's some industry guru who made a lot of money in web programming and he let us know that right off the bat.

The problem with J is that he spends the who lecture time trying to be ""hip"" and impress us by being funny and making ""radical"" comments. He starts each lecture by pulling a desk to the front, taking his shoes off, and connecting with us. He then proceeds to just stand there and ramble about stuff that is vaguely related to the topic while not teaching us anything. Wednesday he spent over 25 minutes letting us philosophies on how we should layout a web page despite the fact he hasn't taught a single html tag in class.

&#x200B;

The worst part by far though is the work load. For the next 14 days we have various small irrelevant things due and almost 4 chapters of reading. Despite being a web programming class, tonight we have to write a page paper pretending to ""advertise"" our website. The thing that pissed me off though is that he never announced any of this in class or though the announcement channel. Last night we had our first reading and first project due (4th day of the semester). We had to build a simple site in html despite the fact he never announced that 2 chapters of the book were due or the project in class. This morning when we came people were complaining and he told them ""tough luck"" and to pay closer attention to the due dates.

As class was getting started people were still complaining so he announced that he would reopen it for tonight but I raised my hand and told him that it still does not make it right because he has yet to teach us anything about html. He then told me that it's my responsibility to read and learn and that he wont be repeating what's said in the book because that is ""not his job"". He then said that the book will teach us and we are supposed to come to class with that knowledge.

Most of the kids in this class are freshman with only 3 or 4 seniors like myself filling the credit requirements.

Fast forward no less than 5/6 months when I get a notification on my phone from that mutual friend asking if I was free that weekend to go out. I was taken aback since we hadn't talked in forever but I agreed.

We get there and after some small talk she ""confesses"" that she wanted to go get dinner with me because I'm a great listener and seem like a level headed person.This wasn't the first time I heard that, but I was still wondering what she had to tell basically a random stranger to whom she talked to once.

Then she goes off : apparently she hadn't contacted me in months because her bf did not allow her to make new friends, especially dudes. They were on a break now which is why she, and I quote, ""Had the nerve to go out alone with a boy"". I was shocked.She goes on to say he constantly hurt her physically, emotionally toyed with her, threatened her,broke things in her home, would not let her go out, etc. I explained how she was in a VERY dangerous relationship and that she did the right thing by leaving him.

Then she said in very sad tone ""Doesn't matter , I love him and we'll be back together soon"".Her situation was deplorable: she knew what kind of a relationship she had, however she was convinced by him that he was all she needed and ever will deserve. I tried talking her into going to the police , or her family. She bluntly refused and told me she just wanted to talk to someone, that being me, but not doing anything about it.

I didn't personally knew the guy, I had buddies who did.I asked her if she was ok with me talking to him about all of this to which she firmly said ""no"". She told me how he has HUGE anger management issues and that he'd beat me. First of all, it wouldn't have got to that, and second, even if it did and I had to defend myself I'd have no problems (The guy was an absolute joke). After a bit more of her telling me what an ass the guy was, telling me about his threats of hurting her if she didn't act as he wanted, we both went home. I tried contacting her to see how she was doing after about 1 week and I received a text telling me they're back together and that she HAS to block me.

We used to host huge Christmas parties, and go ALL OUT with lights. Every room had lights, every inch of the house was decorated. It was a huge family tradition. When I turned 12 I started helping put up said lights. 

This whole thing started when I found out SM didn’t like Christmas. We aren’t religious, and she is. She resisted putting up ANY lights, but GF managed to get her to bend enough for us to put up about half of what we usually do. She however would not allow a Christmas party. 

Tradition in my family is the “kids” (20 and under) get to open one gift of their choosing the day before Xmas eve, and then we do dinner and gifts on Xmas eve itself. My mum and siblings drove all the way from flordia to Ohio to participate in Christmas this year.

However, SM has insisted nobody can open any gifts until Xmas day. When told that’s never been how it’s done, she said “well it’s how it’s done now”. When I confronted my grandfather, he said the same thing, because he’s scared of disagreeing with SM.

SM also insists my dog (a 12 lbs poodle) be kept confined in a single room at all times (at all points in the year) so her cats can have free roam of the entire house. When my mum came, bringing her own tiny 5 lbs dog, Sm also insisted that dog be kept in the Same already small room with MY dog, who is not especially dog-friendly, as she’s never been properly socialized. 

Her “vegan daughter” is meant to come to Xmas dinner, however that means everything will be catered to her daughter. Nothing will be meat, or plant based. And you aren’t allowed to bring in food from other places if you aren’t a big fan of vegan food. You either eat vegan, or don’t eat at all, because the daughter is there.

Everyone is miserable. I keep hearing my brother say he wants to leave before Christmas, my mum hates it here, and my sister is angry about the change in tradition. 

Am I the asshole for firmly believing my step-grandmother ruined our christmas?",False,False
1,"AITA for aging a picture of one of my friend on one of those face aging apps. | Ok so my best friend and I like to mess with each other on snap and edit each others pictures, so I decided to try one of those face aging apps to mess with her. I made her look like a 90 year old woman with a beard and thought shed laugh. Frankly I saw no harm in it, I didn't post it I didn't even send it to anyone else but her and its a selfie she sent me before that I used. But when she received it she flipped out saying I shouldn't use pictures of her on other apps without her permission. And yeah I see why that might bother people so I apologized and told her I wouldn't do it again but she told me I was an inconsiderate asshole and not to talk to her again. I feel like she over reacted but I feel kinda bad, am I wrong here?",False,False
0,"AITA for lying to my father | So, a little background.

My father is extremly controling and even though i'm 18 i still have to ask permission for nearly everything, including if i can go to the store or literally just across the yard to my neighbor's. His controling behavior didn't really bother me that much when i was younger because i was extremly introverted and didn't have friends at all, but in the last 2-3 years i met some incredible people who i'm lucky to call my friends and i changed as a person i became more talkative and more confident, however i started wishing i'd spent more time with them especially because some of them don't even go to the same school as me and i dont get to see them at all.

And thats how te problem was created I would ask my father if i can go hang out with my friends and he wouldn't let me, mind you these were reasonable requests i would ask to go hang out with them at 3pm and i would promise to be back by 6pm but he still wouldn't let me, my friends arent a bad company either none of them do drugs, they don't smoke and they don't even consume alcohol frequently, etc. So in order to spend more time with them i started lying i would say im going to the library but wouldn't tell im also meeting with a friend, or i would say im going on a ride with my motorcycle and i would park at my boyfriend's house and hang out with him, just stuff like that. I would do this maybe once or twice on a good week.

As you may already guessed it my father found out, there was a lot of screaming in the house, i got banned from going anywhere except to school and back home, i got called names, etc.

I know i shouldn't lie to him but i kinda just wanted a bit of social life and i really used this as my last plan. I tried talking to him multiple times throughout the course of 3 years but it never worked. My mind is a mess right now because i know i'm an asshole for lying to him but then again i just wanted some social life like any other teenager and talking to him never worked. I don't know what do you all think?",False,False
0,"AITA for dismissing guy in my class? | AITA. So a guy in my class (community college) immediately attached himself to me. I was a bit surprised but open to making a new friend. However during that first class he talked constantly and made Some slightly rude comments about the teacher so I decided to sit elsewhere in the future. When he saw that I didn’t sit next to him he moved his things to be near me. This happened several times.

After only knowing him for about 4 days he made ‘jokes’ about torture and how it’s always the people who seem nice that turn out to be violent. This multiplied my discomfort. I now sit at a full table closest to the professor and he still comes to talk to me almost every day and thankfully hasn’t said anything else about violence since. I always answer when he talks to me but don’t really encourage further conversation.

After some more observation I realized that he most likely has some form of autism and can’t really help his bad social interactions. Part of me feels bad like I should try to engage more because no one else in class talks to him and he has kind of chosen me to be his friend . And the other part of me (most of me) just really wants to get away. 
AITA for dismissing someone who probably just really wants friends?",False,False
0,"AITA For refusing to let my Uncle and Aunt borrow my car during their visit? | My Uncle and Aunt visited me in the US last week, and now I'm being branded by them as a selfish asshole. I (25 Male) am a big car guy and as a result, both the vehicles I own are expensive performance cars ( '17 C63 AMG S and '18 Ghibli SQ4 for you car junkies out there) . As a result, I never let anyone who isn't directly under my insurance drive them ( Only my parents and GF ever drive them). In addition, I have around a total of 25k in modifications done to the cars, so I stand to lose that money in the unfortunate event that either car were to be damaged or totaled. Basically, they ended up coming for a short 2 week trip. They decided to use my house as a hub and travel around, which I didn't mind at all. When we discussed their plans for the 2 weeks, it became apparent that they would do a lot of long distance driving ( \~2000 miles total) . I made sure they were aware that I would not be willing to let them use either car for their trip as they have had a history of not respecting other people's cars ( They filled regular gas in my dad's car before when it requires premium and brushed it off like it was no big deal). Things seemed fine and they booked a rental car, which I got them a huge discount on ( Worked out to an average of 32 bucks a day for a Small SUV) . They are not poor by any means btw, together making around 200k. The trip seemed fine, until after they returned home. My parents told me that apparently they were upset and have been bitching about me being a selfish asshole for forcing them to rent a car despite having two cars. I have an extended family of about 45 people and apparently a good chunk of them have had an earful about this 'act of selfishness' on my part. My aunt and uncle even went as far as to say that I should have considered family members needing to borrow my car before buying such an expensive car. Unfortunately, while my Mom isn't siding with them, she is upset at me for not letting them borrow one of my cars. She says its not a big deal and that nothing would have happened, and even if something would have happened, I could just ' claim insurance'. My dad, however, understands my point of view and says theres nothing selfish about what I have done. I'm so conflicted. Have any of you been in a similar situation? ",False,False
1,"AITA for telling my son the truth about alcohol? | Ok bear with me. My wife and I have a 6 year old son, Alex. He’s very smart and curious and I encourage that by not sugarcoating things. He asks questions, I give him answers. I can’t stand when adults use baby talk or kid language.

Anyway, today I was watching TV and downing a few beers. My son asked me if he could try some. I said no. He asked why, and I said “because beer is an adult drink.”

He asked why. Now my wife and her family normally say things like “that’s Daddy’s juice” or “Mommy’s juice” if it’s wine. I think that’s stupid.

So I said “because beer makes you feel funny and then it makes you puke.” My son doesn’t like throwing up so I figured this would turn him off.

He asked why I drink beer if it makes you puke.

I said well grownups drink beer because when you get older, life is really hard and sad. Beer makes you happy and makes you forget about your problems. Beer makes you stop thinking because you have so many bad thoughts.

My son just kind of said “OK” and went away at that point. My wife overheard that last part and is PISSED, says it wasn’t age appropriate. I think I told him the truth and I wasn’t overly graphic.

0,"AITA for not wanting to baptize my baby? | TLDR at the end. Mobile so sorry if anything looks weird.

My fiance and I both agreed we didn't plan on baptizing our baby. My parents are pretty pissed about this, especially my dad, and started an argument with me over it.

They asked why we weren't getting her baptized and I said it's because we're not religious so we don't see the point. I mentioned that if she decides she wants to be baptized when she's older then that's fine with me. My parents argued that we're all Catholic since we were baptized so she should be baptized as well. I said again that my fiance and I both aren't Catholic so we're not doing it to which my dad replied that since we were baptized we ARE Catholic, we're just not practicing Catholics.

I told them again that I don't believe in God and we're not religious so until our daughter decided for herself we weren't doing it. My dad said ""well what if you're wrong? I won't even say what would happen then"". Then my mom made some insane comment about ""where do you think humans came from?"" and ""if we evolved don't you think they would've found fish dna in humans years ago?"". 

My dad says that if she decides to do it when she's older she'll be embarrassed getting baptized as an adult and ""what if she wants to get married in a church?"". I replied ""how much does it mean to her then if she'd be embarrassed about it?"" and my dad started going off about how I wasn't giving him a good enough reason and he'll just have to take her to get baptized.

So AITA for not getting my daughter baptized ""just in case""??

TLDR: My fiance and I aren't religious & don't want baby baptized. Parents say there's no reason not to do it, and we should just in case we're wrong about God.",False,False
0,"AITA for refusing to tie my GF's shoes? | A few days ago I got into a bizarre argument with my GF. We were walking around town and one of her shoes got untied. She asked me if I could tie it for her. I told her that she can tie them herself. This kind of devolved into a small argument, where she said that I was too prideful to do a nice gesture for her in public. I said that she's not a little kid and that she's perfectly able to tie her own shoes. Then she was like, ""I see plenty of boyfriends tying their girlfriends' shoes in public, I don't know why you can't do the same"". 

At that point I just changed the topic and she took the hint and stopped bringing it up. Overall I'm all for doing sweet gestures, but I feel like asking me to tie her shoes was a little weird of a request. Like, why ask me to do something a kid should be able to do? Is this really a thing that girls like their boyfriends to do for them? Was I being an asshole here?",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I cancelled “my” engagement party? | Hi all, I’m looking for honest advice and I thought this would be the best place to get it.

So I got engaged recently and my friends and family want to celebrate. I work weekends so I’m always pretty busy but I had two dates that would be the best time for a dinner or something like that since me and my fiancé don’t want anything too big. We said we would be happy with a few drinks and not a party with lots of people, we only wanted something low-key since we’re both not really outgoing people.

That was fine, I told my parents and my mom picked one of the dates. To be very clear, it was agreed that this would be a dinner with only close family on my side, just a dinner with drinks and nothing else.

Then a couple of days ago, in front of most of my close family, my mom announces that we’re having a party in our house which includes my family and my fiancé’s. Everyone is really excited about it and my sister asks if she can invite her friends as well. Me and my fiancé are taken aback and don’t really know what to say and since I’ve been put in an awkward situation, I kind of agree to keep everyone happy.

I talked to my mom later privately and told her again we didn’t want a big party and she agreed, saying it wasn’t going to be “that big”. I asked how many people would likely be going and she said as many as you want, then listed off all the people on my side that would want to come. I tried to explain that my fiancé’s close family is quite big and they would not all fit in our house (We both still live with our parents but are trying to move out soon) but she kind of brushed it off and said that we could invite whoever we want.

Now this thing we didn’t want is growing arms and legs. My sister is inviting her friends who are wanting to get their hair professionally done for the party when I’m not even going to that effort myself. A distant family member is coming over from another country and people I barely know from distant parts of my family are asking if I’m having something and giving me very generous engagement presents. It made me and my fiancé feel quite uncomfortable to say the least.

I just want to say that we do appreciate that people want to celebrate the fact we got engaged and it’s nice of them to sort of organise something for us but not to this extent. We would probably have to book a venue and catering for all these people going now and we really don’t want to spend massive amounts of money since we’re trying to save.

My fiancé says we should just cancel everything and tell everyone the party is off but I’m more reluctant since I don’t want to offend anyone. So we’ve decided to take it to reddit because we’re both suck on what to do and how to handle this without coming off as complete assholes. 


So, would I be the asshole if I point blank cancelled this unwanted engagement party?",False,False
0,"AITA having only put two gifts under the tree this year? | To keep the story short, my family thought I have been working for a good company these past couple of weeks, but I left that job because I have been depressed for quite some time, and stacking 3rd shift hours with heavy lifting only left me questioning what I'm doing with my life every shift. I haven't told anybody, and feel so ashamed only buying small gifts for my family this year. My sister and her boyfriend came to visit as well from another state, but I really can't afford anything for them at the moment.

0,"AITA for not wanting my husband to take the kids to his grandfathers funeral? | Hear me out. My husband has struggled with his sobriety his whole adult life and things hit rock bottom in Feb of this year. After a lot of care and treatment he seemed to be doing well. He had a pretty good 5 months before this last relapse. 

We’ve been separated almost two months and he is currently about one month sober. I put the background info as I feel it’s important. He recently had one death in the family and now his grandfather isn’t expected to make it much longer. They have always been very close. This will devastate him. 

I’m truly worried about his sobriety.  He will be dealing with two close family members deaths, his family drinks heavily, he had some past child hood trauma with the people and places he will be . He is asking to take our elementary school kids to India (we live in the US) to see his grandfather and for the funeral. 

I have reservations for so many reasons. My concerns over his sobriety, the kids school, and quite frankly them going to another country without me. 

Even though my immediate reaction was to say no, I asked questions like “when, for how long, and who all is going” to try to get some clarity. 

I was met with “I asked you as a courtesy, I will hire a lawyer and take them if I have to”

I honestly was flabbergasted. Am I overthinking this?He says he “just” wants to take the kids to India to bury his grandfather”

I am in the library and the girl nearby is getting up every once in a while and can be gone for a good few hours at a time, but leaves her stuff at the desk for when she comes back. During exam time there is a rule in place that if gone for more than an hour, your stuff will be moved to give the space to someone else. Now this isn't in place at the moment, but it is considered respectful and etiquette all year round. The library is busy and so many people walk in and out looking for somewhere to work and sometimes walk out trying to find somewhere else if there is no space.

0,"AITA For not attending a traditional thanksgiving dinner with my family, though they want me to? | I love my family and I also love family gatherings, but I hate Thanksgiving. I find my family to be whiny, difficult, unhelpful, manipulative and generally exhausting on that day. Very few people participate in the planning and creation of the meal. The men don’t participate at all and when you finally get to the table someone is always upset because this year you made the cranberry sauce from scratch instead of pouring it out of a can or put real mushrooms in the casserole. I’m sure many people attend delightful culinary repasts where great memories are made, but to me its a day of drudgery and emotional minefields. 

The second-to-last time I attended my stepmother was dying from an awful disease and my father from 2 kinds of cancer. The meal was to be over at my sister‘s house and the family was supposed to come back to my house to play games, since the older generation could not travel. Thursday morning I dragged my poor SM into her special chair and hauled her into the living room so she would be ready when guests arrived. I prepared a full traditional meal for my dad and my BF, who stayed with my parents, and then I went to my sister‘s house. I hung out for a little, ate the meal and left. After all, there were people at my house who also needed to be fed. No one came back to my house. My SM waited all day and no one came over. Im so angry about it that even now it’s making me teary. My sister‘s response, “oh I didn’t think the plans were firm.“ Then she went on to tell me that her son (10 at the time) cried in his room beclause I left so suddenly. My step-brother didn’t even bother to comment. He was a ghost the entire time his mom was sick.

I‘m still pretty upset about it because it was just the icing on the cake of a year in which I felt abandoned by my siblings, while I cared for our parents.

Fast forward 5 years and my sister is repeatedly asking me to come over. She just texted me again with guilt about the kids wondering why I won’t come over. At this point I just answer that I’m not coming because I don‘t want to. I’m 51 years old and I know what I want and it‘s to be left in peace on that day. FWIW I do go to other family gatherings.

Am I am asshole for this? I’m crying right now. I don’t want to be a jerk and I don’t want to hurt anyone, but that day always sucks, and I just don’t want to go.",False,False
1,"AITA for telling a girl to stop constantly bragging about getting into a slightly above average college? | It's that time of year we when seniors in high school are applying to colleges, and there's this girl at my school, let's call her Lauren, who is the type of girl who seems to think she's so smart and popular, but really isn't. She applied to Boston U ED and got in, and ever since she got in, she constantly brags about it- on Insta, on snapchat, and even in person, which is just insufferable. Like, if you got into a school you think is a good fit for you and all that, props. But when you have to tell everyone every five minutes, especially when it's not that great of a school to begin with, it gets annoying.

&#x200B;

When I say it's not a super great school, I'm not pulling stuff out of my ass, I've done research. Boston U was on my list of schools I was going to apply to if I was rejected or deferred by my No. 1 choice in ED. And it was a safety, for good reason- it has a low-is admissions rate (29%), but that's really deceiving- the low acceptance rate is due to a *lot of people,* qualified or not, applying to it rather than it actually being competitive for people who had the stats. The average GPA and SAT for those admitted isn't that high- 3.7 and 1400, which is pretty easy. 

&#x200B;

So that's really part of what has annoyed me about Lauren's bragging- first, it's annoying and kind of pretentious to flex your college acceptances on people. And while it still would be douchey to do so, if she had gotten admitted to an Ivy, Stanford, MIT, or a college of similar caliber, at least their bragging would have merit.

&#x200B;

So the next time she started bringing it up (in the most annoying way possible- literally, she said, 'when I'm in Boston next year, cause y'know I'm going to Boston University, I'll be ....') to me, I just straight up told her it was really annoying for her to keep trying to flex on everyone, and nobody gives a shit. She tried to pull the 'but it's a good college, I deserve to be proud', but I pointed out a) being proud is different than bragging and b) no, it isn't even that great of a school. 

&#x200B;

This caused her to get upset at me and call me a 'rude dick'. I don't see I'm the rude one as opposed to the girl who's literally trying to flex on everyone with her slightly-above-average college acceptances.",False,False

but she's borderline-obese and getting worse, sorry but she buys and eats junk food literally every day. chocolate, candy, even just unhealthy-ass meals like cooked in hella butter, hot dogs and bacon always in the freezer, whatever

I have a problem with junk food too, I'm still healthy-looking with a shirt on but being with a partner who has it around all the time has made me skinny-fat where I used to look athletic.

1,"AITA for telling a scary story to my girlfriend's little cousin? | Last night my girlfriend was at her house and babysitting her young 5 year old cousin. Her parents and aunt and uncle were out for the night and she invited me over so that we could spend some time together whilst watching out for her cousin. I won't divulge his real name, but let's just call him Timmy. Timmy was actually well behaved throughout the night. He put his own messes away, he politely asked when he wanted something, and he was just an all-around good kid. When it came time to tuck him in, he asked me and my girlfriend to tell him a scary story. My girlfriend's mind was a blank and I didn't have anything to offer, so I just decided to improvise and make something up on the spot.

I looked out the window and saw a streetlight and I got the idea to tell the story of a monster called the ""Bunyin"", a tall demon that disguises itself as streetlights during the day and spies on kids in the neighborhood to see which kids are bad and good. He doesn't do anything to the good kids, but when the bad kids are asleep, he drops the streetlight facade, reaches into their windows and takes them away to his underground lair. Timmy was noticeably creeped out, but I told him that he didn't have anything else to worry about since he was a good kid. We bid him goodnight and we hung out for a little while longer, but then Timmy starts screaming. We rush into his room and he's pointing outside his window...at a streetlight. He's crying and screaming ""BUNYIN! BUNYIN!"" We told him to calm down and that it was just a story, but he wouldn't settle down. My girlfriend told me that it was probably for the best if I left and I agreed.

Well, this morning I got called to my girlfriend's house and her parents and aunt and uncle were waiting for me and they didn't look happy. They asked if I told him a scary story about the Bunyin and I said yes. They told me that the story caused Timmy to flee the house early in the morning and they couldn't find him anywhere nearby. They were about to report him missing when one of their neighbors came by with Timmy in his car and he brought him home when he saw him running down the street. I immediately felt guilty about that part and my girlfriend's uncle was really letting me have it. He starts telling me that it would've been all my fault had Timmy been abducted while running away. I argued that Timmy wanted me to tell him a scary story in the first place, but they didn't want to hear it. They asked me to leave and never come near Timmy again.

Even my girlfriend made me feel like shit about it. Me and her both occasionally browse the r/UnresolvedMysteries page and my girlfriend said ""This is what causes kids to vanish and never be seen again."" I tried to add some levity by saying ""Well, I guess we know why Asha Degree left her house.""

The husband and I started a business 5 years ago and now we’re pretty well-off. He grew up in a poor environment and now that he’s successful people from his childhood have taken notice.

He dated his high school ex-girlfriend for 3 years. When she was 16 she was pregnant with twins and miscarried at 6 months after an accident. This really traumatized them and their relationship was broken after, he left for college a year later and they broke up. 

Since then life has been very difficult for her (their mothers are family friends). She’s been through some bad shit including depression, drug addiction and yesterday she called him after years of no contact, to say that she is being kicked out of her apartment. She asked him for some help, namely enough rent for 2 months ($1000). He said that unfortunately he cannot help and that she’s essentially a stranger to him.

I berated him for his response and told him to have some empathy. Yes she may have problems but she’s a human who he used to have an intimate relationship with. He should help her because that’s the good thing to do. He said if I cared so much then I could write a check and “never expect to get it back”.

1,"AITA because I didn't lose the weight I promised I would to fit in my sister's bridesmaid dresses? | So my sister has basically been the Kim Jong Un of brides and I am not sure how to proceed here. Part of me feels like I was asked to be a bridesmaid, I should remain a bridesmaid but part of me feels like I should tell her to kiss my crack and not even go. 

We did bridesmaid fitting back in September. I am a bigger girl and I did not fit into the dress. I assumed it wouldn't be too hard to lose the weight. The dresses she chose were very cute but not fit for someone my size. She offered to get something a little more ""size neutral"" but I could tell she really liked the first pick so I said I would lose the weight (I've always wanted to anyways). 

Well wedding is next weekend and I don't even come close to fitting in the dress. It can't even be altered to accommodate me. My sister is livid with me. I told her that I really did try but she says she doesn't believe me at all because she claims ""it's physics, you eat less, you lose weight."" 

She is demanding that contact the designer and get him to rush a dress in near as my size as possible and she'll pay me ""back"" (yeah right, I've known her since she was born and she STILL owes me money).

My boyfriend is refusing because he says he doesn’t like talking in front of people and it’s ‘his decision to make’. I suggested that he writes the speech and someone else reads it, or he records it. He still says no.

His best friend is really sentimental and him giving a speech would mean the world.

1,"AITA for not wanting to replace something my dog chewed, that wasn't mine? | I have a pupper. He is a chewer. I have roommates , who were very okay with me getting a pup (as I had asked prior because I respect them). We are all adults, I figure it is not difficult to clean up after ourselves to prevent my little guy from getting into nonsense that 1. can ruin their stuff and 2. can harm him. 

My dog chewed 3 of my roommates shoes because they were left out. We have a closet designated for coats and shoes so, thy cant it be used? I use it and my dog has never torn up a pair of my shoes. I'd like to add, in the beginning She gave my dog a shoe to chew on that she didn't wear just to let him chew something (mind you he has plenty of toys) but this lead to him thinking it is OK to chew shoes. I told her to stop allowing that because it will teach him that it is ok to chew on them......

Yes, this is an uncontrolled environment. But, I am doing a very decent job with my pup as I give him what he needs/wants and he is very smart. He is a dog , these are dog instincts. Yes, maybe he should be trained a bit better to not chew on things but, hey! If it wasn't out in the first place it wouldn't' be a problem.

1,"AITA for exposing a man as a fake veteran before his wedding? | I'm from New Zealand and i live in Ireland at the moment. One of my friends, Kathy, is Irish and had been dating another kiwi named John. John claimed to be a member of the New Zealand Royal navy. I knew he was a phony from the beginning, since i am a member myself i noticed him wearing the uniform incorrectly on social media and when i met him at a party he told me stuff that didn't make sense such as serving in units that would've been impossible with his occupation and time he claimed to have enlisted etc. I have told Kathy and her friends my concerns but they never believed me because he had photos of him with groups of other navy guys on ships. Im guessing either photoshop or maybe he had a bunch of other phonies dress up on a ship or something idk. 

I was able to get someone i knew in the service to search up his name and i found that he actually enlisted but was dishonorably discharged within a week of entering for bad conduct. Obviously this means he is not a lieutenant and should not have any uniforms. I get this information within a few weeks before his wedding. There's several legal ways to do this but i don't want to get into it for confidentiality.

  Kathy's brother emailed around 1600 making announcements for the wedding. This allowed me to get everyone's emails. I sent an email explaining all the discrepancies of his uniforms, stories he told, and finally proof submitting his discharge papers. Kathy decided to cancel the wedding and there was massive flame war that occurred, via email. I didn't even know that was possible but it happened. People went on saying how was a scumbag that should've minded my own business. Other people have told me that i should've told Kathy this privately but i feel everyone should've known that this man was a lying piece of shit. Kathy was initially angry but has now thanked me. I have gotten angry hate mail from John's family but I've ignored it

1,"AITA for ignoring my friend after she had a breakdown on her birthday? | A couple of weeks ago it was my friend, Claire’s, birthday. She decided to have her first drink ever and throughout the night she had more, though not a lot in my opinion (but I could be wrong considering her weight and other factors).

She’s been acting kind of weird all night, but not really drunk, more just awkward. She’d had about 4 shots and was seemingly sober when she came to me and said that she was acting weird because she could blame it on the alcohol and I didn’t really mind the statement since she wasn’t really whoring herself out for attention or anything, just being goofy.

She gets served a full glass of vodka but finished maybe a third and starts getting emotional. I laugh (mostly because I’ve had some to drink and I knew she would be embarrassed the next day). She starts crying and just letting loose so much about her life. She’s frustrated about a lot of things like her grandparents health and a crush she has. She was also stressed because she thought I was mad at her (I wasn’t, just sick at texting and getting back to people if they don’t really attempt to talk to me).

It gets to the point where we take her for a drive around town so she could get some fresh air and she begins to break down HEAVY. She’s sobbing and venting about things but quickly starts talking about how much the people in the car mean to her. 

It’s just my other friend Lily and her boyfriend Rob, but she starts talking about how Lily is such a good friend to her and how Rob (who she’d met for the first time an hour earlier) was one of her good friends and how she hoped he wanted to be her friend. The part where I got unnerved was she said nothing about me.

I know that might sound selfish and conceited but I’ve always agreed with “drunk words are sober thoughts” and I guess it just made me think that my friendship with her didn’t really matter that much to her. I was in the backseat with her and with her during the party, watching out for her and making sure she was fine. I was crying with her in the car when she was breaking down because I truly felt for her situation and I felt horribly, while Lily and Rob were laughing at her. I’d been friends with her for 7 years now and I thought that I’d have at least gotten a mention. I talked to her every day for month long periods and I just thought we were close.

Now, about 3 weeks later, I haven’t really tried to talk to her. I responded to her occasional texts bit I don’t really try to keep the conversation going And they don’t really come that often, maybe 2 or 3 times she’s tried to text me.

I've been going to this school for two years (both summer semesters included), and the whole thing just doesn't feel right. I don't fit in with the people there, I don't have any friends, I don't feel challenged in class, and I'm bored. Instead of feeling like a college student, I feel like I'm still in high school. I feel like I'm missing out on the college experience. I want to transfer to another school, but my family is always talking about how important it is to have ""our best and brightest"" attending HBCUs instead of PWIs (predominantly white institutions). I don't exactly consider myself to be exceptionally bright, but I feel like being unhappy about where I am currently is a slap in the face to those that came before me (read: those who legally were not allowed to attend PWIs in the first place).

0,"AITA for locking my roommates out when they don’t bring a key? | 
I’m 21F, my 2 roommates are 19F(Liz), and 24F(Kendra). We’ve been rooming for 4 months, we knew each other from friends and growing up in the same area.

We get along but there’s been one really annoying fuckin issue and it’s that neither of them bring their house keys when they leave. 

This has resulted in me being woken up out of my sleep, me NOT being able to sleep because they’ll text me “I’m about to be home in an hour, can you open the door for me?”
I’ve even had to come home early from events or not be able to go anywhere because they won’t have a key to get in.

What’s their reason for not bringing it? I have no idea. I guess they both grew up having the door opened for them at any time they desired. 

Kendra will forget her key about 5-8 times a month, she’s not as bad as Liz who literally NEVER brings her key anywhere. But the problem with Kendra is she’ll come home at the most inconvenient of times; when it’s late asf, when I’m in the shower, when I’m in the bathroom, when I’m all showered, lotion/oiled up and just want to stay in my clean room. 

Trust me, I’ll be leaving when the lease is up, but for now, I’m stuck. 

I found one of those dead bolt key pads for $70 and told the girls we should split it.
Guess what? These cheap bitches don’t want to contribute. 

I straight up told them they better remember to bring their keys starting right then and there cause I’m not opening the door anymore. 

Liz thought I was bluffing cause she didn’t bring her key again last week and I wouldn’t open the door so Kendra had to stop by and let her in. She waited about 30 mins under our porch in the rain. 

A few days ago Kendra got a ride home from her bf and forgot to bring her car/house keys and couldn’t get in after midnight and I didn’t let her in so she spent the night at her bfs and blamed me cause she couldn’t properly get ready for work in the morning. 
Just a few hours ago, Liz got home and called and rang the doorbell, but I didn’t let her in until Kendra got home. They walked pass my room and called me a bitch but they can suck my ass. 

I told my bf, and some family about it and their general reply was just “yea it’s annoying but don’t lock them out. It’s not that big of a deal”. It may sound not that big of a deal when it’s not happening to you but it’s fuckin annoying being woken up at 4 am to walk downstairs and open the door for someone, plus I can’t fall back asleep right away so I end up losing like 2 hours of rest.

0,"WIBTA if I told my dad his vacation planning hurt my feelings | I (25f) have a good relationship with my dad (54m) and my stepmom, who have been married 15 years as well as my brother (24m), my older half sister from his first marriage (38f) and my two younger half sisters (12f) from his current marriage. I consider them all my equal siblings and have put a lot of effort to keep in touch with everyone despite living in different cities.

Since my parents divorce, I've spent every other holiday with each of my parents (Thanksgiving with my mom and Christmas with my dad one year, then reversed the next, and so on). If we ever went on a family trip, my dad would usually buy all of the siblings plane tickets/accommodations/etc., which I recognize is very generous. When my older sister got married, he told her she would need to start buying her own flights. Between that and her now having children, she doesn't make it on as many family vacations. I've always been nervous about the same thing happening to me as I am now in a serious relationship and my bf (we moved in together a few months ago). 

Recently, when I was visiting my dad, we were hanging out in the living room with a group of people (both family and friends) and I saw a lot of library books for one country so I asked if one of my younger sisters was doing a school project. My dad responded that they were actually preparing for a trip him, my stepmom, and my little sisters were doing for Thanksgiving. 

I was surprised bc this year is my Thanksgiving with my dad and I planned on coming to his for the holiday. I hadn't heard anything about this trip. They had already booked flights and accommodations.  

My dad must have noticed my surprise bc he explained that if I wanted to join, I would have to buy my own flights and they would get me accommodations etc. This is more than fair to me but I feel hurt that they booked the trip without saying anything to me. They haven't sent me their flights or dates so it doesn't really seem like they want me to join. However, we were in a group setting so it didn't seem like the right time to bring anything up. 

This isn't really about the vacation or the flights but I do feel excluded. However, they also excluded my brother so it could be possible they just want a vacation for just their smaller family. Is this is even something I should bring up or am I overreacting? After all, Thanksgiving is many many months away.",False,False
1,"AITA for not letting ex husband pick up our daughter early? | I have been divorced from my ex husband for 3 years. I moved away with my daughter from where we used to live with him to my hometown three hours away to be closer to my parents. We have a custody order in place that says he is to pick her up at 6pm (due to school schedule) on his designated Fridays.

My ex texted me asking if since it’s summer vacation if he can pick her up earlier this Friday assuming we didn’t have plans. His reasoning is that it happens to be his wife’s and his first anniversary and they have plans that evening. His older kids will be over to babysit the youngest child and he thinks it will be a good opportunity for our daughter to spend time with her siblings (they don’t get to see each other very often).  Instead of 6pm, he is wondering if we can meet earlier in the day since pick up/drop off is a 2 hour round trip. My ex just moved into a brand new house and I know my daughter really wants to see it and misses her brothers and sister but I do NOT like deviating from the parenting plan. I told him that the court order was put in place to provide structure and stability to our daughter and as her parents it’s our responsibility to uphold that. He is upset and brought up how I refused to let him take her to Disney Land with her siblings a few summers back but that was because he asked during my time. I’ll admit he has let me have her during one of his weeks but that was because it coincided with one of her camps. He thinks I am being selfish and inflexible and given the choice she would love to come over, even if it was earlier. However, I think it’s important to stick to the official parenting plan and not allow for changes.",False,False
1,"AITA for taking bets at a wedding as to what year the couple would divorce? (not as bad as it sounds...I hope!) | This happened over the weekend and I feel pretty bad about how it went down, but my intentions were honorable here. I was the Best Man at my pal's wedding. 

I got the idea to start up a bet and collect a pool from other people attending the wedding. The basic idea is that participants guess a year in which the couple will divorce and put in a certain amount of money (minimum bet $50), and IF they end up divorcing during that year whoever guessed that year wins the whole pot. 

So for example, if 2 people guesses the year 2025, if the couple actually divorces in 2025, those 2 people would split the whole pot. (We raised a little over 3 grand total, so like $1500 each in this example.) 

BUT, if the couple is still married after the latest bet in the pool (somebody put 2040) then the couple gets the entire pot. 

So that was kind of the twist that I meant to convey to them, that yeah sure it was a real bet, but that if they stayed together they could expect 3 grand in 2041. 

When I was explaining the bet during my best man speech that was how I was going to end, kind of with a charming/corny line that ""But we all know none of us are going to be winning the bet, because you two will be together forever, so you can look forward to cashing in in 2041!"" 

Yes, if they actually divorced and if somebody in the betting pool nailed the right year we would follow up and that person would get the winnings. But I don't think these two will get divorced, they're perfect for each other. 

That was supposed to be my intended message, it was supposed to be a kind of fun silly thing. 

Before I could even get to that part the bride started crying and the parents and bridesmaids and all that were almost yelling at me, and the groom (my best friend of decades) was furious. 

Even later that night when I explained to him my intent he wouldn't even listen to me. The bride especially apparently ""feels betrayed by everyone"" who participated in the bet. Even though I explained that I had misled all of them by saying the bride and groom knew about it in advance that wouldn't make them less angry. 

So needless to say I feel extremely bad. But I meant it all as a nice gesture and I feel if they could just see they have a near certainty of getting a free 3 grand in 2041 they could see this intention. I think by then it will be a fond memory and a ""look back on it laugh"" kind of thing when we get to the 2040's, plus a nice little bonus of a 3 grand prize. 

I keep trying to explain this but my friend isn't hearing it, especially when I told him that I still had to follow up with whoever ""wins"" on the off-chance they do get divorced. But I really doubt they'd ever get divorced. 

I know I went about it the wrong way but I don't feel I was the A here, but I want to see what reddit thinks. 

tl;dr - Collected bets to see what year my friends would divorce at their wedding, but if they don't get divorced they win, I meant it to be nice/sweet but they are both furious at me. ",False,False
1,"AITA for encouraging my wife to breastfeed? | My wife is 22, I am 25 and we have a 1 month old baby girl. 

After giving birth, my wife breastfed our baby for a couple of weeks. She says breastfeeding tires her and she gets discouraged when she doesn’t produce enough milk. I’ve read a lot of sources which says breastfeeding is healthiest for the baby. She knows this too, considering she’s a nurse.

But she says she doesn’t think she can do it. I bought a breast pump but she barely uses it. She wants to formula feed our baby. I don’t think this is a good idea. Our baby is only 1 month old...

I don’t get why she would formula feed when breastfeeding is so much more natural and better for the baby. I’ve bought her lots of foods which are supposed to increase milk production. She HAS milk, but she just says she doesn’t like the action of breastfeeding. It makes her “feel like a cow”. I think thats a bit ridiculous.

She cried yesterday and said she says I’m making her feel like a bad mother. That’s absolutely not my intention. I apologized and said I just wanted our daughter to grow up healthy and strong.

When I was born, my mom told her mom and stepdad that I would not ever be going to their house because they used to smoke so often, and inside their home. They ended up quitting cold turkey the day I was born, and to my knowledge, they havnt smoked since (23 years later).

As I turned off the car and gathered my belongings, a man on the sidewalk approached the car and started talking to me through the window. I’d seen him on the sidewalk when he pulled up, but it looked like he was waiting for an Über. 

He asked me, “Are you parking here?” 

I replied, “Yes.”

He told me, “I’ve been saving this spot for a friend.”

I’ve never seen someone save a parking spot on the street for another person, so I asked, “What?”

He told me he was saving the spot for a friend. I said, “I’m not sure that’s how it works.” He told me it was. I asked him if he wanted me to move and he said he’d hopped out of his friend’s car to save the spot, because there’d been cars behind him. I said I’d been looking for a spot for a while, my rental was running, and I didn’t want to hunt for another parking spot. 

He said he didn’t want to parking spot anymore and that I was an asshole. His friend pulled up towards the end of our exchange, so they rode off together. 

Looking back, I can see why I was an asshole to them. In my defense, he never asked me to move, and he was annoyed with me for parking from the start. If he’d explained the situation right away and been polite, I would’ve given him the spot. It was the end of a long day, and his request seemed ridiculous to me.

We have two kids (14F/16M). When they were 10 and 12 my husband and I both became vegetarians. Then last year we became vegan. We never forced our diet on them but we do talk to them about our beliefs concerning animal cruelty and animal products. They know that we’re serious about our new lifestyle and it’s not temporary.

Now our kids still eat meat when they’re at school and we’re fine with that. They know we only cook vegan dishes at home. But recently they’ve been lashing out at rules we’ve established concerning meat in the house. We don’t permit any meats or animal based foods in our house or fridge (they can eat whatever they want outside the house) but our kids think we’re being unfair to them. 

Last week my daughter had friends over and they ordered a pepperoni pizza when my husband and I were out of the house. When we got back and saw the boxes we told her she disrespected us and our rules and grounded her for 2 weeks.

Last fall, his family offered for us to visit and stay in their flat in Prague.  I researched airfares and asked my two kids if they would be willing to pay $1000 each to cover their airfare.  At first, they declined but subsequently agreed.  They are 16 (twins) and have summer jobs.  They each already had enough in savings to cover the cost.

We are a middle class family (maybe more towards lower-middle class).  My wife has a disability so we are a single-income family.  We travel for vacations occasionally and I have never asked my kids to contribute to a vacation before.

The airfare turned out to be $775 each.  When I let my kids know this, I was surprised that my daughter was nearly in tears.  Her recollection was that I had told her the airfare was $375.  This is the cost for the return airfare - I don't know where the miscommunication came in. She is VERY fastidious with her money and this extra cost really upset her.  I explained that the original amount I told them was $1000 and that this was a deal.  I told her that she would have to pay the $775 or that she could not go.  If I offered her a reduced fare, I would have to do the same for her brother. The trip would then cost me an extra $800.

My wife says that IATA because parents shouldn't charge their kids to go on vacation.  A couple of her friends went to Europe with their families when they were teenagers and they didn't have to contribute financially.  I feel that we wouldn't get to go otherwise and that most kids don't get to travel to Europe.

0,"AITA for yelling at my mom for letting my niece use my loofah? | Some backstory: I, personally, am pretty intolerant of coming in contact with other people's germs, and germs in general, which my mother is full aware of. I'm also kinda territorial over my belongings.

Now, my grandparents brought my four-year-old niece over today, and after a few hours, she was getting pretty bored at the house. My mother took her to the pool for a few hours and came back. I wasn't aware that they went to the pool or gave her a shower at all. 

Several hours later, nearly midnight (I usually shower right before I go to bed), and I get in the shower, only to find that my loofah (sponge) was scattered with hairs and filled excessively with soap. This really irritated me, and made me very reluctant to use it.

After my shower, my mother came upstairs for some reason, and I expressed how upset I was for not only using my loofah on my pool-soaked niece, but for leaving it full of soap and hair (she's the one who advised me to clear my loofahs of soap). She reminded me several times that ""she's your niece and she's four years old."" I told her that I didn't care and that I wouldn't want anybody else using it, not even if I had a clone of myself. She told me that I'm a ""mean boy,"" went back downstairs.

0,"AITA, for denying kids Halloween candy and making a seven year old boy want to fight me. | First and foremost I'm going to start this off by saying I'm using a throwaway account so go away Heather. 

So tonight was Halloween, and my family and I live in a quite middle class neighbourhood. The normal candy-hander-outer is my Mother because she can tolerate children more than the rest of us, but she was working late because of <insert work problem here> so I manned the fort while she was gone. 

The night was quiet overall, not many kids and the ones that did come were nice and most importantly had cool costumes. Well about 10 minutes before my Mom got home there, was a singular ring of the doorbell. No problem, I stand up and go to the door. In about the 30 seconds it took me to stand up and get to the door it had rung (not even exaggerating) about 35-50 more times. Whoever was spamming this doorbell had Starcraft Grandmaster level APM. Of course by now I'm mad. Asking for free candy is fine one night a year but this is just rude. I swing the door open and see 3 kids, all about 7-8 years old, one of which is still pressing the doorbell. These kids had no parents, no supervisors, no costumes (literally just a witch hat on two of them and a zombie mask on the other one.) Pissed off, I say ""You rang the doorbell too many times. Go away"" and accept anything that comes from the blowback, a TP attack, an egging, whatever. These kids are not getting candy, fuck them. 

About 10 minutes later, my Mom is finally home when the doorbell rings again. What do you know Starcraft APM girl is back at it. My Mom opens the door and about 10 seven year olds (likely after my head) and they were asking for candy, again. My Mom is a much more patient person than so she hands them candy. Afters, zombie mask kid takes off his mask and says ""Bring that guy out here I have a few words for him."" (Respectfully, I declined)  

So I guess one question remains, AITA for not giving these clearly rude kids candy on Halloween? This has divided my friend group and I for about the past 2-3 hours so I'll let you guys decide. 

tldr: Refused to give kids Halloween candy because they mashed our doorbell repeatedly for candy. ",False,False
0,"WIBTA for not inviting this person to my birthday party? | Quick background: I'm a hostess at a restaurant. There's only 4 of us.

So I'm planning on throwing a birthday party. I literally have not had a party since middle school and I've spent every birthday alone. This is the first time I've actually wanted to celebrate my birthday, so it's a little special for me.

I became good friends with all of the hostesses except one, we'll call her Patty.

Patty is rude, mean, snotty and condescending. She treats everything like a competition and you can't have a conversation without her making it about herself. All around unpleasant person.

It's to the point where a couple of the hostesses, me included, have had to report her to management because of her behavior.

Point is: I don't like Patty.

But also: I don't like excluding people.

I've been bullied all throughout my school life and I even had to leave my previous job because of bullying, so I have a soft spot regarding that.

The restaurant has such a small crew that it wouldn't take that long for her to realize she would be the only hostess not invited and it makes me feel hella guilty. Being excluded from stuff hurts and I don't want to inflict that on someone else, even someone as unpleasant as Patty. I don't want to feel like I'm stooping to her level.

On the other hand, it's my birthday and I want to celebrate it with friends and loved ones. It's supposed to be a joyous, drama-free, positive occasion and I don't want someone there who will make me or other guests uncomfortable.

Would I be an asshole if I didn't invite her?

Or should I just extend the invite to be nice and then pray to all the powers-at-be that she doesn't come?",False,False
0,"AITA for walking out on H&R Block lady? | She was super nice and friendly but in the end it come down to price. She did our taxes for two years now. It was always pricey but she always got us by far the biggest return until this time . After all the work, She said that it’s going to be $450 to file for a 3k refund. I did TurboTax before coming to her and got refund of $2870 to file for $45. So if I file with her I loose extra $200ish. So I told her sorry we are not going to pay for this. Obviously she wasn’t happy my husband wasn’t happy with me either cuz he was just going to bite the bullet. But i felt like in the end I was just straight up getting ripped off. For reference last two years were about $200 and $250 to file. I feel to be honest pretty bad cuz I know it’s not her fault that the company raised prices. But at the same time I was ambushed by the price and it’s a free country so I said I am sorry we are just not going to pay that much for taxes and walked out. So AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for yelling at a friend when she said that I should think about cancelling my wedding because my fiancée has recently become disabled | My fiancée and I are planning on getting married in September, and we’ve been together for 5 years now. A month ago she got into an accident that has her in a wheelchair. She’s been seeing a physical therapist about prosthetics but for now at least there’s no walking happening.

It’s been... an adjustment for both of us, and I won’t say it’s gone perfectly, but you can’t expect something like this to transition perfectly. I recently went out with a couple friends, and I was talking about my fiancée and how she was doing when one of them asked if I had thought about calling off the wedding.

I immediately said no and asked why I would, and she started talking about how she’s going to be a burden and I don’t want to start the better part of my life with dead weight as a wife.

This really pissed me off and I yelled at her that just because she got into an accident doesn’t make her worthless and that she should shut her mouth if only shit is going to come out of it. I’ll admit I made a bit of a scene, so I left and went home.

My fiancée says that I shouldn’t have been so harsh and that she can see where my friend is coming from and that she only has my best interests in mind. This honestly really surprised me since my friend was talking about her, and she’s saying I should have been less harsh. So I’m wondering whether I went overboard since the woman getting trashed even thinks I was too harsh.

0,"AITA for leaving read receipts off? | On mobile, so excuse formatting etc. tl;dr at bottom.

A while ago my girlfriend mentioned that when we text she never sees the little notification in the messages app that tells you when the other person has read a text. At the time I thought it was just a glitch in my phone because I have been having other minor issues with iMessage as well lately, and told her truthfully I didn’t know what was up with it. 

She expressed to me that it wasn’t a huge deal but she just liked to know when I’ve seen/read her message so she knows that I got it.

Fast forward a couple weeks to when I was poking around in my Phone’s settings and I found the “Enable/Disable Read Receipts” Option. Mine was off by default for some reason. When I saw that I decided to leave it off.

My thoughts behind the decision: Nowadays there is a pressure to be always available and respond to every text you get instantly. I personally don’t like this and prefer to think about my responses sometimes. When that read receipt pops up the person expects a response shortly. In the past (when my read receipts were on, again not sure how the setting was disabled) I have had people ask me something to the effect of “I saw you read my text at [insert time] but didn’t respond until [insert later time], what’s up with that?” And it’s usually pretty awkward to just say you wanted to think about what to say. 

My thoughts aside, I haven’t told my girlfriend that it’s actually a setting I left turned off. She has not brought it up again and it hasn’t been a problem, since I respond immediately to anything urgent/time sensitive and never just ignore texts for more than a couple hours. 

Am I being an asshole here?

tl;dr: girlfriend asked why my read receipts weren’t showing up, I found out later I had the setting disabled, left it off intentionally, and haven’t told her",False,False
1,"AITA for my comment on my husband's weight loss? | Throwaway because people know my account.

I (F36), have been married to my husband (M40), for 9 years now. When I first met him about 12 years ago, he was on the chubbier side, but I wouldn't say he was massively overweight. He stayed near enough that way for a long time.

About a year ago, he began going to the gym frequently and focused on his weight tremendously. The effects became apparent quickly. He transformed his body and became pretty fit. Of course, I supported him and tried my best to help him throughout his journey.

Yesterday, we were cuddling in bed and I made what I thought was a 'harmless' comment. I jokingly told him that cuddling was better back then before his weight loss because he was squishier. I didn't mean any harm towards him. However, I could instantly tell he didn't like it and he left to the bathroom quickly. After he returned he said he was tired of cuddling and to 'leave him alone'.

1,"AITA for buying a second present for my boyfriend after he told me he doesn't like surprises? | So here's the thing. I have a new boyfriend and he is the sweetest, best guy I've known in a long time. A few days after we started dating, I wanted to get him a necklace (because he usually wears a silver chain with an arrow). 

I looked everywhere in the shops around campus but couldn't find something I liked for him. But he was going out of the city for two weeks, and I wanted to get him something to remind him of me, I decided to settle on a t-shirt and a Keychain with the necklace to come at a future date. 

He told me that 1. He didn't like surprises so I shouldn't put him on the spot by giving him something out of the blue and 2. he didn't like the shirt and that he's very picky about clothes. But he did appreciate that I made the effort and told me that he loved the gesture. This was strange to me, because no matter what anyone ever gives me, I wouldn't tell them it's ""not my style"". 

Anyway, whatever. I like him. Small things don't bother me. So after he left, I was shopping and found a nice manly looking black necklace. But once again he said that he didn't like surprises and I shouldn't have done it. That if I wanted to buy something for him, I should run it by him (or shop together). 

I told him that if he liked it, he could have it. Otherwise he didn't have to take it. 

So am I the asshole for getting him a present even though he said he didn't like surprises? On one hand I think I'm just trying to do something nice for him, so he shouldn't react this way. But in the other hand I feel that if this is the price of admission to be with him, I should just accept it and not surprise him with a gift again. 

Tl;dr: bf doesn't like me surprising him with presents, but I got him a second gift anyway and he didn't like either. AITA?

1,"AITA for hiding my husband's shirts? | My 39 year old husband dresses like a child. For work, he wears a button up shirt, jeans or Dockers, multi-colored sneakers and a belt with a large buckle of an animal. On weekends, he wears a t-shirt with some sort of comic/cartoon logo/character, a comic book character logo hat, jeans, multi-colored sneakers, a belt with a large buckle of a comic book character and his comic book character logo baseball hat. The only people who ever compliment his clothes are teens.

&#x200B;

He claims that other people at his work dress the same way, and they do ... but they don't wear huge belt buckles with animals on them and their shoes are more muted - all black sneakers, for example.

&#x200B;

I've tried all the hints - buying him nice clothes, shoes ... they all get returned or stuffed in the closet. I confronted him and said I would find him much more attractive if he dressed more his age, he laughed me off and said that when we met, he dressed the same so why should he change now, his is who he is.

&#x200B;

But when we met, we were 28. And he did NOT wear these clothes as often as he does now because even then he knew that girls aren't exactly attracted to a guy wearing comic book character shirts. I think it's a combo of the popularity of the Marvel movies and now him having a wife that has basically given him license to feel like he can wear whatever the fuck he wants. It's really the combination of it all together - clown shoes, comic book shirt, comic book belt buckle and hat that are just so stupid looking, I can't stand it. HE'S GONNA BE 40 FFS.

&#x200B;

I've told him this and he just shrugs. 

&#x200B;

A month ago, we went to a party and all the guys were dressed so nicely and simply ... and then there's my husband in his Deadpool hat, shorts, clown shoes, Batman belt and Green Lantern hat. Even his mates were poking fun at his outfit. 

&#x200B;

So I took a bunch of his shirts, packed them away and hid them. He has SO many shirts (he's a shopper and sucks at doing the laundry, but that's a separate issue) that I knew he wouldn't notice for awhile. He started dressing nicer - he assumed his comic book shirts were dirty so he started wearing plain t-shirts and polos that he usually never touches. He looked so nice and handsome, like how he did when we started dating. I love it. Shower him with affection because he looks SO MUCH BETTER. Tell him how nice he looks.

&#x200B;

Well, a month later, he found the box of shirts. He's now pissed at me. I told him it was for his own good, but he's not having any of it. He left for work mad at me but I really don't think I did anything wrong. It's not like I threw them away or donated them or something. Tonight will be interesting.

&#x200B;

Anyway ... am I the asshole?

0,"WIBTA if I asked my fiancé to skip his family Christmas every other year? | My fiancé (38 M) and I (31 F) have been together for about five years now. My parents are dead or not in my life so I always spend Christmas with his family. They are fine people overall but over the years I’ve started to find it overwhelming. Between occasional family drama, everything being a production, and myself generally being an introvert, I’m starting to find it more overwhelming as the years pass.

A couple of years, we have done our own thing. Either staying home and celebrating by ourselves in the city, or taking a trip. His parents were upset but honestly, if my parents were alive, we would probably be trading back-and-forth so I really don’t get what the big deal is. TBH these were the best Christmases we’ve had yet – – no screaming kids, no having to cook, no carefully orchestrated activities, just us spending time together and having a little holiday romance. It was blissful.

I would like to make it a semi annual tradition, at least until we have our own children. Every other Christmas, I’d like to take a nice trip just the two of us. We will continue to buy presents for family members, particularly nieces and nephews, and go to the Christmas next year. But I would like to make it not an every year thing so I can start to occasionally look forward to the holidays again.

Her car was in the shop, so I offered to pick her up. I got off work at 4pm, and then I was ready to go get her. 

I texted my wife these plans and she got upset. 

She said she had to get the kids from school, get groceries, make dinner and get the kids ready. She said she didn’t want my mom to be sitting there watching her going 100 miles an hour while she did everything and that if I was getting off work early she could use the help instead of me driving and getting my mom. 

The drive to my mom’s is about 10-15 minutes, so it wouldn’t take much at all to go get her. 

She told me to try and see this from her side, but all I saw was her getting mad that my mom was coming over. 

She told me that I could get off work a little later than 4pm so I could time it and be able to pick my mom up and then go directly to the school. 

But I already told my boss that I was leaving at 4 and so that’s the time I was going to leave. 

I tried to explain that the timing wouldn’t matter, and that my mom could sit in the driveway and wait until we were ready since she didn’t want her sitting inside. 

She said the timing wouldn’t matter for me, since I was just driving, but that she had 100 things to do and didn’t need an audience. 

We argued about it for a while. I just didn’t understand why I couldn’t get my mom. I kept telling my wife this, but she went on and on about the timing of everything and kept listing all she had to do and asking me to try and see it from her perspective. 

I told her fine, she could just have her way and my mom wouldn’t go. 

But this made my wife even madder, she said that that’s not what she was saying at all. She asked me to come up with a solution instead of arguing because I ‘obviously wasn’t listening’ to her, and I told her that me going to get my mom when I got off work at 4pm was the solution. 

But whatever, my mom just wouldn’t go then. 

I told my wife she could just have her way and that whenever she doesn’t agree with me we fight because she doesn’t get her way. She said that it was the opposite. That if she disagrees with me or brings up her concerns I ignore them or don’t listen.

If that’s the case,  why is she the one always yelling and calling me a selfish asshole?

She then told me that since I need her to be my mother and problem solve for me, she suggested that I go run a quick errand that I’ve been needing to do for a while now, and then after that go pick up my mom and go directly to the school. 

That made sense, so that’s what I did but I just don’t get it. My mom could have easily just sat in our house and waited until we were ready to go. 

My wife also said the house was a mess and the bathroom wasn’t fit for us, let alone any guest right now.

So, this week, I planted a 20 dollar bill before my daughter took her lunch money out. Sure enough, she took it.

I called the police and asked them to come with me to the school so that we could teach my daughter a lesson. Two officers met me there and we pulled my daughter out of class, after which she informed one of the officers that there has been a bully who is stealing her lunch money/forcing my daughter to buy her lunch.  She also has been buying lunch for one of her friends who can not afford it. This was confirmed by both the bully, and the friend.

My daughter was silent on the way home and i informed her that I was just trying to teach her a lesson, that stealing is wrong and can get you in a lot of trouble. and that in the future she needs to speak to myself or her mother if there are issues at school and we would be happy to help her resolve them. 

When we got home, my wife absolutely lost her shit on me, in full tears, telling me that this is a one way ticket to estrangement from our daughter in the future and that we should have just asked her why she was stealing money.  She would have just lied about stealing in the first place so I really don’t understand what her idea of a solution is.

He and his fiancé want my kids (ages 8 and 10) to be the junior bridesmaid and ring bearer. I have no problem with them being that, and the kids are looking forward to it. However, outside that, they will be the only kids there. Outside my kids, they are not really “kid people”. Also, not a big deal to me. I had no kids at my wedding at all-not even for flower girls or ring bearers. 

However, I know my kids. They’re going to get bored if they have to stay for the entire wedding (the ceremony goes into the night). Because this is my brother-in-law’s wedding and my husband is the best man, I am a bridesmaid, we can’t duck out early. Plus, it’s going to be a lot of fun and an excuse to have a few drinks.

My mom lets him come over to our house since apparently that's the ""only way"" he can see his kids since he lives with his mom and she doesn't like having so many people at her house (6 kids.) My mom lets him be in the living room but sometimes he wanders around the house like it's his- ie walking into my brothers room and telling him to clean up. 

Well anyways, he comes over and then asks me to serve him a plate of food because ""my mom doesn't let him,"" even though he always wanders like it's his own home. I've always been taught to ""respect my elders"" by my dad and I kind of feel like that mindset has lead me to some sort of anxiety.

0,"AITA for not giving a single mother a refund | Throwaway account. I’m a videographer in the entertainment industry working mainly with semi famous rappers on music videos and live shows. The people I work with for the most part aren’t rich but do well enough so they can afford rent and have some disposable income. I also have some clients who are flat broke and save for months just to hire me. 

This one rapper, a single mother who is gaining a following hired and paid me $500 to shoot a show. I had her sign a contract which clearly states my refund policy (must give a 72 hour notice for a full refund, 2 days for half refund and less than 48 hours is no refund and you must pay the entire amount agreed upon if not already paid upfront. This applies for any reason) 

This woman canceled on me the day of the show because something was wrong with the venue (I called and verified, they had an electrical problem).  She told me she wanted her money back. I was sympathetic and told her I wouldn’t refund her because I could have booked another event that day but I can give her a discount on the next show. 

She flipped out. Basically said “fuck the contract” and that I need to have sympathy and think of her child and that she could possibly be getting evicted from her apartment and has been eating ramen noodles for a month.  

Now I hate being guilt tripped. She signed the contract, knew what she was getting into and knew my refund policy. I don’t think I should have to forfeit $500 for the sake of a child that I have nothing to do with because of something that is not my fault. 

Now she’s saying she’s gonna take me to court (she won’t even have the time to try filing the suit) Her friends are spamming my Instagram with angry comments and I’ve even gotten some threats of violence. 2 other potential clients said they’re not gonna hire me anymore because I won’t sympathize with a single mother.  

I have lots of other people supporting me in this situation and I know it’s gonna blow over so I’m not worried. But AITA? If I am, I’ll change my refund policy going forward but I’m honoring this contract.

He doesn' tolerate anything he would see as ""less than the best in anything"" around his friends, going as far as stealing (even tho something as cheap as a chocolate bar) just to prove ""he can do whatever he wants and is the coolest for that""

We were at the pool today where he and 2 other friends are trowing water at another friend. When the target (srry, dont know the word) tried to leave, they would pull him back on. Since he was laughing with them, i was only looking, but after a few minutes he started asking them to stop.

Eventually he managed to get out of the ppool but so did my brother and he started to grab the kid to push him back on (for a moment i thought they were fighting)

after a minute repeatedly asking him to stop the kid suddenly drops to the ground and with the cleanest sweep kick my brother falls too. He then mounts on the kid and gives him a neck armlock (again dont know the proprer term sry), and i rushed in to separate them.

Feeling humiliated by a 13yo kid (it was a beautifull sweep), he tried to engage again so i pushed him away. He then comes 5cm from my face and asks ""what are you gonna do? You cant hit me you're 20"", so i push him back and tell him that he will not hit that kid while i'm there. He tries to engage again, i push him again and he come to my face again, now saying he will make him bleed cause he was only joking and the kid took too seriously. He lifts his arms like that bane pose and ask again what am i gonna do

Now i'm a really peacefull guy, but in my mind i couldn't let a kid that wanted nothing but to get along get beaten up for something he repeatedly asked to stop (i've been trough that part) so i slap my brother in the face pretty hard, he goes to the corner (probably to cry) and aventually leaves

I (17F) am currently in my senior year of school.
Friend1 (18F) recently lost her dad to an accidental overdose. Her dad died the morning of a party our whole friend group was meant to attend. Friend2(17F) had no alcohol for this party (I know we're underage but in our country it's 18 not 21). 

Upon hearing about Friend1's dad on our groupchat, she said nothing. Fine. Whatever. That's none of my business. A shit thing to do considering they're close but not my place, I was more preoccupied with trying to make sure Friend1 was ok so I didn't want to bring it up.

Our friend then messaged on this chat asking Friend1 if she was still going to the party and if not could she give her any alcohol she had bought for it. I thought this was absolutely out of order and I messaged her privately and send quite strong messages. I said it was a really cunty thing to do ON the day her dad died. I called her pathetic and said she should be ashamed of herself. This happened last weekend. She left our groupchat. Went to the party and then came to school on Monday and dropped out. She had said repeatedly before that she was only in school this year to hang out with us. 

Friend1 is obviously currently preoccupied with famy stuff and not petty friend drama but she did tell Friend2 to fuck off as well. I spoke to her briefly about it before I messaged privately.

I'm now being blamed by friends of Friend2 who were not in the groupchat for her leaving school. They are saying I helped bully her out of school.

0,"AITA for moving my kids 1.5 hours away from my parents? | TIA for reading.
5 years ago I (33/F) had a bad divorce w/2 small kids. Father is not in the picture and will likely never be, as it stands. I temporarily moved in w/ my parents to get back on my feet. In that time, my parents, kids, and I relocated across the country. Once here, we got a house to share and split everything 50/50. My parents are retired and have not made efforts to branch out. I’ve gotten a grad degree, friends, a great job. After 3 years of being single/focusing on my kids, I began seeing someone >1 year ago. He (35) has a great career, excellent w/my kids, and we’re discussing marriage. In the past months, my boyfriend, kids and I moved in together and we’re happy. 

In the past, there were boundary issues w/ my parents. While my dad let me parent, my mom was very critical. I feel I’m a devoted parent, and other friends/family tell me I do a great job. My mom crosses boundaries often, and it’s been noticed many times by friends & family. She can be controlling and is used to us abiding. (An example would be calling me “crazy” and being very upset that I took the kids on vacation 5 hours away. They had a blast.) 

Now, an opportunity has presented for my boyfriend & I to relocate to a smaller town 1.5 hours away. My boyfriend is successful in a unique line of work that’s very geographically limited, and has turned down offers to live abroad, petitioning for a location closer to where we are now so my kids can stay close to family. This move is not entirely optional for him to maintain his position. My job is flexible. The town has good schools, is safer and easier living. The kids are excited and had no concerns re: seeing their grandparents less days per week. (My parents would go from seeing the kids before/after school to on the weekends.) 

I broke the news to my family & they are furious. I assured them we’d be back to the city almost all weekends, and they could visit any time. They told me they never would’ve moved here if they knew we’d be an hour & a half away, they were “devastated” and felt “used and abused”.

I never would’ve accepted their help if I knew I’d be expected to live within a certain radius indefinitely. I feel like I owe them for their support when I was going through the worst time of my life. I love my parents & will be forever grateful for their help. Right now, their weekday revolves around the kids, they don’t have hobbies/friends/ jobs so I know it’s an adjustment. I feel this is the best move for us, the kids, our careers, & peace of mind. I see a future w/ my boyfriend, he fought to be close to us, and is committed to me & 2 kids that aren’t biologically his. AITA for relocating?",False,False

I got into a huge fight with my fiancé and got kicked out. I am extremely grateful that Megan is letting me stay with her while I figure things out with my fiancé and get back on my feet.

This morning I wanted to invite Megan out to lunch as a thank you. I went into her room to ask her and saw a huge ass spider on her bed just chilling. I screamed so loud I’m surprised I didn’t shatter every glass within a 10 mile radius and immediately grabbed the nearest object to kill it. 

And then I squished it.

Megan ran out of the bathroom when I screamed and saw what happened. To my surprise she started crying! Apparently she had the spider out so she could clean its enclosure and it was her pet. It was also a very rare and exotic species that cost her a lot of money (hundreds of dollars).

She is extremely upset with me and is asking me to pay her for the spider. I am refusing because I feel like 1) there was NO way I could’ve know this was her pet and I had a normal human reaction and 2) she left her spider just chilling there and that’s on her.

1,"AITA for asking my girlfriend to pay the vet bill and replace her own belongings after she almost killed my dog? | In brackets/italics at the end of each paragraph is what my girlfriend thinks I should add. The asshole will be paying the vet bill/replacing her stuff.

My girlfriend (19) and I (23) have been dating for 4 months. She often stays at my place since we live 45 minutes away and she doesn't drive, so when I pick her up for dates it often gets late so we just crash at my place. Sometimes this results in her staying for a few days since I work. [*She says she would rather go on dates in her town and go home at the end of the night, but that I always make reservations at places close to me and then am too tired to drive her home and won't get up early enough before work to take her home, sometimes meaning she's at my place for days in a row unintentionally and gets stuck in my room the whole time since my roommate doesn't like visitors.*]

Today she called my place of work asking to speak to me saying my dog had just eaten a couple of her prescription medications and she had already called the vet and they said it was a lethal amount and the dog had to be brought in. She told me her mom was there and they'd drive her to the vet, but to meet them there. 

The vet ended up giving my dog medicine to vomit, except she wouldn't vomit there and waited until she was in my car (when me, girlfriend, and the dog were driving back to my place-- her mom went home) to unload everywhere. She is okay now. I asked my girlfriend what happened and she said that when her mom arrived (which I had no knowledge of and totally wouldn't have been okay with her having people over without me there) the dog would not stop barking and lunging for the door. My girlfriend has repeatedly said the dog isn't safe which just isn't true, so she locked the dog in our bedroom. Apparently while her mom was visiting, the dog chewed and destroyed all her things-- purse, clothing, bag of toiletries, etc.. [*While she accepts nothing bad has ever happened, she doesn't feel the dog is safe since she will lunge and growl and she doesn't feel strong enough to keep control over the dog. She thought putting her in a room was the safest way to handle things. Her mom was there to bring her medicine and food, since I don't keep food at my place and don't want her eating my roommates things. She also says I'm only mad about her mom visiting because I don't like her.*]

Not only did my girlfriend refuse to clean up the vomit, but she won't pay me back for the vet bill and is asking me to pay half toward replacing her items. I think it's just crazy because if she didn't have her mom over without my permission, none of this would have happened. I ended up cleaning up the vomit, but the vet bill and cost of replacing her stuff (estimated to be $650 total) is up in the air.",False,False

1,"AITA for insulting my cheating ex over the fact her father left her as a child? | Hi, this is a throwaway as I don’t want this linked to my main account. Apologies for mobile formatting yada yada.

So I’ll get right into it. I (19m) go to a top university in the UK. I am a second year and live with my ex girlfriend (19f) and 3 of our mutual friends. This came about because in my first year, I started dating my now ex near the start of Uni and we all decided to live together for second year. Near the end of the year she cheated on me by sleeping with some random bloke she’d pulled in a club. I confronted her and broke it off. 

Fast forward to September and the arrangement is now very awkward as we’re not on speaking terms, yet share a house. There is a lot of tension and mutual dislike in the air. She has done a lot of petty things so far this year which I won’t get into, but safe to say she’s pissed off everyone in the house and there are arguments almost daily. 

Well a couple of nights ago I was coming back from a night out with my friends at around 2 or 3am, and it’s possibly important here to note that she doesn’t have any friends at university, whereas I am involved in several societies, was always the ‘popular’ social butterfly of our house, go out multiple times a week etc and that this was always a point of contention during our relationship as, though she didn’t like to admit it, she was always jealous. 

I went into the kitchen to fill up a bottle of water. I’m quite drunk at this point. Well lo and behold she is in there and turns to me to say something along the lines of ‘drunk again?’ With a smirk and belittled me for enjoying myself. I said it’s not my fault she’s a loner and that nobody likes her, we argued a bit about cleaning and other household issues. She then says that at least Adam liked her and that’s why she cheated because he was better than me, which really pissed me off.

I mention how lonely it must be to have no friends and family being so far away and ask if she heard me the other night with a girl I’d brought home. She said she’s glad she hurt me and asked if I’ve mentally recovered. She knew I had on and off mental health issues while we dated. Which was the final straw as I had further mental health issues for most of that summer as a direct result of her. I said to her, shouting, ‘at least my daddy didn’t fucking leave me when I was 5, if he could see you now he’d leave all over again you dirty little cunt.’

She burst out crying and ran from the kitchen. She had her mum pick her up the next day, and I haven’t seen her since. My housemates, who already dislike her are on my side. My friends and family are also on my side for the most part. 
I knew her insecurities from our time together and said the most hurtful thing I could muster, specifically targeting what I knew would cause the most pain and distress and probably took it too far, so while I hate her, I’m aware I’m probably in the wrong, though remorse still eludes me.

However after these last four months, I’ve realized that I love my girls and our family as is. I am perfectly happy with two kids and do not want another.

​A half hour later (2 hours after ordering), I called back and a woman answered. She said that they were very busy and that the driver had left with 3 orders (no apology).

​I waited another half hour (2.5 hours after ordering) and called back. By now the pizzeria is closing in 20 minutes. I call 16 times and no answer. At one point, they pick up the phone and hang up (probably because the phone was ringing continuously and doesn't go to an answering machine). Finally, they must have taken the phone off the hook, because I got busy signal until 11 p.m., when they closed.

​I think that they owed me an explanation about my food. If you know that there is a late order still undelivered, you shouldn't be closing up and you should be trying your best to reassure me that my food was coming (by having the driver call me or something).

​Finally, I was fed up and lost hope of my food coming. I cancelled my order through Grubhub and ordered somewhere else.

At around 3 hours after I placed the order, and after I had already cancelled the order and ordered somewhere else, the driver calls me to tell me he is outside. I told him I didn't want it because it was late and is probably cold (not to mention I had ordered elsewhere and had cancelled that order).

He makes about as much as I do yet always seems to be broke despite never buying groceries or paying rent (for the record, I do not pay rent either, which is why I have been able to build up the fund, but I do buy most of my own groceries, as well as pay for all my makeup, health supplies, phone and uni fees).

0,"AITA for not wanting to live with my cousin after my mother passed away? | First of all sorry for the broken english, is not my first language (F, 21).


On september of 2018 my mom was diagnosed with stomachal cancer at stage four. The two of us lived in the capital of my country, I’m her only daughter and my father passed away 19 years ago, since then my mom was single and my closer family, my aunt and my grandma, live four hours south of us. In the beginning they traveled once a month to see my mom, they even spent christmas and new years with us that year, and it was great to feel the support of my family at that time. 


Sadly my mom didn’t take her diagnosis really well and i had to start making decisions for the economic well being of the two of us, because cancer is a fucking expensive disease, such as having to move from a big and well located apartment to a smaller one in a modest part of the city that was just big enough to fit my mom, me and a spare bed cause i thought they would come to visit, but in 2019 through all the period of time that i would go with my mom to chemos, hospitalized and everything I was alone with her.


They basically disappeared, my grandma came to visit every 2 months but my aunt literally disappeared, of course she would call me and tell me to go visit her but i was a nineteen year old woman taking care of her sick mother, the economy of the house and going to med school, so i didn’t have any time of energy to travel to visit her. 
Through all this process i talked to them several times saying that i couldn’t do it alone but my aunt told me that it was really difficult for her travel to see me. Even though they travelled to shop several times in the capital, coming for the day and didn’t even talking to me. I just got to know they were here because of social media.
By the end of the year i was exhausted, and was struggling so hard with my mental and physical health.


On december of 2019 my mom passed away, and i started to take decisions such as with who i was going to live based on economic and personal things, and i decided to live with my boyfriend with whom i’ve been with for more than 3 years cause i don’t want to live alone. I’m independent in terms of money since i got an insurance paid and i can sustain myself until i graduate med school

But in January of this year, one month after my mother passed away, my aunt called me and asked me if my cousin (M, 18) could live with me cause he is starting  college in my city, and i said no cause i don’t want to be in charge of someone after the year i’ve been gone through, after feeling so alone and overwhelmed with everything.
After that answer she told me that it wasn’t going to be like that, that she didn’t want him to be alone, that i could teach him how to move around the city, and that sounded to me to taking care of someone and i stood with my decision of saying no.
I have seen her a couple of times after that talk and recently she told me that she was really hurt by the decision i made because family is above my boyfriend and stuff like that.

1,"AITA: I willingly neglect my spanish to spanish speakers. | I am a person that was raised and taught that if you go to another place you have to adapt, including the language. I was raised to learn 4 languages and honestly that messed up my processing of wording in the long term during elementary and middle school (Thanks Father). But nevertheless it is something that helped me get connections. Now even though I was never very connected to the hispanic side of my bloodline, I kept family connections and when I decided to move to the United states when I became a mormon I sough to take an uncle of mine's offer. Over years through teenhood and later on adulthood my uncle and aunt helped me a lot to gather myself and become independent. Now the hispanic community in highschool and beginnings of University were very warming, very family oriented and I became very comfortable with it as many of my friendships were hispanic. But over the last few years I have witnessed some harsh entitlement over the same community. As if instead of trying to ask if someone speaks spanish before, now it becomes more of a demanding request. I even heard one of my friendships complain when we went to a restaurant about why they didn't have a spanish speaker on the clock. It made cringe and also become completely offended. I couldn't help myself but distance myself from that idea and eventually at one of my jobs, as I interacted in customer service with many spanish speakers that were nice, the entitled and harsh ones would always out do the nicer ones by one against 5 or 7. It was like they were reproducing. One day I had enough and just took a deep breath and decided to stop speaking spanish. I avoided it for years. And whenever I would see people on that job start asking for me to speak I would swallow my desire and just answer back ""I don't speak spanish miss/sir"" Over time I developed a bit of a jerky tone with that when people out of nowhere just rambled in spanish to me not even asking if I spoke spanish. Mind you I don't look hispanic. A lot of people say I do look european but honestly I just thing I look more armenian or middle eastern because of my facial structure (Thanks mother). With people like this I would just stare at them firmly and ask with a firm ""what was that?"" if they changed back to english I would pretty much help gladly, but if the rambling continued with that demanding tone I would just keep the ""I don't speak spanish"" I am done with customer service now but from now and then I still encounter people around that do this and I respond the same way.

Recently, a parakeet smashed into our back window. We took him inside, and because we used to own birds we put him in a cage.

We tried to call around our neighborhood for the bird, and all the people thought it was this one neighbor who had alot of birds, because they always saw their kids playing with them, so we called them and they couldn't bother to pick up the phone, my step father even knocked on their door and they didn't answer.

The bird, a violet, male parakeet, was recently registered under our name because we took him to the vet for a small Crack in his beak which the smash caused. Hes alright now.

Bringing him to a shelter right now is definitely not the best option, he would most likely be put down because the shelter cannot afford some pets like this in this you know what sickness situation. 

Nobody has come forward with owning the bird yet, and the reason why I'm tying this is because my girlfriend (who doesn't live with us) always gets snappy when i mention the bird, and asked ""why are you even keeping him, he isn't yours."" in a rude tone.

I asked her parents last year if she went to the gym, and they said she didn’t. Thus, I bought her a two-year 24 Hour Fitness membership from Costco for $700 for her 19th birthday. Since it was an expensive gift that lasts two years, I joked that I won’t be getting her a present for her 20th birthday.

After the accident, my neck was very tight and I was considering going to the doctor over the next few days if the pain didn't go away. My sister calls to make a claim and I made sure to have her let the insurance agent know that I was having neck pain. My sister told me that her neck hurt too, but not as bad as mine did.

Now, a few days later, I get a call from the other person's insurance company asking for details. I told them that my neck is better, I'm just a little sore. They offered a decent amount as a settlement, although not a large amount (I don't think the actual dollar value is relevant). I figured I should accept because I'm feeling much better and the soreness is almost gone. So we proceeded with that. I then let my sister know about their settlement offer because I was going to see if they offered her one as well. Turns out she didn't let them know that she was hurt, because she didn't think it was too serious.

Now she thinks that she should get some of the money they offered me because she was in the accident as well.

Neither him nor I pay rent, but I pay for my own school and much of my own living expenses, in addition to contributions to the household like helping with groceries and items for around the house such as Kleenex, paper towels, or q-tips.

My brother is taking online courses which in his own words are 'very cheap' and he works 4 days a week. He barely buys his own stuff, let alone for the household. My mom buys his soap, food, bus passes, etc. He even tries to eat my food I've labeled 'NoNo' (as in 'No Noelle (my name)' - don't eat). It really pisses me off that he eats my food, takes my stuff & doesn't contribute anything. I'm fed up with it. I've brought it up to my mom several times and she always says ""I know"" or ""I can't make him contribute"" or ""I don't want to cause an argument.""

I buy q-tips to help me apply my makeup. No one else tends to use them as my parents say they're not good to stick in your ears. The other day, my brother said his ears 'felt dirty' and did we have any q-tips. I said no. Later he went into the bathroom and saw q-tips sitting in my makeup drawer. He asked if I'd forgotten I had them. I said no I hadn't but I didn't want to share them. He was like 'um excuse me.' I told him he needs to start buying his own toiletries and food and start contributing to the house more, and that it's not fair we have to buy things to support him too. He works, and frankly makes more money than me yet has less expenses because his schooling is barely $400/semester vs my upwards of $4000. 

He freaked out on me and said I'm a selfish bitch for not letting him use q-tips of all things, and that I wouldn't act this way with mom or dad. I said he was correct, because mom and dad and I have a nice, reciprocal relationship where we all buy things to share. Sometimes my mom will buy chips and wine for us all, then I'll go to the grocery store and pickup the fixings for pizza for dinner, etc. I told him it would probably be best if he became a part of the reciprocation rather than taking all the time.

1,"AITA for getting mad at my friend for not moving in when I'm abroad? | A year ago I decided that I wanted to spend the 5th semester of my bachelor's degree in London. I am leaving for London in 9 days. I have a rather big apartment back home where I already have 2 roommates. I've always known that when I leave for London I would have to find a third resident. 6 months ago my very close friend came to me, and asked very politely if he could move in when I leave. The two other roommates were not my friends prior to moving in so they don't know the actual rent. They pay a rather low rent for the average rent in the area but they actually pay 80% of the rent where I pay the remaining 20%. I pay for everything else in the apartment and it is my apartment on paper too. I figured I was gonna get a third roommate who would pay the same amount as the other two, so I would have more money for London.

My friend however knows how much I pay, and he asked if he could move in and pay the 20%. Both he and I have always been bad with saving up money and I knew he really needed a lower rent so I agreed on a few conditions. I wanted him to take over the room with my furniture so I didn't have too pay for them to be stored. He agreed. I also didn't want to stress about the move because that was the last thing I needed. He knew I was doing him a favor so he went along.

I have been rather stressed and in a terrible mental condition ever since and just really need to leave for London for a fresh start. He knows this. We both smoke way too much weed, and I want to get away from that. A month ago he got a new job that pays a lot better. Now he wants to stay at his current apartment and not move in at my place. At first I was furious. He came to me because he needed my help and now he doesn't want it. I calmed down and told him that I would still like to continue with our deal because it really suits me. He would still pay a very very low rent, live in a better area and in a bigger apartment. He told me he would move in if I didn't find anyone else. I never looked for anyone else as I was very comfortable with our agreement. He has now told me he won't move in and I am very pissed but am trying to avoid confrontation.

Over the past few months, every time we have done a bank run there has been one particular teller who has been unneccessarily rude to me and also the other staff, even going so far as making one girl cry.

My uncle said hello to us but other than that completely ignored us (we were all sitting around a table).

I knew I'd put on weight already and didn't need it pointed out.

I usually try to change the subject but now that we're engaged shes become a lot more hostile to both me and my best friend.

What really pissed me off is that she almost drove my best friend to tears recently over dinner, basically indirectly criticizing her for always hanging around someone elses man instead of finding her own.

I confronted my fiance in private and she just asked me to not invite her to the wedding. I put my foot down and said that I love her, and that the type of relationship i have with her comes once in a lifetime.

He then said, “I’m actually engaged.” There was an awkward silence. We said goodbye and left. Now it’s the summer, and I just started interning at the hospital. I saw him last Friday doing an orientation. I went over and said Hi to him, and he said hello back. We had a short conversation, and I asked him if he wanted to do lunch on Monday. He said he will “get back to me” by the weekend.

Well the weekend passed and he didn’t say anything. I figured his fiancee didnt let him attend. Kind of controlling but whatever. I saw him again this morning, and asked about lunch. He said he can’t make it because of a “prior commitment”. I laughed and joked, “Your fiancee doesnt have to know.” He did not find it funny. He then made an excuse to leave and was kind of rude about it.

I felt really awkward afterwards. Also a bit annoyed that he responded so weirdly to an innocent joke. AITA? Or is he overreacting?",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting to go to a friend’s wedding ceremony after not being invited to the reception | Hey, my friend is due to get married this weekend and I was invited to both the ceremony and reception, however a couple of days ago we were gaming and I said I was looking forward to it and he paused and then said ‘sorry I sent you the wrong invite, it’s only the ceremony you can come to as I haven’t got enough space at the reception’. I didn’t really mind as if quite a laidback person but I’m not sure if I should go to the ceremony as I feel it might be awkward, especially when other friends of his who are also my friends will be there and then heading to reception straight after. I’ve known him for around 10 years yet people he’s known less have been invited to the reception - after I secured a job and got into a relationship I didn’t really get time to see my friends as often as I’d like to have. Either way, I’m in two minds whether to go or not, I don’t get how he could send the wrong invite?

0,"AITA for not wanting my toddler around my in-laws? | THROW AWAY ACCOUNT. Background: my husband (26) and I (25) have been together for almost eight years (married for 4) and his parents have never liked me. His mom would try to convince him to date other girls, say snide things to me about my weight, make fun of me for not liking to be touched, disregarding things I have said, etc. while his dad straight up refused to acknowledge my existence to the point refusing to speak to me or even look at me. I know they spoke poorly of me to the rest of his family or didn't mention me at all because on my wedding day (which they refused to speak to me at), I had a distant aunt ask who I was because MIL told her he was marrying his ex-girlfriend. I'm not quite sure why they've never liked me, but I always assumed it was because they preferred this ex instead of me.

&#x200B;

About a year after the wedding, we announced that I was pregnant (intentionally) and suddenly it switched from FIL never acknowledging me, to only acknowledging the baby and MIL becoming WAY too involved.

&#x200B;

It has only gotten worse since I've given birth. Any time they have watched our son, he has come home with severe diaper rash, hasn't been fed all day, hasn't slept the entire time he was there, or was wrapped in a cat pee-soaked blanket. I understand that they are not his parents and should not be required to take care of our child, but these events occurred after they specifically asked to watch him. There have even been incidents of my FIL feeding him foods that he is allergic to, and when I told him to stop he told my son ""oh no, mom caught us, mom's the bad guy. Can't have fun with her around."" Unfortunately, it seems that every time my son is at their house, something like this happens and my toddler suffers because of it. It is to the point where he is not allowed to be at their house unsupervised for his safety.

&#x200B;

My husband feels like he is stuck in the middle of this because his parents refuse to listen to my concerns and they refuse to speak to me. My only concern is for my child's health and well-being. I've told him that if he was being treated this way at a daycare, we would remove him immediately, so why is it okay for him to be treated this way at his grandparents' house? My husband is struggling because he feels like he can't turn his back on his family and he wants his son to know his grandparents, but he is worried about what could happen to him if he is left alone.

&#x200B;

To clarify, any time they want to see our son, my husband makes sure they have time together, but that it is supervised, they are never refused visits, but they always seem to try to push him out of the house so they can be alone with my son. I don't necessarily think they are intentionally abusive, I think it is more just negligence or just ignorance?

&#x200B;

I worry I may be the asshole for keeping my son from his grandparents, but I’m conflicted.

1,"AITA For going on my best friend's dream trip and not inviting her? | Me and Mandy have been best friends since basically kindergarten, and almost since then she's been fascinated with Turkey, Croatia, and the Balkans/Mediterranean region in general. 

I started dating a guy from a Balkan country and was making plans to go visit him and his family, and while doing so I found this AMAZING package deal that lets you travel the Balkans, Spain, Greece, Turkey and Morocco. Seriously, it was like a once in a lifetime deal and though it's pretty expensive, it's WAY cheaper than it would be to find places to stay and travel to those places on your own.

I KNEW Mandy couldn't afford it, and I KNEW it would hurt her deeply that she wasn't getting a chance to go. This trip is literally what she dreams of doing, and with me in particular, but she's been in a lot of financial trouble lately. So I told her I was planning a trip, but not any of the details. I also told another very close friend about the trip, and she looked up the same deal and decided she wanted to go as well. I said I'd love to have the company, so she bought her tickets and she's coming along too. I realized that if Mandy heard about this or found out about this before I got a chance to tell her she'd be super hurt, so I told her about the trip. 

She was SOOOOOOO upset. She asked about why I didn't invite her, and I told her it was because I knew she couldn't afford it and I thought it would just be salt in the wound. (I also privately think she would have made some very questionable decisions in order to fund the trip, or would have gone and then not had enough for money, or her bills, or things like that at home.) That just made it worse, and she cried, and cried about how we always said we'd go and experience those places together, and that I don't even have any interest in the region, which is pretty much true since I want to travel around Asia. I told her we could still go that in the future, and we could even do this trip in the future, but she was too hurt to want to hear that. 

My boyfriend thinks I am being kind of a dick, and says for his best friend, he'd have offered to pay for part to help if he could, and I guess I \*could\* but not super comfortably and idk when she'd pay me back. He also thinks she'd have been less hurt if I brought it up while I was thinking about it. My other friend agrees that it was a good idea to wait to tell her since she agrees Mandy probably would have done ANYTHING to go on that trip.",False,False
1,"AITA for blasting my subwoofers in my own parking spot during non quiet hours at my apartment complex? | Posting from a throwaway for whatever reason, just don't want this to blend into my other subs.

So basically my car is my life. I have a tuned Subaru Impreza WRX STI that is my hobby, my transportation, my life, I'm more comfortable behind the wheel than I am in my own bed. Its not quite as fast as I want it but it looks amazing and the sound system is seriously as good as it can be.

I live in a large apartment complex in Tucson, I'm guessing probably 100 units or so. Not sure. Anyways the complex is really cool because a lot of places won't let you work on your car, well I can pay an extra premium every month to get a mechanics spot under shade. It's an extra 2 bills a month but so worth it. 

When I work on my car I BLAST my system. It helps me think and focus. Also important to note our complex has quiet hours between and 10pm and 8am, I follow these to the letter but I do need to work on my car so some Saturday's and Sunday's I crank shit from 8:01am to 9:59pm. I am not breaking any rules at all.

I moved in in January and this Sunday was apparently a major problem. I had two people ask me to turn it down. I totally did but one came back and said its not the volume, it's the bass, can I turn the bass down. I said I would try but I guess that wasn't good enough because he came down a third time. Finally I told him I paid for the spot, I wasn't breaking any rules, I'd only be out there until 10pm. He said his kids had to go to bed at 8:30 and the bass from my car was rattling his walls. I told him I'd done my best to accommodate him but I was done. He told me he'd call the police (who never showed) and talk to management. I just stopped responding to him and cranked my system to drown our his barking. I worked on my car until 9:59 when I turned my system off.

I got an email from my apartment manager asking if she could come by. She's really cool and I want to help her but I feel like I'm paying extra for the mechanics spot, I'm not breaking any rules and that guy had no right to talk to me like that. She said she managed a nice place and she's gotten complaint after complaint about my car. I told her I was sorry but I was still well within my rights and not breaking rules. She asked me to please consider for her sake using headphones Or earbuds if music is that important to me. I said I'd try,

I worked on my car all night last night and used ear buds and it just wasn't the same. I spent thousands of dollars and so much time to tune my system perfectly and to not use it when I want sucks. I want to help her out but am I even being an asshole in the first place?",False,False
0,"AITA for not pitching for my partners child support payments? | I (31F) have been dating partner (38M) for about 7 years. He has a daughter (10F) that I have a great relationship with, I really love being a step-mom. Not every step-parent relationship is the same so I’ll just say I’m very involved, I take her to soccer practice, go to every game I am able to make wrt work schedules,  we do those mud run obstacle courses, I taught her how to read and we’ve been reading some of my childhood favourites together, I have a good relationship with her mom too and am usually the one who does pick up-drop off when we swap houses.

Money wise, while I do make a more $$ than my partner, slightly more than 1/3 of my salary is allocated to my student loan payments/car payments etc. He and his brother own the house and while they put 750 each/month into the “house account” I pay 400 (last night agreed to increase to 450). I do most of the groceries and also pitch 50/50 for all of her sports/activities, pitch for clothes, shoes, birthday parties, camping trips, weekends away all that stuff. 

It’s hard not to get into the weeds about the money but he sees the mortgage as a way to buy us a future once we can afford to live separately from his brother, but I don’t feel I can make a bigger contribution to the house account because I’m having a hard time affording my loans (I returned to school for a technical diploma while living with partner/brother & step-daughter). I probably could have gotten more ahead of them if I didn’t have the added responsibility of caring for my stepdaughter but I really want her to have the best life and get as many experiences as we can provide for her.

The problem is any time we get into an argument (about chores or money) he always argues that I should be paying for the mortgage and pitching for the child support payments, he went as far as to say that I was choosing to be a mom only when it was convenient for me because I wasn’t paying support. I think that comment makes him TA, but he thinks I’m TA because I don’t pay child support and match his mortgage payments.",False,False
1,"AITA for taking an unvaccinated child to a friends birthday when she asked for no unvaccinated people? | Ok so here’s the thing. My friends daughter is unvaccinated, it’s her choice and I respect that, and also it’s not the daughters fault. So the daughter was staying with us at the weekend because her parents suddenly had to go away and one of my daughters school friends had a party on Saturday. The mother of the child’s who’s party it was had asked that no one unvaccinated come because she was worried for her Newborn baby after the recent measles outbreak. I asked the mom if my daughters friend could come to the party with her as we were looking after her and she said that was fine. I didn’t mention she was unvaccinated. It didn’t really even come to my mind until just before we were leaving and I looked at the invitation again, I decided to ignore it and take her anyone. The child is very healthy and had no signs of illness. We got to the party and everything was fine until about an hour into it and the mother asks to speak to me. One of the other moms who knew the little girl who was with us knew that her mom was anti vaccine. So she asked me if the child was vaccinated and I said I wasn’t sure. She asked me to find out for sure so I pretended to text her mom and then I told the mother that she wasn’t vaccinated. She asked us to leave and now she’s very angry at me for bringing her. My daughter and his little girl were very confused at why we had to leave and honestly I think she made a massive deal out of nothing.

0,"AITA for wanting to cut my sister out of my life? | So I have a sister who is 10 years older than I am. She’s 32. And we all live in the same house but I don’t think I can be part of her life anymore. She’s probably one of the most manipulative people I’ve ever met and has consistently made me feel horrible my whole life even though I’ve done significantly more for her than she has for me. She has a daughter who I love a lot. And I basically helped raise her since I was 11. But I can’t be a “mom” anymore. My older sister just expects me to take care of her daughter and do every little thing for her. She’s taken advantage of me for so long. And I let her. She’s put me down a lot. For not wearing makeup. For being ten pounds heavier than she is. For not doing enough for her. For not making her food when she wants. For never being enough. For having feelings. But today she drew the line after getting in an argument with me and at one point I called her a bitch. She sent me oodles of essays via text. I apologized for calling her that and for what happened during the fight but then she continued to put me down and blame me for her problems. She kept telling me I wasn’t really “sorry.” I realize I could’ve been better during the argument but she insisted she was the only one who was calm. She was not calm and yelled at me at one point and didn’t let me finish what I was saying. That was the point when I got up and went to my room. 

I did stop talking to her at one point in my life to an extent, but decided to give her another chance to see if she would maybe listen to what I have to say or if she could try and understand that it’s never been easy being her sister. Or trying to talk to her. Talking to her is the most difficult thing I’ve had to do because she doesn’t treat me like a sister. I’m just someone she needs when it’s convenient or someone who is easy to manipulate. 

Anytime we get into a disagreement or if I tell her she is doing something wrong she goes off on me and then the next day pretends it never happened and wants a “clean slate.” I prefer to talk through things so there isn’t tension or anxiety for me. Pretending things never happened is my number one pet peeve and causes my anxiety to be worse. 

Would it really be bad to cut her out of my life other than formalities and interactions with my niece? I know “family is family” but I have friends who feel more like family than she ever has. I don’t know if this is where I should post this but I needed to get this off my chest. I don’t know. I just wish she could try and understand where I’m coming from. She never listens and I’m tired of trying to get her to listen when I only ever get cut off.

1,"AITA for mis-translating for my old coworker who feels it’s ok to only speak Spanish? | So I have a coworker, an older lady from Central America. She only speaks Spanish and that’s very annoying to me. For one her Spanish sounds stupid to me, and even though I am bilingual I have to stop for a second and really try to piece together what she is saying. She speaks that crappy Central American Spanish.

Anyway lately she’s been coming to me and asking me to translate for her to other people. That bothers me, and I had finally had enough.

She came to me and asked if I could get translate something for her. I agreed, but I said the exact opposite of what she said. In short she said she needed more time to finish a certain project and I told the person that she said she was done and ready for inspection. So they came and checked up on her, and she was nowhere near finished. Our boss was a bit upset and yelled at her and she started to cry.

0,"WIBTA if I wore an above knee length dress to thanksgiving with religious family | This year I am hosting thanksgiving because I just bought a house so it’ll be a housewarming party as well. Also it’ll be a chance for some of my extended family to meet my husband for the first time. The thing about my family is about half of my extended family are Muslim. And pretty devout. However I am atheist and so is my husband. After I stoped being Muslim when I was a teenager my family would always continue to push their beliefs on to me and force me to pretend I was still Muslim when we were around other Muslim friends and family to keep them comfortable and not offend them. I would usually go along with some of it and dress modestly and go to them to the mosque or non denominational churches and just keep my lack of belief quiet. Mostly because I was a kid and lived with my parents or when I was in college, still depended on their financial help. 

Now I’m 24 year old married woman. I have a career, my own home, everything is on my own now so I don’t want to keep pretending with them and making myself uncomfortable for the sake of their beliefs. Why is ok for them to be comfortable but not me? Why is ok for them to push their religion on me but I have to be quiet about not believing in anything? 

I feel like I should be able to wear whatever I want in my own home regardless of who is coming. I am still on loving and good terms with my family but they will get upset if I wear a dress that isn’t to my ankles. (We live in hot muggy Florida). If I wear it they’ll try and defer to my husband and tell him to control me and make me dress modestly and that would force him to back me up and might put him in a bad spot with my family. 

Anyways my husband said just to give in for the sake of respecting them and it’s only one day but I’m tired of it. It’s more personal for me to stand up to them and dress how I want. Plus it’s not like I’m going to be naked or wear booty shorts and a low cut shirt or see through clothes. It’s a normal above the knee length dress for fall time. 

WIBTA if I wore the dress or not. 

TLDR: my family is devout Muslim and would have a problem with me wearing secular clothing even though thanksgiving is at my house and I am atheist. Should I wear what I want or give in and let them control me.",False,False
1,"AITA for trash-talking someone I haven't even talked to in months? | Okay, so there's this girl named Gray. Gray was an absolute thorn in my side for a whole semester. We were roommates and she was very unbearable in that happy-go-lucky-the-world-
is-wonderful-let-me-help-you-
fix-your-life kind of way. She was constantly on my case for missing class and staying up late because she made it her personal mission to ""fix"" my life even though my life is already pretty fine and I'm happy with the kind of student I am. She'd do things like call me a bad student and a bad influence in public, constantly try to hug me or touch my face even after I made it clear I really hated that, and basically just shame every decision I made even though it was really none of her business what I did or didn't do outside of our dorm room.

There were a lot of other little things that bothered me like some boundary issues and annoying habits that she had. The thing is that Gray isn't a bad person, she just gets on my nerves so I kept my distance as much as possible.

At the end of the semester people started looking for new roommates and a lot of my friends came up to me to ask me what living with Gray was like and I was honest and told them about all the little things that she does that bothered me, personally. They all took my word and by the end Gray was desperate because no one would room with her anymore.

after that I haven't had much contact with her but every now and then someone I like will bring her up and I always end up telling them about the annoying things she does. I never make stuff up or lie and I try not to exaggerate it, but I don't want to lie and pretend like she's wonderful.

Anyways now I'm thinking that maybe it's a little unfair of me to scare people away from Gray just because I can't stand her. Like in my mind I'm just saving them the trouble of getting to know her before the crazy pops out but now I'm thinking that maybe it's none of my business what my friends think of her and I need to just keep my mouth shut.

If this helps at all I know a lot of other people that also can't stand her, so I'm inclined to believe that I'm not just making the whole thing up in my mind,she's actually annoying.

1,"AITA for refusing to kick a drunk guy out of my house after he supposedly harassed a girl? | I threw a party at my place Friday night. My girlfriend had one of her long time friends “Kim” in the city visiting and I invited a bunch of my guy friends while my girlfriend and her friend had a bunch of their friends over. 

The night was a lot of fun until at one point one of my best friends “Pete” was super wasted when we were out clubbing. By this point I had told Pete that he could stay at my house because he was too drunk and I wanted to make sure he would be safe. Kim had also been staying at our house for the past few days at that point. 

When we get home, my girlfriend pulls me aside and tells me that Kim told her that while we were out at the club, Pete was acting super aggressive towards her, attempted to grab her a few times while we were dancing, even after she turned him down. She said that at one point he attempted to stop her from leaving the bathroom by putting his arm up but she pushed him off and walked away. I didn’t see any of this, let me make that clear. My girlfriend told me that Kim didnt want Pete to stay the night at our place because she “doesn’t feel safe” with him there. 

I told my girlfriend that I didn’t want to kick Pete out because I didn’t see anything that happened and he was drunk and just being an idiot and if I kicked him out I wasn’t at all confident that he would make it home in one piece. 

She told me that I was prioritizing my friend and his behaviour over the comfort and safety of Kim. I said that wasn’t the case but because I didn’t see what or if anything happened that I wasn’t going to kick a super drunk guy out in the middle of the night and nothing was going to happen that night. She got pissed at me and told me to sleep on the floor in the living room. 

In the morning, Pete left early before any of us were awake as he had to make a drive to his parents house so I didn’t get to talk to him. When my girlfriend woke up she was still pissed at me and said that I should’ve listened to her and that I’m “part of the problem.”

0,"AITA for cutting off my father for not paying for my college tuition? | 18 y/o high school senior here. My mom's been abused basically her entire life, including by my dad, and when I was seven my dad started to threaten her with death if she didn't divorce him and move back to the US. He took all of our money so she didn't finish the divorce entirely as we had to flee to live with her parents before we were totally broke. My dad accused her of kidnapping (even though he knew we were leaving), dragged her through US federal and circuit courts, and she was acquitted and got custody. However, he also received mandatory visitation, mandatory phone calls/contact, had to pay no alimony or settlements, and only pays minimal child support ($300/month).

As I've grown up, he and his family have continually denied that any of the abuse happened. His entire extended family insists my mom poisoned me and lied to me even though I witnessed and remember this abuse. However, aside from this, they do try to be good family, paying for flights to visit them, buying me clothes, etc, but their denial of these events really bothers me. Besides, even with a generous estimate of how much they pay (including child support) the amount they contribute still doesn't really cover the cost of raising a child, which my mom's parents have pretty much covered while my mom has been trying to recover from her trauma and find a stable job. My dad and his new wife on the other hand are very well-off, spending a lot of money on private school and expensive clothes for his other kids.

Now, I got into my dream school, and my dad is insisting that if he pays for my college (asking for $15,000 for the first year, even less after that if I become an RA and get the scholarships I applied for), I have to visit with him and his family more and start to distance myself from my mother, which is a non-negotiable for me. My mother is everything to me. He won't acknowledge any of the abuse he perpetrated against her for the eight years they were together, calling both me and her a liar. He keeps criticizing my mom and her parents for not being able to pay more for my college education, and calls my mother a ""lazy"" woman who is the ""source of all of my anxiety"" and has poisoned me.

0,"AITA For disowning my cousin (who's also my wife's best friend) |   

My cousin decided to marry her boyfriend of 2 years (they were both 21 at the time.) I became good friends with him and continue to be today. He was deployed overseas after being married for almost a year (Army.) Fast-forward nearly another year. He returns from overseas to discover she wants a divorce and on top of that had been cheating on him while he was deployed. They get divorced and she moves in with her parents. A mere few months later she is pregnant by the guy she cheated with. He immediately ditches her and the baby, leaving her to raise it alone.

My cousin and I are very different despite being close as kids. We didn't hang out much but I harbored no ill will until she cheated on her spouse who is a close friend to me. I was upset but I gave her the benefit of the doubt. ""People make mistakes"" I thought.

Fast-forward 18 months. Cousin gives birth to the baby and is living with my grandparents. They are getting on in years and they noticed their memories are not what they used to be (History of Alzheimer's in the family.) They decide to talk to their lawyer to check their affairs are in order because they are unsure how many years of being sound of mind they have left (Keep in mind right now they are still fine.)

Cousin takes grandparents to lawyer’s office. Cousin gets in her head (don't ask because I don't have an answer) that they are going to sign over to her sole power of attorney and management of their finances in preparation of them being unable to make such decisions in the future. The lawyer immediately shoots it down stating the following:

""That is premature as well as a poor choice of guardianship as the grandparents have two perfectly capable sons in their early 50's.""

Giving a 20-something single mom with no job and hardly any work experience that responsibility and power is a bad move.

She gets up on his desk screaming at him he has no right,etc. Lawyer asks her to cease at once or he will call the police. She doesn't. He gets on the phone to dial 911. She explodes out of the room and speeds off, leaving my grandparents stranded. The lawyer apologizes and pays for my grandparents to get a ride home.

Cousin is also best friends with my wife. They would hang out all the time and my wife really enjoys spending time with her little one. For me though, it was the last straw. My grandparents are the sweetest old folks you'd ever meet and she tried to take advantage of them before making a scene like that. I explained to my wife that I understand they are friends but I FORBID cousin to step foot in MY house. 

Since that day I have had no interest in seeing cousin. Wife still sees her now and again but less than before because she knows I've disowned cousin. I understand cousin is still family and was hopefully doing what she did for her child in the end but I don't think that is enough for me to stomach associating with her after that last incident.

1,"AITA for uninviting my girlfriend from a family vacation? | Some background:

My girlfriend and I have been going steady for about 2 years now. In that time, our relationship has become long distance because of my decision to work in a city multiple hours away, requiring half a day of driving to get there. As a result, we see eachother maybe once every two weeks to once a month at most. The nature of my work also means that I rarely get take any vacation time, and sometimes when my girlfriend visits I have to work for some of the time she is there.

Normally, this is no issue; we found a way to make it work. This particular time, some cousins of mine with whom I've been close with are here visiting my homecountry for the second time in their lives (10 years since the last time). 

Main story:

This past weekend, my girlfriend has been with us the whole time and coming out with us, so it was no issue. Now, weeks before they came, I planned to take them around my country to visit other cities multiple hours away. I asked my girlfriend to come along and be with us during these travels, but this morning I was asked by my cousins not to bring my girlfriend along because she ""changes the dynamic of the group."" I strongly disagree with this and want her with us, but it is my cousin's vacation so I asked my girlfriend if she would be ok with not coming. Obviously, she is devastated because we rarely get to see eachother and she was really looking forward to the vacation, but now she has lost the opportunity to come with us. She booked time off work for this, though it can be easily reversed and most of the investment has been emotional. 

I'm torn because I want to have her there and I rarely get to see her as it is, but I feel like I owe it to my cousins who are visiting to give them what they want. I also understand their point of view because when I visit them, they put their social life aside for me, though their relationships aren't long distance like mine. They hold no ill will to my girlfriend, but want us to be alone. Before they told me they want to spend time alone, I promised my girlfriend that everyone would get along, that we would all have a good time together and actively encouraged her to come. 

My girlfriend is hurt and upset at them, and is asking for me to somehow make up for the time lost between us before the end of summer by going on a separate other mini-vacation later on. This is really demanding for me as my girlfriend and I went on a 2 week vacation together earlier this summer and now with my cousins I am taking even more time off. A second vacation is going to be costly both financially and to my work. I am asking her to ""let it go"" this time, and to see the other perspective even if it is unfair to her, but she is incredibly upset about the time lost together because she was looking forward to coming and because now she won't  get to see me for another few weeks.

1,"AITA for telling my coworker to stop wearing a high school branded jacket to work? | My coworker John (65m) and I (23m) both work together as contractors in the construction industry. We buy most our work clothes from Opshop's because they get destroyed and unwearable within a couple of months. Anywho, on Monday, he rocks up to work wearing a new (opshop new) windbreaker jacket which I recognized straight away because it was my old high school jacket plus the fact that it has our high school emblem plastered on the front. 

I said ""are you seriously going to wear a high school jacket to work? Take it off, man. I've got another jacket for you.""

John is old but quite timid and I guess he took my tone as snarky (to be fair it kinda was) and didnt say anything back and just ignored me for the rest of the day. Today things were back to normal and he wore the jacket again but I didnt say anything about and we carried on as per usual. 

Now I wanna know if I was the asshole for even mentioning it the other day ? I personally think it's fucking weird to see a guy in his 60's wearing something that is part of the uniform for a high school but that could be my own problem since I only left that school 5 years ago and if I seen someone 40 years older than me wearing our uniform while I was still attending as a student, I'd be creeped out.",False,False

It turned out to have arrived in the original packaging, not an unmarked box as I was hoping. The gift was a fairly decent pressure washer. I bought it for my father seeing as how he kept borrowing pressure washers from friends to use around the house and I figured he’d enjoy having one of his own. 

Now I’m being labeled as an asshole by family members because for the past few years it appears that I’ve only gotten him “house gifts” or gifts that are used around the house (smart speaker, WiFi enabled thermostat, shop vacuum, mechanic creeper, etc). I bought these for their functionality, the fact that he will use them fairly often, and they all seemed like nice gestures.

She doesn't really try to hide it, a lot of people at school know about it. At one point, one of my class mates (we're friendly but not really friends) started asking me about my sister's learning disabilities. I told them I didn't know much about it, but then they asked if my sister was on meds, and without even thinking about it I just said yes, because she is, she takes them every morning, and you can totally tell on days when she forgets. Well, apparently that class mate went up to my sister and wanted to buy some of the meds...I didn't even think about the possibility of them wanting to buy meds. My sister is really pissed that I said anything.

0,"AITA for blowing up at my dad? | This happened like ten minutes ago. 

I do my homework (I'm in IB, so I have a shit ton of summer homework and other stuff to do) while I listen to music. And I listen to music through YouTube. So whenever I'm clicking through my work tabs to get to YouTube to choose my music, it just looks like I'm watching YouTube videos and not getting my work done, which isn't the case. Everytime my parents happen to catch me finding another music video to listen to, they make some snarky comment about how I never do my homework and only dick around, then lecture me for hours about how I'm gonna end up homeless if I continue this (this is gonna sound like a humble brag, but I""m putting this in just for context, but I have a 4.4 GPA and do a multitude of other extracurriculars that aren't easy to keep up with).

&#x200B;

The snarky comments wouldn't be bad, if they only did it once or twice, but they say it EVERY time they see me on the computer, regardless of whether or not they've looked at my screen, and they bring up how I'm always on YouTube whenever I'm not using the computer, too. I can't even smile at my screen without my dad saying, ""OH, so I guess your homework is REALLY FUNNY, right?"" alluding to the idea that I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing. That launches my mom into a tirade about how I'm lazy and never do anything I'm supposed to. When I try to tell him what I'm actually doing, he smirks and says, ""Sure."" like a middle schooler, and of course, my mom chooses to believe the worst. They won't stop. I've asked them to. They won't.

It's gotten to the point where I purposely sit with my computer facing away from my parents so they won't be tempted to start something with me. This time, I happened to be clicking on a music video and my dad walked up behind me and said, ""I guess you're really busy, huh?"" and my mom was nearby and I just knew that she was going to start with the disappointed ""tsks"" and ""All we've sacrificed for you, and you still waste your time on stupid shit like playing computer games."" So I just snapped. You know that feeling where you're so angry and frustrated that you just cry even though you don't want to? I did just that, and starting yelling for my dad to look at my screen and show him that I'm actually doing homework. He just backed off and said something like, ""Lol it's just a joke.""

My mom saw this and started screaming at me, saying that if the only reason I do my homework and go to school is just for show for my parents, then I should just drop out and become a homeless person like I was destined to be.

But today... my wife, my son and myself are swimming at the town pool, and a mother is breastfeeding in the water.  She is sitting in the shallower end, with the baby half floating and feeding.  It just seems inappropriate to me.  Nobody is allowed to eat in the pool.  No food or drink is allowed in the water.  And now you have a food/drink/bodily fluid contamination.

0,"AITA for asking my husband and stepson to stay out the house on weekends because they make so much noise playing fifa, and I’ve just given birth? | I have recently given birth (he’s just over a month old! Yay!) and as it was my first pregnancy I’m finding life incredibly tough and stressful right now. Breastfeeding isn’t going well, sleep schedules are completely fucked, my body is a seeping sack of sutures and stitches, and I’m honestly feeling like a broken person at the moment. 

Mentally I’m doing great, however it’s the physical part that I’m struggling immensely with.

My husband and my 13 year old stepson have a weekend tradition of ordering pizza, blasting UK garage which is... loud and bright to say the least, and playing fifa with the volume turned way up. 

I gave my hub the go ahead to carry on these weekend traditions because time with his son is important, and I thought it would be fine. Sadly however, the reality is that the noise levels are beyond ridiculous, they’re still the same as they were pre baby and I’ve explained to them both that even if baby is awake, sometimes I’m trying to get a 10 min power nap and the dulcet sounds of fifa commentators aren’t really doing it for me.

My husband turns it down, but then my stepson turns it way back up because he forgets. I’m also incredibly ratty at the moment and emotional, so my temper is flaring. I asked my husband to supervise that the volume is on low, he’s a gem who has been incredibly brilliant and over and beyond supportive so I don’t want to take away his only bonding time with his son, but the reality is I need sleep, and I need to heal.

I suggested that the two boys go to play fifa at my MIL’s who is literally a 5 min drive away from us, and my husband apologised and understood. My MIL however rung me up and told me that it’s also my husbands and my stepsons home and that it’s unfair that I’m kicking them out.

0,"AITA for refusing to spend Easter with my parents, because my mother keeps feeding my dog human food despite me clearly forbidding it? | About a year ago me and my SO adopted a stray dog. She's still quite fearful, but getting better every day. Because she used to be a stray, her teeth, digestive system and coat were in a poor shape. We managed to make it better through hard work and a light diet. Our vet told us that as a stray she probably ate a lot of trash and scraps of salty human meals, so we should be even more careful with feeding her processed human foods than usual. If we want to treat her, we boil some (safe) vegetables, give her a few slices of an apple or a spoonful of sugar-free yoghurt, but spicy and salty processed sausages or ham are off limits. So are heavy cheeses, sugary puddings and other sweets, fast food and so on.

As a part of her socialization process, we visit my parents quite often. It's great and I've always been grateful for them inviting us. However, last time we visited, my mother was in quite a mood for the entire time and actively tried to annoy me multiple times. Most of them I'd endure without batting an eye, but one thing that led to an actual fight was the fact, that she fed my dog human food, mostly pizza crust with spices and sprinkles of cheese on it **while looking me dead in the eye** **right after actually** **asking me if she can feed the dog and me saying no**.

Since at this point I already told her multiple times that this is not acceptable, I asked her why is she even asking me if she can feed the dog if she's gonna do it anyway. She answered ""because I don't agree with you"". It was a very stupid answer, so I asked does that mean she doesn't want us coming the her house, because it kind of looks like she wants to scare us out. She then said that she ""won't be blackmailed"" by me and she will ""do whatever she wants and if we don't want to visit, we don't have to"", so I answered that since I am not looking forward to watching the dog's every move and I think she poses a threat to her health, we won't be visiting for Easter or any time soon for that matter, to which she just barked ""fine"" like a moody teenager and me and my SO left.

I do not intend to set foot in that house until I hear a clear apology and she swears that she won't feed the dog shit again. Now I'm finding out that she's deeply offended, because I supposedly set restrictions on her *and her alone* out of spite and ""if I think I will win this peeing contest I am dead wrong"". On top of it I know this whole situation ruined Easter for my SO, because we refused to visit his mother to make plans with my parents. My dad is also sad, because we're not coming.

1,"AITA for reaching out to my ex-boyfriend’s daughter to offer condolences? | My ex and I were together for two years, and we broke up three years ago. He has a daughter who had just turned 14 when we broke up. So I was a “mentor” figure to this girl from the ages of 12-14, then hadn’t had any further contact with her, and she’s now 17.

My ex and I did not end on good terms and we don’t speak to one another. But I heard through the grapevine last week that his ex-wife, mother to his daughter, had died unexpectedly. 

I still have his daughter’s email address, and I sent her the following message. “Hi, sweetie. I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, but I wanted to reach out to you with my sympathies. If there’s anything that I can do for you, please don’t hesitate to let me know. We may not be as close now as we were when you were younger, but I will always be here for you if you want or need me.”

She did not reply. I got an email from my ex the next day that said, “You have no reason to be contacting my child. You are no longer a part of her life and your efforts to change this are unappreciated. She is grieving the loss of her mother and does not need additional drama from daddy’s ex-squeeze. I thank you not to contact my child again under any circumstances.”

I emailed my ex back and asked him, “Is this how \[daughter\] feels or how you feel?”

He replied, “It’s insane that you are even asking that. No matter her reaction it was completely inappropriate of you to contact her. Do not bother replying to this email message as you will be blocked.”

I have now already worked the shift that she gave me, but today she texted me saying that she can't work the shift she took from me anymore because she has ""a little, baby surgery."" She didn't offer anymore details on that.

Our company policy is that once you accept a shift, it is fully your responsibility. Regardless I tried to be helpful and ask everyone else who could possibly work that time if they could cover for her but they all said they couldn't.

The only reason I don't want to take the shift back is because I made plans to spend time with some friends at that time after I found out she would be taking the shift, and I cancel on them a lot for work purposes already and would hate to do that again.

0,"AITA for refusing to speak to my (white) best friends cousin in Hindi and telling him he needs to stick to English? | I’m a girl of Indian heritage who was born in the states, and very unusually, my parents were born in the USA also. We are about as American as it gets, and my mom and dad have very very little cultural ties back home to India. They are openly atheist, have white collar jobs and so their mannerisms, lifestyles, values, are all more american than Indian. 

Now they speak ‘conversational’ Hindi, just enough to get by, but me and my siblings basically only know how to count from 1-10 and maaaybe the names of a few animals. We’ve never learnt the language whether your opinion on that is good or bad, it just is what it is. We were only spoken to in English growing up. 

My best friend of 12+ years has a cousin who I saw on and off growing up. I’m seeing a lot more of him now because my best friends mom is getting remarried and it’s going to be a huge affair. So he’s been coming over whenever I’m with my best friend to help with things like moving stuff, picking up items, etc. 

Our families are really close so we are all in each others hair a lot. 

He has a really gross attitude towards me, he is obviously interested or attracted to me because he makes all these dumb jokes like how he ‘likes Asian spice’ or how ‘xvideos have a category for hot Indian girls like me’. He’s physically attractive and a gym rat so I guess he’s cocky enough to say dumb shit like that to me thinking it’s smooth but it’s cringe. 

His latest thing is trying to talk to me in Hindi. I don’t know whether what he’s saying is accurate or not (but it sounds vaguely ok to my ears, but I’m not fluent enough to really understand subtle differences) but I keep telling him I speak fucking English, so he needs to be talking to me in English. I don’t think it’s cute that he’s trying to speak Hindi to me, It’s not my language, it’s just a language I happen to know a few phrases of. 

I keep telling him it’s offensive and he needs to just calm down, he’s taking it all as a joke, saying he’s practicing his skills for when we get married (what the fuck?!) and everyone from my mom to my dad to my best friends mom to my best friend thinks it’s cute and he’s just trying to impress me.

0,"AITA for refusing to go to therapy after my fiance wanted me to go? She found out I saw someone die when I was 12 and thinks I am traumatized by it and need therapy. | Me and my fiance went over her brothers last week and her brother had a gun of guns. I told him I was uncomfortable around guns because I grew up in a neighborhood that had a lot of gun violence and I would prefer if they didn't shoot any of them near me. One of them asked 'why it was so bad', and I told them how bad my old neighborhood was. I also mentioned I saw a drive by shooting when I was 12 that hit a guy and killed him. My fiance sort of looked at me and said ""how come you never told me this?"" and I just said it never crossed my mind, and it was such a brief moment that I never thought it was a big deal. She was sour with me the entire night. At the end of the night, she asked me kind of angrily why I never told her that I saw someone get shot. I told her I never really thought it was a big deal and that it didn't affect me much because it was such a quick moment, and that I only found out he died the next day. She was quiet for a while, then asked again basically saying that its crazy I wouldn't think its a big deal to tell her something like that. She said that I could have PTSD and I need therapy and that she feels uncomfortable at the idea that I wouldn't tell her such a 'major part of my life' like that before we got married. Honestly, I just never thought about it that much. Some part of me thinks I shouldn't have even mentioned it at the table. 

&#x200B;

We've been arguing a bit on and off about this. She feels like she might have potentially married a traumatized person who was hiding their trauma, and that she feels like I have been dishonest with her on purpose, and she wants me to go to therapy. The thing is, she knew where I came from and how bad my neighborhood was. Seeing one guy get shot briefly was not the defining moment of the problems back then. I've also been to therapy for anxiety and she knows this, and I told her that I have mentioned my background, and she said I specifically need to see a trauma specialist. 

&#x200B;

I refused, almost on principle. Some part of me was kind of upset that I had this suburban wealthy girl telling me what is and what is not traumatizing about growing up in a high crime area. I know that sounds harsh, but the way she talks about it sometimes kinds of makes me think she views me as an inherently damaged person because of my upbringing and that nobody could possibly ever get past it.

Now of course I don’t mind if it’s like, his siblings to his mother in a conversation that shouldn’t involve me, but when they’re talking with my boyfriend as he’s sitting right next to me, I just feel weird.

I understand it’s their “normal language” as my boyfriend calls it, and I’m not trying to be all up in the business or try to have them change their ways, it just makes me feel left out and extremely confused and even a little awkward...

I’ve mentioned it to him and he gets defensive and angry, like they’re not going to change to make me more comfortable. 

I just feel that if the roles were reversed, I would have my family speak to me in a language my boyfriend would understand so he wouldn’t feel left out or like he’s missing something important.

Also I apologize about formatting I’m on mobile. 


Hi! I recently moved into a rent house in February. Prior to moving in I made an agreement with the landlord that I would clean the house, pressure wash, and take care of the yard for exchange of a discounted deposit and rent. The previous tenants of the home left without paying and left it a wreck. Anyways, the yard had been overgrown for the better part of a year, so very high grass and weeds. I don’t have a huge yard but it’s definitely pretty big, I’d say around 30x50 combined. My across the street neighbor was friendly at first, the guy had been laid off work for 5 years and wasn’t all there but we often chatted everyday when I got home from work. He was injured and let me know he gets paid about $4,000 monthly. He offered to cut my yard just like his, and his looked great for $60. I gladly paid him because after work, cleaning the house, and taking care of my daughter I was relatively busy. We had a pretty fair relationship, he would call me if he saw any body sketchy near my house, or pick up my garbage can out of the road, just neighbor stuff. Last week he asked when I wanted him to cut my grass again because it wasn’t bad whatsoever. I told him that, he doesn’t need to worry about it because it hasn’t overgrown. I came home from work that night and it was cut so I went over and knocked and thanked him and we spoke. He asked about these boat trailers I had in the driveway that belonged to my landlord and if she was willing to sell them. I spoke with my landlord yesterday, and gave him a call this morning just letting him know the information about the trailers, he then texted me asking me if I was planning to pay him for cutting my grass last week. I didn’t want to seem rude, so I agreed and asked if $20 was okay, my neighbor responded by saying he’s only going to charge me $50 for it. I let him know that was a bit expensive, and I’ll pay him this time but in the future I’ll cut it myself. I make okay money and I’m a single father, I can afford it but I don’t really have the expendable income to spend on yard work I can do myself. AITA for not wanting to pay him?",False,False

And sometimes she’s in there for 20ish minutes at a time several times a day. 

I noticed when she goes to the bathroom she always grabs her phone and takes it with her. So I told her at lunch one day it’s not cool for her to just fuck around in the bathroom on her phone during meetings and that she needs to do as much work as the rest of the team. She told me it’s none of my business and she still gets all her work done. 

That just pissed me off so I told her that she doesn’t get to do whatever she wants just because she’s the only woman on the team. She got very quiet for a moment and then once again told me it was none of my business. She then said that her going to the bathroom so much is a disability accommodation and if I didn’t drop it she would file a complaint with HR. But she’s in her mid 20s and she works out a lot and is very obviously not disabled so I told her so.

Hallway has candy wrappers on the floor and it’s dusty enough to cause me to sneeze. 

Angered, I called my stepmom upstairs to see the state that her son has left the bathroom. I told her since I won’t be here as much anymore that her son is going to have to pick up part of his slack (the only chores that he does is clean his room and take the garbage out)  and that he needs to clean the bathroom because I am not picking up after him. The mess wasn’t mine after all so she was understanding last night about it and told me she was going to have a talk with him. So I let it go, didn’t use the bathroom because it was nasty and went straight to sleep.

It was until this morning, that I received a message from her, in a group chat with me her and her son, to “address the situation” by leaving a long text of how we are both responsible for cleaning the bathroom and that I as the adult, he must follow along my steps blah blah blah. Point was, she was shifting the blame of how disgusting the bathroom was, on both of us. 

I didn’t leave the bathroom in that state when I left home 2 weeks ago so I feel like I shouldn’t be responsible for cleaning it. He doesn’t do much of the house chores, and barely cleans himself. He does the bare minimum in school too since he’s always skipping classes. He doesn’t have much responsibility and there for I feel like he should be the one cleaning his mess.

It upsets me that she wants to blame me as well, acting like I make as much as a mess like him, which I don’t because I never raised that way. 

My stepbrother doesn’t respect his mom and makes her do most of his chores (even after witnessing that mess, instead of making him clean it, she’s decided to do it herself). He will never take her seriously because she doesn’t punish him by grounding him and taking away privileges, he doesn’t know the consequences of his actions. 

I’m considering telling her off, because she always complains to me how she’s worried for his future and how much of a slob he is. But I feel like she’s hugely to blame because he wouldn’t be like this if it weren’t for her irresponsibility.

So am I the asshole if I tell her about this?",False,False

She was underweight t some point but not really now. I guess lately she's been ok because my parents don't really talk about it and I know she doesn't see a nutritionist anymore but just a therapist a couple times a month. I still kinda worry though but I didn't see much of my sister when she was at her worst (I recently moved back home after being away) so IDK if I'm wrong here.

Basically today she was making lunch and I came upstairs in the kitchen. Our parents were not home.  'If you want the kitchen, I'll be out in a couple minutes.' I said okay and just stood there watching her make her food. She didn't notice at first but when she did she said 'Uh could you not?' I said 'I just want to make sure you're okay, eating and everything."" She looked at me really weird and said 'I'm fine, it's none of your business and you're making me uncomfortable.' I said that wasn't my intention I just was checking on her. I really didn't mean anything except making sure she's eating. She said I was the last person she'd confide into about her problems anyways. Ouch. We don't have a great relationship but I want her to like eat and be okay and stuff.

She finished making food and stomped off. Later my mom told me my sister had talked to her and my mom explained to me my sister was actually doing good but I was making her feel like a child 'making sure she eats' and my parents trust her to eat, and it's been a while since things have been really bad.

Earlier today I received a wordy email from the school that boiled down to ""We are not prohibiting peanut butter, but we are discouraging it because of nut allergies.""

I get it. And I certainly dont want any other kids in the school to get sick or have a serious reaction. But, PB&J is the one sandwich my kids will consistently eat. I try to pack them something different each day and only do peanut butter once a week. It's really the only lunch my younger daughter enjoys, she kind of just tolerates other stuff. PB&J has the highest success rate of actually being eaten during their lunch break. They bring home a lot of lunches that just have couple bites eaten ...

When my older daughter started, she told me about a friend that had to sit at the ""nut-free"" or ""allergy"" table away from her. I was actually a little concerned; I didn't want my daughter's lunch to affect someone else. After talking with her about it, it sounded like the teachers actually did a good job explaining nut allergies and safe practices. The email today specified they are reinforcing hand washing before and after eating. 

I will be chatting about this with my youngest tomorrow and reinforcing it in the coming weeks, but I want her to enjoy her lunches too.

0,"WIBTA for no longer writing my work schedule on the family calendar? | TL;DR After I (19M) got a new job in the evenings, I started to write my work schedule on the family calendar to ease my mom's worry, but it turned into my nosy brother using it to essentially keep tabs on me. I want to regain the independence that I gave up by writing down my schedule. WIBTA for refusing to write my schedule on the calendar? My doing it is completely voluntary, and I started it for my mom's sake in the beginning. 

**Long version**

So I (19M) live at home while I'm going to college and working. I just started a new job about a month that is part time evenings, so my hours are slightly different every shift and it's not every night either.

At first, I would just leave without giving any notice that I was leaving because I don't feel the need to announce to everyone that I'm leaving for work. Other members of the family do the same, and I just think what I would assume that they do when I leave: if I want to contact them, we all have phone 24/7.

My mom didn't like not knowing and would get worried when she saw my car gone and couldn't find me in the house until she realized that I left for my job. So I joked saying ""do you want me to write my weekly schedule on the calendar"". This wasn't a joke to her, and she said ""yes"". So I did that, and it was fine that people knew where I was and I didn't care *that* much.

But then a couple days into this new thing, I got home from work a little later. My brother asked me where I was during that half hour, and if I went somewhere after work. So I explained that I helped clean up. Similar scenarios to this happened a couple more times, and I asked half jokingly if he always checked when I'd leave and when I'd be home. He said yes.

My brother is the type that always needs to know **everything** even if doesn't concern him. He always eavesdrops on our parents convos and it's pisses me off. Cut to new years day, a co-worker was sick and asked if I could fill in for her. I said yes knowing that holidays pay more. I wrote it on the calendar when I knew, and left about an hour later. This time I let my brother know. He was confused because he thought that I wasn't supposed to work that holiday, and he did not at all trust me. I jokingly asked if he wanted to see the receipts meaning the texts, and he said yes. So I showed him, but he was still distrusting.

This last instance was really what did it for me. By me writing my work schedule on the family calendar, I lose part of my independence because they know more about my schedule, and more importantly, I give my brother more power over me. By writing my schedule on the calendar, if I want to do something and use the guise of work as an excuse, I can't. So like I need to prep for stuff like that.

Would I be the asshole if I told my family that I would stop writing my work schedule on the family calendar in an attempt to regain some of my independence?

PS sorry that I ranted about my asshole brother lol",False,False

I (politely) said “Hey, do you have somebody who could jump on another register?” It worked! From then on, every time there’s a decent line forming, I ask the cashiers to call for somebody to get on another register.

0,"AITA for not cleaning up after my brother? | So I (18f) and my twin brother live in an apartment near our college a few hours away from home. My brother leaves the daily chores such as cooking and cleaning up to me and that was fine. I grew up helping my mom around the house so nothing really changed. We recently had our sem break and I decided to come home while my brother said he'd stay. When I came back a week later the apartment was absolutely disgusting. Cup noodles left on the table and floors, piles of dishes unwashed, clothes everywhere. Naturally the food attracted cockroaches. In the time we had been in the apartment there had never been cockroaches since I've always been afraid of them, especially those that fly. I immediately barged in my brother's room and woke him up. I got upset that he'd let the apartment go this bad. We had quite the heated argument where I basically told him how lazy he was and he implied that I was the maid so I was suppose to be the one to clean up. After the fight he left the apartment and I did clean up his mess because the apartment was so disgusting I couldn't stand it. Now it's been a few days later and I refused to do the cleaning and cooking for him. I washed my dishes but ignored his, washed and ironed my clothes but not his, didn't cook for him anymore and I've been ignoring anything he says that isn't an apology but he refuses to apologize saying he wasn't in the wrong. And now he apparently told our mom what I've been doing and she's mad at me. When I tried to explain to her what happened she told me that boys will be boys and that it's my job as the girl to mind the house.  Now the whole family (mom, dad, and two aunts from my mom's side plus brother) is mad at me. Now I'm confused, I thought I was right for being upset at him but now I don't think so since everyone is mad at me. Now it's them that's ignoring me, they say I'm being childish. Are they right?

1,"AITA For Not Letting My Girlfriend In My House When She Smelled Like Weed? | So my girlfriend of 7 months (24f), smokes a lot of weed. I don’t have any issue with her getting high, but I hate the smell of it. I can’t stand the smell of weed. We have talked about this before, and I asked her if she could get a dab pen, because dab pens don’t smell. She told me that dab pens gave her a different high than her smoking, and she didn’t like dab pens because of that. But she promised me she would try to keep the smell down to a minimum. Usually when we are together and she smells like weed, I grin and bear it. If I had to put a number on it I would say she smells like weed 25 percent of the time we hang out. Three days ago, she texted me and asked if she could come to my house, and I said yes. When I walked over to her car to greet her, and she got out, she stunk of weed. Like this is the strongest she’s ever smelt of weed, it was crazy. I told her that she couldn’t come in my house because she smelled like weed. She told me it was fine, and could just take a shower in my bathroom. I said no, and told her to go home. She again  told me it wasn’t a big deal and she could just shower in my bathroom. I got angry that she wasn’t just going home, so I started yelling at her and called her a stupid bitch and told her to go home. She finally understood, as she told me okay and went home.

 That’s when she came out of the bathroom and started to yell at me saying “GET OFF” and “GIVE ME MY FUCKING PHONE” and tackled me down. She then started to rant to me about how it was her phone and her property and I had no right to take it.

0,"AITA for not wanting to fix my relationship with my stepfather? | I never knew my father. My mom met my stepdad when I was 6, and they had my (half) brother when I was 7. He was pretty much the only father figure in my life, and gladly called me his daughter. We were never really close but the love was there.

My mom left for the first time 4 years ago. At that time I was working for my stepdad so we spent a lot of time together. He needed a shoulder to cry on. I listened to him saying horrible things about my mother and sharing intimate details. I tried to defend her when he was going too far but I mainly just listened. It put me in a very delicate situation, but I was the only person he could talk to. He also wanted to adopt me, but we didn't go through with it. A few months later the situation calmed down and my mom moved back in.

2 years ago my mom left for good. My stepdad called me many times, again insulting my mom and sharing way too many details. Once again I tried to make him see her side while providing emotional support. Then we progressively lost touch. In the meantime my mom wrote to me regularly on messenger telling me how my stepfather was harassing her, insulting her and so on. I repeatedly told her to either go to the police or tell her lawyer about it. It didn't mean I didn't love my stepdad, but he messed up and I was hoping that a reminder of the law would set him straight. 

In January my mom realised he'd had access to her Facebook for a year and a half. I felt terrible. I realised the reason he avoided me was because he'd read the PMs about him. I understood he'd be upset, but hoped he'd understand that I was thrown in the middle of a messy divorce and just tried to support both my parents when they needed it.

Over the course of the year his relationship with my mother got better. Then this summer I had to get some stuff from the family house but I had a really bad gut feeling and couldn't bring myself to ask my stepdad if I could come over. My mom texted him for me. He answered by calling me a hypocrite and a b\*tch, and said he didn't want anything to do with me. He cut me completely out of his life.

My family wants us to make up. But I can't do that knowing he chose to keep his little power trip going instead of confronting me when he first read the PMs. I believe this situation could've been avoided if he had told me he read everything and if we had talked about how I truly cared for him but he went too far. Now it's too late. He chose access to my mom's PMs over me. 

Now, it was my 21st birthday a couple days ago. Unsurprisingly, no message from him. Yesterday my mom tells me she confronted him again about abandoning me and he said laughing that he didn't and that I just had to contact him. I feel like an AH for refusing to do so.

Then, she got home, and her dad called me up and yelled at me, asking how dare I mutilate his daughter.

Still, he’s saying that since he’s the full time parent, he gets to make that decision, and is claiming that he’s making our daughter take the earrings out, which I also find ridiculous because, dude, they’re already in her ears.

0,"AITA or WIBTA if I went to see my dad for his birthday separately and skipped the joint birthday party that my family is having for him and my sister? | First time poster, long time lurker. Maybe the title already sounds like I'm TA, but please hear me out.

I (30F) have an older sister (40F). She has been emotionally abusive towards me my whole life. Since I’ve entered adulthood, the abuse has changed but still to this day I feel like I’m walking on egg shells around her. Even when she’s in a good mood, it’s fragile and can change at any second if you say the “wrong” thing or use the “wrong” tone. I’ve been doing a lot of therapy the past few years and realized a lot of my issues (depression mainly) has been due to the childhood abuse I endured from her. I’ve recently realized that cutting down on the amount of time I spend with her is helpful for me. This is usually easy because I live in a different city than her. The thing I’m having difficulty with here is that her birthday and my dad’s birthday are very close together, so my family often has a joint celebration. Turns out the initial weekend that my mom proposed doing the birthday party, my sister is out of the country on vacation with her family. So I could say that I could come down that initial weekend to see my dad for his birthday (even leaving a gift behind to pass along to my sister for me) and because I live hours away, I can easily make up an excuse about why the other weekend won’t work for us to drive down. ETA: I live in another city with my husband. 

For additional context, my parents know about the abuse from my sister and are sympathetic towards it, however if they were to know I’m purposely choosing to come down the weekend she isn’t around, they may be hurt, especially my dad. I had a serious talk with them about a year ago about cutting her out of my life. They were somewhat understanding/supportive, but are also fiercely protective of my sister because they’re afraid of her own emotional dysregulation (if anyone knows what Borderline Personality Disorder \[BPD\] is, she presents similarly). They essentially plead with me not to give up on her. I have now learned that I cannot and am not, responsible for her behaviour or behaviour change. This has been very freeing.

0,"AITA for not immediately telling my mother my social security number? | My mother called my today and with no context asked for my social security number.

I really didn’t mean this question any type of way, I was just curious because it sounded like a really good policy (for what little I know of insurance) and because of the new policy I am able to get an IUD not covered by the last one so I was excited to take advantage of that. She doesn’t know the last part and I didn’t mention it.  Plus, she didn’t need my SSN the last time she was shopping around for a new policy, so it struck me as odd that she suddenly needed it now. I do have my problems with my mother but I don’t think she’d do anything intentionally malicious. I was just curious about what my SSN was needed for and why. I did tell her what it was. She collected other information she needed to call for quotes. The entire phone conversation took less than 5 minutes. 

My dad immediately called me to rip into me about being a bitch to my mom and that “when she asks you a question you answer. You don’t ask her anything”.  He added that I either needed to make her day easier with instant answers or get my own policy immediately. He finished with I was ungrateful child who isn’t smart enough to know what’s good for her and they didn’t need me to be making their lives any harder by asking questions. 

I really didn’t think I was rude to my mother and maybe it’s none of my business why she’s switching policies again because they’re generous enough to allow me to remain on theirs, but my parents and I are usually very open with conversations like this.

It also saves us a lot of money on venue hire which is a complete blessing. Seriously much love to my fiancés parents for letting us do this. 

There is however one catch 

It is going to be quite a small ceremony with only close family present.

So with respect to her family for hosting us we're keeping the headcount low and inviting close family. (though I do get my best friend to be present as best man) but with the low headcount it leaves no place for other friends to be present. 

The after-party is open to all friends so they can be invited to that but the big day itself is unfortunately off the cards. 

So my question is would I be an asshole for not inviting some of my close friends to the big day? Or would they have to suck it up and accept being invited to the after-party?

Thanks guys",False,False
0,"AITA for not sharing many of my shirts with my roommate anymore because I don’t want her to stretch them out? | My roommate and I are good friends. We had a similar build so we shared clothes sometimes. I had no problem lending her my tops before. But I’m wary of lending her many of them now because she got a breast augmentation and I don’t want her to stretch them out and ruin the fit for me. It’s been over a month since her surgery. She was wearing loose sweaters during that time while I continued to borrow some of her clothes. 


Well yesterday was a nice warm day in LA and she asked me if she could borrow one of my favorite shirts to go out in town with with her boyfriend. I told her that she might stretch out that shirt since it’s a bit tight, so I suggested a few less form-fitting ones that she used to borrow. She said she could still fit in the shirt she wanted. She misunderstood what I meant by stretching out the shirt, so I clarified that I know she could still probably fit in the shirt, but I don’t want to take the chance that she permanently stretches out the fabric and ruin the fit for me. 


She said that was bullshit and I’m being paranoid. I apologized again for not letting her borrow that shirt, but I’m standing firmly on this matter. She told me she wouldn’t let me borrow any of her clothes anymore either if I’m being this stubborn. I said that was fine with me. She then snidely said that I probably just don’t want her pulling off my shirt better than I can myself. I told her that she was acting like a bitch. 


She apologized for what she said and asked me again if she could just try on the shirt she wanted to borrow or another one of my favorite form-fitting shirts and prove to me that it won’t be ruined. I told her those two shirts along with a few others are off limits, but again let her choose from a select few. She said she was alright and chose a shirt from her own wardrobe and headed out. I haven’t talked to her since. She came back late last night.",False,False
1,"AITA for getting a waitress fired after I overheard her talking badly about customers? | Throwaway just to be on the safe side. I’m a creature of habit and I frequent a few different restaurants regularly. At one of these places a few weeks ago, I was sat near the area where the waiters commune. I don’t have any sort of issue with them interacting and having fun and all, but this time I heard one of the servers, a young woman who I’ve been served by many times and has worked here for quite a while (more on that later) saying some not so nice things about one of her tables. She was apparently annoyed by them and made this clear by making fun of them with some choice words. I didn’t catch anyone else saying anything rude, but they did laugh. I was appalled, and I let the manager, who knows me well as I’m a regular, who said she’d deal with it promptly. 

I’ve been there a handful of times since and hadn’t seen her, so yesterday when I was there I casually asked my waiter about her and he informed me she’d been fired. My friend who was with me at the time, after hearing the story, told me I was an asshole that cost this girl her job. She said that having worked as a waitress herself, this is a common and harmless way of blowing off steam, that most servers do it but no one would dream of intentionally being rude to a customer directly. I disagree, these people are paying you essentially, it’s reprehensible to talk badly behind their backs and then turn around and play nice. Moreover, as I said this girl had worked there 2+ years, i doubt they would fire her over just this. There had to be something else.

1,"AITA for wanting my bridesmaid to get her hair and makeup styled? | So, I'm getting married in 2 months and I have spent the last couple of days narrowing down options for hair and makeup artists. I had mentioned to my 3 bridesmaids that I had found a really well known hair and makeup artist to do all of our hair and makeup for the day of at a good price. It works out to be $150/ per person for both hair and makeup, and I had done a lot of research to find that this is a decent cost. My friend turned around and told me that was ridiculous and that she will just do her own hair and makeup for the day of, which has frustrated me. The other 2 girls agree this is a decent price and are fine with it.
I feel like its important to note here....this is NOT her first time as a bridesmaid she has been in 4 other ones which required her to get her hair and makeup done. Money is also not an issue, as she has recently received an inheritance from her grandfather. She also isnt a fan of traditional weddings and doesnt see the point of a lot of the pomp and circumstance that goes along with it. If I was confident that she could match the general looks of the other 2 women, then I wouldnt care if she did it herself, but doesnt own any hair or makeup tools, and I would know as I see her weekly.I feel like this is her trying to throw her weight around and that because I've known her since we were tiny tots, she assumed I would let her do whatever she wanted.

1,"AITA for being mad my girlfriend moved into a house with four roommates, when we'd been talking about moving in together? | 

So everyone involved is:

Me - 28m 

Jenna - 24f - I've been in a relationship with her for three years

Ellen - 23f - Jenna's coworker

Meg , Bianca, Ramona- other roommates

My girlfriend Jenna and I were talking about moving in together, and she and I were disagreeing about budget, I wanted to rent a place in the $1700 per month price range, not including utilities. So if we split it halfway, we'd each pay 850 a month, plus utilities.

She wanted her rent and utilities to be under 700 a month, which honestly is extremely hard to find in our city unless you want to scrape the bottom of the barrel. She actually has a place that she pays that for now, and it's tiny, badly maintained, depressing tbh.

Then all of a sudden, Jenna told me that she'd signed a lease with her friend Ellen, who lives in a house shared by five girls. One of the girls was moving out, and they needed to fill a room. She jumped on it, she loved the place, and they'd charge 500 a month for rent. She gets along well with the other girls, she's visited Ellen often so she knows them all. 

I was really shocked she'd do that without talking about it, I'd thought we were trying to work out a way to take the next step and move in together. But she Just kept saying ""i told you that the places you like aren't in my budget."" 

I feel like it's a big problem for me, her budget is ridiculously low for how much she's making. Plus, I don't feel like I want to be around sorority-house style living, which is what this place seems like, they're always having people over, the place is honestly kind of trashy, we couldn't get a lot of privacy there with everyone in such close quarters. Hell, two of the rooms in the house that are being used as bedrooms aren't even supposed to be; one's a sitting room and ones an attic room.

The girls she's moving in with smoke a lot of weed too, which isn't something I want to be around.

I blew up at her and said it seemed like she wanted to go back to college days, not grow up. She got mad at me for saying that having roommates was childish, she was doing the most responsible thing she could by saving money young and there's nothing adult about spending outside your budget.

We had a huge fight over this.

I was doing my job and being polite, and at the end when it was time to pay the bill, the guy asked me for my number. I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed and just told him “no”. Honestly I couldn’t really think straight so I don’t know if that was too blunt, but his face kinda dropped and he said “why not?” And I just told him that I had to do my job. This guy was also a lot older than me and i really wasn't interested. I saw that he didn’t leave any tip after and even left a review of our restaurant saying that the staff was very rude to him. I gave him really good service and he was only acting this way because I didn’t want to give him my number. My co-workers are telling me that I should have just given him a fake number and avoided having him leave a negative review and not tip. AITA?

0,"WIBTA if I don't share inheritance money to my siblings? | My siblings both had terrible relationships with my dad. I didn't have the best, but I was with him in his deathbed. They weren't. My sister did regularly see him though.
 
My brother had a huge fight with my dad a couple years ago. My dad was dating a woman about half his age 50/28. My brother for some reason was not happy about it. Soon they brought in my brother's debt to the table. They never talked to eachother ever again.
 
My sister is a different story. She came out to our dad when she was 17. I wouldn't say he's a bigot, but he wasn't overly supportive. He just said ""Okay, I respect you"". I guess, that's not what my sister was expecting.
 
So we just recently had his funeral. He had his will done old fashioned in an envelope. I was really shocked. I got his farmstead and the house. My sister got $100,000. Which is still a huge amount. I got about 90% of his assets, and my sister got about 10%. 
 
I know stereotypically this kind of money breaks siblings apart, but I never actually felt that our bonds could be broken, till now. My sister and brother are demanding that I sell the farmstead and to give them a third of the profits. They even threatened legal action, which my lawyer says is BS. I have triplets, and I could really use  the extra financial support. My sister and brother are currently childless.

0,"AITA for coughing and sometimes showering close to midnight? | I live in a rather old apartment complex with understandably thin walls. Since the beginning of this year, I've been visited by an elderly lady from unit above me for 2 separate issues. One was around 7pm when I'm chopping up some food preparing dinner. She came down thinking I was doing some carpentry work at an unacceptable time. I don't think I'm chopping at an unreasonably loud level, it was only garlic and onion. On another visit, she came down saying there's a buzzing sound in the walls, lasting a 10-15 minutes, almost sounds like an electrical current humm. She was wondering if I was the culprit. I have no idea what she was talking about. 

Two weeks ago, I've caught a bug from a patient I've seen. Since then, I've been having this persisting dry post-viral cough which I'm expecting to last for about a week more. Additionally, I often work late emergency department shifts, finishing at 11pm. I'll come home, have a shower, then head to bed.

Today I came home with this note on my doorstep:

>Hi. please can you be aware that noise comes very easily from unit to unit. Coughing etc constantly and loudly, late at night and early morning, prevents fellow neighbours from sleeping. Try and muffle the noise, and shower, not near midnight if possible, as it will wake people up.

>We all have a responsibility to keep noise down. This is an old black with thin walls and it isn't easy but we can lessen noise.

1,"AITA for ordering pizzas to a party? | I went to a Christmas party at my cousin’s house. She holds this party every year. In year’s past, she’s had full meals out to eat. This year, she said she was just doing appetizers and desserts. I understood because her life has gotten hectic. And as host, she can choose what to provide.

However, the party was held during a meal time. The appetizers were a few anti pasta dishes and the desserts were some cookies. My family was still hungry and I heard other people complaining they were too. No one could leave early however, because we always do a Yankee/white elephant swap and some other activities. So, I ordered some cheese pizzas and had them delivered. It was enough to feed the party and they were happy.

My cousin got upset because it “upstaged” her. She said everyone was aware what she was providing and could eat before/after. To me, it was just making sure people had enough to eat. She said that wasn’t my responsibility. Her husband and surprisingly, my wife backed her up.

0,"AITA for refusing to share my champagne with my brother and being ""rude"" about it? | I'm still a little pissed off & don't know if I'm overreacting. This happened on the weekend, which was my 20th birthday (btw - drinking age is 18 in my country; Americans always get on me for this).

I love champagne, but only buy it when I have something to celebrate (i.e the end of final exams or a birthday) since it's so expensive (& I'm a broke student lol) & makes it feel more special. I also usually only drink about 1x a week as drinking much more often than that can make me not feel great. Anyways I bought champagne this weekend to have for my birthday. My parents & I sat down before dinner for 'happy hour' which is pretty much a weekend tradition in my house. I asked if they wanted any but they said to save it for myself & they had wine instead. Cool more for me. My parents aren't as big on champagne as I am anyways. 

My (30M) brother came out of his room after we'd been up there for \~30 minutes and asked what we were doing & could he have a drink. My parents said sure the wine is on the counter. He asked for the champagne. Here's the thing about my brother - on numerous occasions in the past, he's drank other people's alcohol on them. Drained the bottle. He barely pays for his own food or alcohol but always takes others. I find it so annoying & this is why I didn't want to share with him, but I would've been okay sharing with my parents. 

I told him no I bought it myself special for my birthday. He said it's not like it was a gift & asked if I was really going to drink a whole bottle of champagne tonight (tbf - it was NOT a full size bottle but a mini - there's 2 MAYBE 3 medium sized glasses in it). I said no but whatever was left I could drink tomorrow. He said it would go flat. I said my champagne stopper works pretty well. I reiterated that it was expensive & this was something I bought special for myself for my 20th. He said ""I bet you offered mom and dad some"" I admitted that I did but they said no & they're a different case anyways so I decided to keep it for myself. He claimed again it would go flat. I snapped and said ""I would rather drink flat champagne tomorrow than let you have any."" He accused me of being rude and went back to his room.

AITA for how I handled that? My brother just acts like he's entitled to everyone's EVERYTHING (food, alcohol, etc even if it's labeled) & I didn't want to share with him on my birthday. I guess I feel like what makes me TA is I would've shared with my parents if they really wanted champagne, but I definitely feel differently about them then my brother & I really get on with them.",False,False
1,"AITA for playing my guitar at a campfire of people I didn't know? | I am currently on a solo road trip across the country to just experience life. So far everyone I've met has been generally really cool and I've made some friends I plan on seeing again. 

I am currently at Grand Tetons and spent a lot of time out on the lake yesterday. When I got back it was pretty chilly so I saw some people about my age (early 20s) having a campfire. I got a sixer of my absolute gnarliest IPA and my guitar and walked over to say hello and hopefully make some friends. 

Everyone was cool at first and I handed out all six of my beers and got a Bud in return. I was cool with that since they were being cool. I just started lightly strumming my guitar as I was chatting with this really cool girl. She asked me if I knew ""3 little birds"" by Bob Marley so I started playing it. 

All of the sudden this dude just started making fun of me. I don't know exactly what he said but it was like ""we're all friends from Indiana University and this douche thinks he can play guitar over our conversation"" (again not exact but I know he mentioned IU  and called me a douche). The girl I was talking to said don't worry about him and asked me to keep playing so I kept playing. The guy got up and got literally in my face and said that if I didn't take my guitar and get the fuck out so he could talk with his girl friend he was going to shove it up my ass, then burn it then throw it in the lake. This time even the girl didn't stick up for me and I said that it was really lame to take my beer and not be cool. He said IPA is shit for hippies and burn outs from Oregon (good call for a dumb ass, he nailed that) and that it made me smell like shit. I got up and left and the entire group was laughing at me as I left, even the girl who asked me to play the song. I was camped a few spots over from them and I could hear them partying for a long time but they were gone before I woke up this morning. 

It was such and unnerving experience, was I the asshole there? I don't want to make that same mistake again.

0,"AITA for calling out my mom for babying my older brother? | I (21f) have an older brother (22) who never contributes to household duties.  The most he will do is unload the dishwasher when told to do so.  He sleeps all day and only comes down from his room for meals.  I feel that it's important to say that he has high-functioning asperger's but that only affects his social skills.

Anyways, I get yelled at by my mother if I sleep in, if I stay up too late, if I don't prove to her my homework is done, etc.  My brother doesn't get reprimanded for anything he does or doesn't do.  I have been fed up lately from having to live at home (I usually live in an apartment near my college), and this treatment hasn't made it any better.  

So, today I had enough of this and called my mom out for letting my brother be lazy all day and not getting any sort of reprimand.  I asked her if he knows how to cook anything other than pasta, she said no.  I asked if he knew how to make his bed, she said no.  I asked if he knew how to do laundry, she said yes but he can't fold his clothes.  I told her that she cannot expect me to do everything for him now, or later when he is living on his own.  She has mentioned in the past that it is my responsibility as his sister to always be there for him when her and my dad are gone, because he won't be able to care for himself.  Not to mention, she has told me that her and my dad will be buying him a condo for him to live in when he gets a job, while I'm told I get less than half of what he will get because I did extracurriculars in school that cost money.

After I said all of this, she said that I am wrong in saying that and that I ""don't understand"".  I understand that my brother is fully capable of doing everything I am expected to do, yet instead he is babied and isn't expected to do anything.  I also understand that I will be treated unfairly even after my parents die because they are giving my brother more in their wills, because he ""needs more"".

I assume that my mother thinks I'm an asshole for saying this, but I feel that I am justified for being basically punished my whole life for things that he is not expected to do.  And I know that him having asperger's plays a part in this, but it has never affected his physical capabilities.

0,"AITA for refusing to talk to my mom until she apologized? | Happened Dec. 2018, been thinking about the situation on-and-off since then.

I’m 23 (F) and my parents have me keep my phone’s location on at all times, even though I’m a graduate student and live away from home. 

I was with my boyfriend (23) for the day. My phone ended up at 5% before dinner, so I asked to charge it in his car. I knew that some cars can’t charge phones if the engine isn’t on, but bf said it’d work on his. I had also read online that putting your phone on airplane mode helps it to charge faster. It turned off my location, which I didn’t know about. I plugged my phone into the car charger, checked to see that it’s working, then went into the restaurant. I even used my bf’s phone to text my mom and let her know that my phone was charging in the car and that she could text my bf to contact me. I make it home by my curfew, and head to my room. A few minutes later, my mom immediately texts me, and the following conversation happens. I don’t remember the exact words, but here’s the general gist.

Mom: where were you?

Me: what do you mean?

Mom: your location was off. 

Me: I didn’t realize, I turned on airplane mode to charge my phone faster. 

Mom: you can’t charge your phone when the car isn’t on. 

Me: I thought that too, so I checked with [bf], it works on his car.

Mom: I’m going to try charging my iPad in the car without turning on the engine. 

Me: your car is a different model than his, it might not work.

Mom: it doesn’t work, I tried on all 3 cars

Me: like I said, his car is a different model

Mom: what car does he drive? 

Me: *gives make and model of car* why are you interrogating me?

Mom: maybe if you used some better excuse. 

At this point, I felt hurt. I said that there was no reason for her to be questioning me like this, especially after I had already explained to her what had happened. I said it was really hurtful that she would accuse me of lying or “making excuses” when I went out of my way to keep her updated. She ignored what I said and even went on to say “next time he’s here, I’m going to try charging my phone in his car when the engine is off, to show that you’re lying.” 

I was really upset my mom didn’t seem to trust me. I told her that until she was ready to apologize and treat me like an adult instead of a criminal, I didn’t want to talk to her. The next morning, when she tried talking to me, I ignored her. When my dad finally asked if we got into an argument, my mom said, “I don’t know what happened. She’s mental.” My frustration boiled over after hearing her dismiss my feelings in such a demeaning way. I ended up crying and tried to explain what had really happened to my dad. I barely got two sentences out when he cut me off and told me to apologize to my mom. When I refused, he said that I was ungrateful.

She was gorgeous, very smart and she knew ait. She told me that no boy would ever touch me, that I would be a virgin forever, and that an ''ugly freak'' like me wasn't meant to breed. 

I'm now married, have two lovely kids and a job I love. I had no idea what became of Rachel up until recently, last I heard she was our school's big star for having got into some super great university. 

Was on facebook and a post was shared by one of my friends of a woman grieving her miscarried baby. I normally share these posts but then I saw the name. I don't have her on facebook but we have a fair few mutuals. 

I felt bad for her but after everything she did to me I shed no tears. I took a screenshot and sent it to my best friend Emily, and wrote ''Maybe some people just aren't meant to breed''. She was there when Rachel made that comment and held me while I cried.

Emily texted back ''I know what you're talking about, but that was just heartless and cruel''. Bear in mind that she was bullied just as mercilessly as I was by Rachel and her friends. 

Of course Rachel doesn't deserve what happened, but she's still a disgusting human being who I don't have any sympathy for. She's in every nightmare I've ever had. I haven't seen her in 10 years but I still have nightmares about my husband leaving me for her even though I know it would never happen. That's how badly she destroyed my mental health. 

Emily is ignoring my texts and not answering her phone. I don't see why she's being like this.

0,"WIBTA if I refused to translate medical jargon for my family anymore? | I (25f) am a first gen college student, and am almost finished with my nursing degree. My family is all insanely supportive and proud of me, and generously have all come together to cover my expenses as far as rent/food/pocket money/car/insurance etc, so I can be completely focused on school. I’m so increasingly thankful for them all but they’re starting to get on my nerves.

Since I’m studying to be a nurse, I can understand and break down medical jargon to my family in a way that they can understand. I never minded, but now it’s starting to get too much because they’ll ask me for medical advice, based on me explaining their jargon. For example, today. My grandfather calls, and asks me to explain to him about Stem Cell Therapy to him. I explain, and then he goes on and asks, “So, should I get stem cells injected into my knees for my bone on bone arthritis?” I try to tell him that I’m not a medical professional, I can’t really prescribe or advise on medical decisions. He started to get upset and basically demanded that I tell him what I thought. I finally broke down and after reiterating four or five times that I’m not a medical professional and told him I wouldn’t advise it, because there’s no evidence that the injections would make his cartilage grow back, but he should mention it to a doctor for a more professional opinion. He decisively tells me that he won’t be doing it, then, because of what I’d said. This is essentially what my whole family does. 

**I am not a medical professional!** I don’t feel comfortable with my family asking me to ok or veto potential treatments or operations, but they don’t listen when I tell them that though!

Our neighbours both work in a hospital, she's a doctor and he's a nurse. So I asked them if they would like some food and they said yes. So the last few weeks I always froze heaps of food and gave it to them so that every day they could just quickly heat something up. They seemed to appreciate it.

Skip to last Wednesday. It was my daughter's 16th birthday and I wanted to make her favourite cake. At 1pm I started mixing all ingredients together. Only 5 minutes later I hear someone ringing our doorbell. I was our neighbour and she seemed quite upset. She said they only just got home and wanted some rest. I apologised and explained it was my daughter's birthday. She said it's selfish of me and that right now there are other things that are more important and her sleep is one of those things. 
I felt really bad and later brought them 2 slices of the cake as an apology.

But later when I talked to my husband about it he said that yes some things are different now but that doesn't mean that our daughter's birthday is not important too. I thought about it and agreed. I haven't brought them any more food since.

Every few weeks there'd be a cascade effect where someone would post a glowing tribute to them, quickly followed by a dozen more people and to be honest I found the whole thing kinda gross, as if it was a game of one upmanship other than respect.

So I reported the account, provided a link the the death via local newspaper website and waited a few days. Suddenly the page is now a memorial page and those friends are kicking off because someone desecrated this dead persons memory by reporting a dead person as dead.

We fight a fair bit and don't get along a lot but I don't hate her, and we both try to have each other's backs as much as possible. This whole issue started when she ""forgot"" to warn me that our parents were home when I thought she was looking after me so I skipped curfew (idk if she intentionally did it or not but I find it hard to believe she just forgot). Needless to say I was grounded and I was pretty pissed that she didn't text me that they came home early, and the fact that she made fun of me CONSTANTLY for that and it really pissed me off. I was out with friends so I wasn't home but apparently my sister come home high as a kite and my parents FLIPPED THEIR SHIT on her and grounded her for like 3 months. I wasn't home and had no idea what she was doing or unless I would have texted her. She has been pretty sad about this cause now she's gonna miss something for her dance team or something. I felt bad for her I really did but then I remembered how she teased me for being grounded and I did the exact same to her. After like a day of me doing this she told me to F off and how she's not in the mood. I told her I'm just getting her back to how she acted when I was grounded.  She went silent and just said under he breath ""its different cause your the weird anti social girl at school and I'm not.""  I was pretty hurt when she said that but I was kinda mad and if she just asked me to stop I would've.  

We usually have these playful teasing matches, most of them get pretty heated sometimes but its usually all in good fun.  I started to bring up her punishment during those and she usually goes cold after that.  It makes me kinda happy that I have one up on her cause she ALWAYS wins those little bouts but now I have something.  No one is really hurt by the teasing but it does kinda make her shut down a little na just gives up.  She has done the same to me.

1,"AITA for telling my vegetarian daughter it would be easier if she just ate meat? | I do feel kind of bad about this, but I was just frustrated. My daughter is 20 and been vegetarian for 2 years. Last night I was making dinner for the family and she was making her own separate meal. There was a lot going on and between the 2 of us, every burner on the stove was being used, as well as the oven itself, and the microwave. There were so many dishes and we have a tiny kitchen so we were getting a bit frustrated with each other being in each others way, admittedly particularly me. 

I got so frustrated and angry at one point and said 'Guess I'll be doing the dishes. There's SO many.' She said 'I can do them. Jesus, calm down. I only used 2 dishes anyways, most of them are yours.' I finally said out of frustrated of coordinating our cooking 'You know this would all be so much easier if you just ate meat with the rest of us!""

I immediately felt bad when I said it although I didn't apologize until later when we both calmed down. All she said to me was 'You know you guys could go vegetarian too, or even just eat a vegetarian dinner a couple times a week. Don't blame me.'

AITA? I didn't mean it, I was just frustrated, but she's still mad at me for saying that to her.",False,False
1,"AITA for telling my wife she needs to remember that she has a husband | My wife and I have been married for almost a decade. She is very caring and attentive and has always wanted to be a mother. We were unable to have biological children but recently adopted a baby boy. This has changed things.

Ever since the adoption, my wife has been entirely focused on my son. She rarely makes the time to talk to me beyond basic “how was work” type questions and telling me to change the baby’s diaper or hold him. She has stopped doing all the little things for me that made me feel loved.

I tried to sit her down and remind her that she has a husband too, and I have managed to balance time with the baby and being there for her. She got upset with me and told me that she’s still adjusting to motherhood. I told her this is something she could take into account. She said I was rushing her and being condescending. She then decided to accuse me of not stepping up and doing as much as she is. I got angry and I will admit that I yelled that she takes me for granted. She took my son to her mothers house and told me she needs time away from me. 

I know it escalated and blew up, but I feel she’s being unreasonable and irrational at the moment. Am I the asshole for reminding her that she is a wife and not just a mother?",False,False
1,"AITA for Wedding Conversation Gone Wrong? | Somehow my gf (23F) and I (28M) got to talking about marriage and wedding rings. We've been together almost three years. I mentioned how a co-worker's husband spent 6k on an engagement ring and I was like ""yeah, I want to go under that."" My gf looked up the average price of a ring and said it was about 6k and I believe my words were ""yeah, you're not getting that,"" which I admit probably stung but wasn't what I meant.

Then, to compound all this, we got to talking about weddings and I talked about how much money they are and how I didn't want to blow through all my savings just for one day. Then she said ""You know girls plan this stuff since they're, like, 8, right?"" and I said ""Yeah"" and then she went quiet.

She cried off and on all day yesterday and it completely ruined both of our days. At night she said some very scary things and it seemed way too overboard for what had happened.

Reddit, I just think the whole marriage culture is a money pit. I'm fine with a solid ring and a nice, decent wedding, but I did not at all expect this reaction from her. I would have been fine with a rational conversation, but I didn't get that. I'm probably an asshole for the way I phrased my overall message, but I'm asking more generically -- am I the asshole in this situation?",False,False
1,"AITA for lumping my flat-chested friend in with the guys as a joke? | I’m a senior guy in college. My two senior guy friends host house parties often and there are many regular attendees, mostly seniors and some freshmen. There’s this freshman girl Winnie. She comes because she’s best friends with one of the host’s little sister. She regularly makes fun of her own flat chest even when the topic of boobs only tangentially comes up. No one else does besides her best friend. Winnie has even said she would be president of the itty bitty titty committee. I assumed she was rather proud of her flat chest since she always brings it up. 


Last night, we played a game that pitted the guys versus the girls. As we grouped together by gender, I said “Winnie what are you doing over there? Team A cup is over here.” Most people, even some girls, started laughing. Winnie, her best friend, and a senior girl said that was incredibly mean of me. I said that I assumed she was proud of her flat chest since she always brings it up. Winnie’s best friend told me it’s a dick move for other people, especially guys, to bring it up. I said it’s just a joke. People started to argue about the dickishness or lack thereof of what I said. Most of the guys were on my side while all of the girls were on Winnie and her best friend’s side. 


The girls wanted an apology out of me but I assumed no fault. Winnie was mad at me and left with her best friend and another freshman girl. We couldn’t play the game because we needed an even number of guys and girls. The aforementioned senior girl said that anyone with a brain should have known that Winnie is insecure rather than proud of her boobs by the way and how often she talks about them. Some of the guys agreed with her but still maintained that it was just a harmless joke still. She wanted me to sincerely apologize to Winnie. I probably will and explain the misunderstanding, but I don’t think I did anything wrong.",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting to know my bio-dad and family? | I'm the result of a one night stand and my dad was never a presence in my life. My mom remarried and that man became my father. They had kids together and we were a big, blended family. Two years ago I got engaged. Around that time my bio-dad got back in contact. He apologized, explained why he was gone. I understood his reasons. He was a drunk, on drugs, living on couches then. He wasn't ready or in a position to be a father and I believe him when he said he was too far gone to get right for me. Leaving was the best thing he could have done because it opened the door for me to have a stable life. We'll call Bio-Dad: Mike.

I let Mike in on a low-contact basis. We'd meet for lunch or dinner once a month. I didn't want to meet his family, wife and daughters, which I guess makes them my half-sisters. I didn't tell him I was engaged but I forgot to take my ring off so he found out. Somehow he got the idea he'd walk me down the aisle. I told him my (step) dad would be doing it. Mike got upset and started offering ""alternatives"". Maybe he could walk me halfway, or both him and my stepdad could take an arm. Then he suggested I make everyone happy and have my grandpa walk me. I told him I was uncomfortable with his emotions and needed a break. I cut him off. For six months he stayed gone but then he started sending me letters about himself, photos of his life, his family and whatnot. 

One day about three months ago he brought his 13 and 16 year old daughters to my place of work to meet me. I asked them all to leave and went to my manager's office until they left. More recently he showed up at my house with the daughters, his wife, and his parents. I asked them to leave and told Mike that I wasn't interested in knowing him. I didn't want him or his family in my life. He insisted I should at least try to know ""my sisters"". I told him I wasn't interested. I had a family, siblings, grandparents, and his family was not part of it. I told him to fuck off. He asked me about my wedding. I scoffed and asked if he seriously still thought he was invited. He asked me about walking me down the aisle. He was crying. I told him I wished he had never contacted me and that he should just leave me alone. He left but he couldn't stop contacting me so I got a restraining order against him.

Some of my friends have been in the know and I've been honest with them. They told me I took it too far with the legal blocking and I should try empathy. He gave me up so I could have a better life but it didn't mean he didn't love me. Apparently because he made a hard choice he has a right to know me now that he's turned it around. I know he doesn't have a ""right"" to me but do I have some kind of moral and emotional obligation to honor his sacrifice of me by letting him in? My friends said it was a dick move for cutting him off and going off on him

Stupidly, I messaged my friend about my moral temptation and WHILE I was messaging him he was telling another guy at work about it. I was miffed when I found out but he kind of apologised and said he didn't know I wanted it kept quiet and thought it was relevant as everybody's pay was wrong that week and he was just trying to help. Whatever. Also in that same week I am hosting a relatively intimate group of family and friends at my house for my birthday.

I message my friend about it and he pretty much just says, ""yeah my bad, maybe don't tell me things in the future I don't know how to keep my mouth shut."" I pretty much told him that was a piece of shit attitude and that he should be embarrassed that he cant be trusted.

1,"WIBTA if I told my stay at home wife we should not need to hire house cleaners? | We live a comfortable life. I work full time in sales, my wife stays home with our 4 and 1 year old kids. We currently live is a 2 story house with a large yard/pool. When we first moved to this house we did not have kids and both worked. I did the yard/pool and she maintained the house, and I would help. We would randomly hire a landscaper or house cleaner depending on how busy we were but generally handled much of it on our own. We are about to move. We are upsizing our house but it will be a 1 level, however we are downsizing our yard and maintenance will be much less. When we first decided to list our current house due to me working, we hired a landscaper and pool guy to maintain both on a regular basis to make sure it looked good if a potential buyer wanted to see the house. For the most part we still maintained the house together. 

My wife asked that when we move since we will not need a landscaper/pool guy can we hire a cleaner to come monthly/biweekly. With all the changes we can certainly afford it, however I feel like we should not need to. I completely understand a stay at home mom with 2 kids under 5 is hard work. And I appreciate all she does for us and our kids to keep them active and healthy. However, I do feel like house cleaning is part of the job being a stay at home parent. I do cook 75% of the time, since I enjoy it and generally know how to cook a wider range of foods. With that I generally do dishes and keep the kitchen clean. She does do laundry 90%.  

I also believe hiring cleaners so often sets a bad precedence for the kids as they would think it is not necessary to keep things clean on their own.",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting to share the things I bought with my lazy autistic brother? | I'm 19 and my brother is 22. He has been slacking his ass off at home for the past few years while my parents have been working and I have been studying/working part time.

Now, normally when he's using something my parents bought, I have no control over it so I don't care if he's using it. But recently I bought a PC with my own money that I have saved up over the past few months from my part time job. I refuse to let him use it because I hate the fact that he is constantly relaxing at home and using our stuff while we are out here trying to make a living. Whenever he ask to use/play something I bought, I refuse and we both start an argument.

He then usually calls my parents like a little kid and complains that I don't allow him to touch my stuff. My parents then call me and ask if I can just share my stuff with him. I explain to them my reason for not wanting him to touch my stuff, which is what I said above.

I feel like my parents have spoiled him too much because they kept giving in to my brother's wants. Two years ago, my brother wanted my parents to subscribe to a football channel to watch the 2018 World Cup (he's a football fan) and promised to get a job when they buy it for him. They bought it for him and my brother did actually find a job, but quit after a month, and even admitted that he lied to my parents that he will get a job just so my parents will subscribe the channel for him. That was when I knew I shouldn't trust him, and I won't provide him freebies like my parents did.

1,"AITA for explaining I don't want my friend's money because I'm rich and she's poor? | A friend of mine, or rather a prior partner of a friend of mine, has an autistic daughter who is particular about the pillow she uses. My understand of the events leading up to this post is the daughter was sick over the pillow and this friend threw the pillow out, replacing it with a different pillow in the house. This doesn't fly with the daughter who sleeps on the floor rather than use the pillow which is different from her preferred pillow.

She asked for help on a Facebook post to see if anyone can pick up this specific memory foam pillow because she doesn't drive and doesn't want to bring her kid on a walk in the current weather and situation. I offered to help.

So I get the pillow, it's $44.99. I deliver it, and she hands me a $50. I know this friend is not in the best financial spots: being a single mother relying on benefits in the current global situation is a burden. I insist on not taking the money, I want to be altruistic for a friend, and she really does insist.

This is where I might've been the asshole. I told her I didn't want the money because I didn't need it. I told her she likely needs it more than me, at least a hundred fold. I run my own business and make decent money, this $50 is nothing to me to be blunt. I tell her as much and she relents but then posts a public post on Facebook explaining how she doesn't want pity from her ""friends"" (quotation emphasis hers) and she no longer replies to my messenger messages.

Was I the asshole? I wanted to do a good thing and probably came across abrasive, but this $50 might mean more to my friend: it could be eat-or-don't-eat, I don't know. All I know is she struggles financially and is vocal about it.",False,False

I just don’t understand why someone her age should be playing a game designed for kids. On a side note, her playing has ruined the game entirely for me because, trust me, when you engage in a raid battle with YOUR MOM of all people, you realize how much this game is NOT for middle-aged people. Now, from time to time, she complains about there not being any shiny Pokémon in the wild, which I take offense to because as an avid player of the original games, I know how hard it is to get a shiny Pokémon; however, Go players get all these stupid community events where everyone can get a shiny Pokémon, eliminating the challenge the original games had where you never really knew if a Pokémon you encountered was shiny until you knew.

0,"AITA for kicking my dad out of my house while he’s sick? | My dad was never around for most of my life. He left when i was 5 and came back 12 years later. He tried creating a close relationship with my siblings and i, but it never worked out. I’m now 24 and my dad’s (52) been living with me for the past 2 years. 

Due to him not being there for none of my siblings, none of them care enough to take care of him. He was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes last year and he’s been taking insulin at home. My fiancée and i had our first baby girl last year as well, we love her very much. This has made her a temporary SAHM. She lets our baby roam around the first level of our home in her baby walker while she does some chores. It’s never been a problem until last christmas.

We had some friends over for a christmas eve dinner and one of them noticed a syringe needle by the couch. I immediately took care of the problem and talked to my dad about it once the guests were gone. I told him to dispose of the needles in the right place after he uses them because it’s dangerous. He didn’t listen and kept doing it without my knowledge. It got to the point where my fiancée poked herself with one when she was cleaning the house 2 weeks ago. I tried talking to my dad about it one more time, but it’s like the more i do, the more he does it. My fiancées been making our daughter where shoes (which she hates) because of my dad. 

Last night, i tried talking to him one more time and he literally walked away from our conversation. I was done with his BS and basically kicked him out. I told him to take his medicine and things that were important with him while he figures out where he’s gonna live from now on. I paid for a motel room for him last night. I’ve been paying his phone bill and medical bills too, but i’m planning on canceling that soon. I’m guessing he told his family about what happened because i woke up to spams of voicemails and messages insulting me, but also trying to convince me to let him back in. I called one of the numbers back and it turned out to be my dad’s sister.

We talked for a bit and she asked if i would be able to buy a plane ticket for my dad so he could return back to them. I said i wouldn’t be able to do that and that’s when she started screaming and insulting me. I called her trailer trash and hung up. I ended up messaging her an hour later telling her that they have a month to get him before i cancel his phone bill and throw out his things. She sent voicemails of herself crying hysterically in return and apologizing, but i ignored it.

0,"AITA for not paying my friend the $400 I “owe” him? | Okay so immediately that title makes me look like a total fucking douche, but let me elaborate. 

My friend Charlie and I recently rekindled our friendship, among rekindling our entire high school friend group, after the group broke up and went no contact for roughly 8 months. The group consisted of about twenty people and went strong from Freshman year until just before Senior year, so about 3 years. 

Anyway, while conversing with everyone one on one and rebuilding connections with different people, it comes up that one of my closest friends from those days, Charlie, has been voicing that I owe him $400 fucking dollars in GAS MONEY from the days when he’d drive me and other friends in his car, like sophomore year, so ya know, 2 years ago. He literally wants money for actions that he never asked money for. Not one time in our friendship or in our endeavors did he ever mention wanting gas money or any type of payment. 

And it’s not like we were just using this dude for rides; for reference, Charlie and I used to have a system where every time we went out to eat, we’d take turns paying for each other’s meal. It was just a cool courtesy tradition thing, and neither of us thought much of it. Charlie was one of my best friends, but this is ridiculous. 

If I genuinely felt I owed him $400, I’d pay him no question. But I do not believe I owe him a fucking dime. He offered to be the one behind the wheel all those times, despite other friends of ours also having cars and licenses. Frankly, this sounds like a cash grab for absolutely no reason. 

And yes, he is completely dead serious and has voiced this directly to my face as well. He refuses to move forward until I pay him. He doesn’t want payment from the other friends he also drove around, literally just me.

0,"AITA for telling me flatmate his friend can’t stay with us after he brought someone back to our apartment | I’ll keep it short, I (29M) live in a three bedroom apartment with my flatmate Peter (32M). 

One of Peter’s friends, Shane (31M), recently stayed with us for a week or so after he moved out of his apartment before travelling overseas on an extended holiday. I wasn’t fussed by this at the time as it was only for a few days. 

Following the first time he stayed with us for a week or so, and before his extended holiday, Shane went on a short trip home for about two weeks but has now came back to our apartment for a few nights.

Tonight I got home from work and thought I had the place to myself as Peter works nights. After I had a shower I heard Peter in the living room playing music, and while I thought it was a little strange (it was around 10 pm and he usually wouldn’t do that on weeknights when I work the next day), I went to say hi when I noticed Shane drinking and making out with a woman I don’t know on our lounge. 

I left Shane in the living room, went to my room and sent Peter a few messages telling him we need to talk about a few things tomorrow. He obviously realised something was up and we exchanged a few messages about Shane in which I basically said I thought it was not cool a guest in our apartment (who wasn’t paying rent) had decided to bring someone back to our place. I told Peter that if Shane wanted to do that he should either get a hotel room or have gone back to her place, particularly given Peter wasn’t home with him. 

Peter than accused me of being an asshole and said Australian hospitality is lacking (I’m Aussie, Peter is Russian and Shane is Dutch). I said Shane was taking the piss and if he wasn’t paying rent he needed to leave tomorrow. 

I should add, when he first stayed with us Shane either slept on a mattress in the lounge room or Peter’s room. Since then my other housemate has moved out and Shane has been staying in the third bedroom this time, although we have a new flatmate moving in later this week so that would have had to change shortly.

Before going on the trip, my girlfriend told me that Haley, who is one of her friends going on the trip, is the girl that humiliated her once in the PE locker room and once during high school volleyball practice. She told me about the stories before but not the girl’s name. I asked her why Haley did those things to her and she said Haley was jealous of her looks, her popularity, and the fact that she always got it her way. 


My girlfriend said they aren’t the best of friends, but Haley has sincerely apologized for her actions and has told my girlfriend the reasons she humiliated her was out of jealousy, but that she has found self-love and wasn’t jealous of anyone anymore. My girlfriend also said Haley only seemed to take her jealous rage out at her and not anybody else. 


The other four people met up at my girlfriend’s house and we drove up to the ski resort. Haley seemed like a chill girl. On the ride there, I asked her about how she met my girlfriend and what it was like being volleyball teammates with her. She brought up the volleyball incidence herself, said she was deeply repentent about it, and asked me if my girlfriend ever told me about it. Right after I said yes, my girlfriend told us to stop talking about it. 


Haley once again apologized to my girlfriend for treating her like shit. My girlfriend told her she already forgave her years ago and begged Haley to stop beating herself up about it. I commended Haley for being so openly apologetic and asked her how she was able to get over her jealousy over my girlfriend. I think everybody was dumbfounded by what I said. Haley was obviously taken aback and just said “what?” 


My girlfriend shouted for everyone to just stop talking about this again. Haley asked me what I meant with my jealousy question. When I started talking, my girlfriend shouted again for everyone to shut up. Haley told my girlfriend to let me speak. I told Haley that if my girlfriend really doesn’t want me to talk about it anymore, then I won’t. It got super awkward between everyone. 


It got a little better once we reached our destination and weren’t trapped in the vehicle anymore. Haley and my girlfriend had a private conversation and seemed to have worked things out.

0,"AITA for enforcing the day off I asked for months ago? | Because I am apparently the only one in town with the ability to work between 2-4 (And we are also apparently the only place open during those hours judging by how many people come in... seriously if I get coronavirus I will bring the entire town down with me...) I haven't had a day off during the weekday since last decade. 

As a result, it's nearly impossible to schedule appointments for things like vision since they are never open during weekends, close when I am off, are booked solid during mornings (Which is why I have to book months in advance) and anywhere else that is isn't covered by insurance and/or is two hours away. 

I scheduled an appointment almost two months ago. Nearest appointment was 2:30 PM... march. I scheduled this in *January*. My bosses told me this was not a problem. 

...until the day came up and once again, I am the only one who can work between 2-4 and got called asking if I could come in. I told them they charge me to reschedule at such short notice. So they tell me they will find something.

0,"AITA for not getting my partner a Christmas gift after being told no gifts? | I'm copping flak for not buying a Christmas gift despite explicitly being told ""no buying Christmas gifts this year"". What I did do was borrow a friend's old fashioned pen (wood with metal tip) and ink bottle and try to write a letter with a bit of flair (I did traditional calligraphy back in school, but it's rusty now). I saw a letter as not disturbing the spirit of ""no gift"" agreement. 

On Christmas I gave the letter and what I received were gifts of substantial value (after currency conversion ≈ $180USD). There was much disappointment on her end as I didn't buy a gift and a letter was seen as a ""cop out"". I felt very awkward as I thought the agreement was no gifts. I tried to say return the gifts as we agreed

There's been some tensions about this and discussions that I should have understood that ""no gifts"" really means ""yes, gifts"". Some friends and family have told me that I have to learn when no means yes. I'm getting told a ""no"" is contextual by my significant other, however I find this stupid. My main argument back was that the definition of ""no"" has to be consistent otherwise the word loses its meaning.

However now there's this passive aggressive spat going one that I constantly seem to be the bad guy in. Anytime I ask ""do you want me to do X household thing? (iron her clothes, take out garbage when half-filled, etc.)"" I get told ""no"", then when I don't do it I cop flak because I should have taken it as a ""yes"".

I don't know. I don't really feel like the ""arsehole"" here, but family and friends' comments seem to indicate I am. I guess perception is reality and I might actually be the arsehole to them. But, I will still refuse to accept that ""no gifts"" can ever mean ""yes, gifts"".",False,False
1,"AITA for joking that it would be healthier for my brother’s small-chested overweight fiancée to just lose weight instead of getting a boob job after she said she wanted a boob job to be proportional? | I (23M) was hanging out with my brother (26M) and his fiancée (26F) at their house. When I came out of their bathroom ready to leave for the night, I saw them playing rock paper scissors (RPS). I asked them what they were playing for. There was a brief pause before she said they play RPS once a day and if she beats him seven times in a row, he would pay for her boob job. She said she has gotten to five a few times. I tease her about her weight sometimes. She’s 5’4” and 160 lbs according to my brother. She never seems offended. Neither does my brother. It’s probably because we’re all Asian and fat people are playfully shamed constantly amongst family and friends. Plus, no one in my family is overweight. I never made fun of her small boobs before because no one really jokes about that in our culture. Furthermore, my girlfriend (24F) got a boob job herself. 


After she told me what they play RPS for, I asked her why she wanted a boob job. I was confused because my brother has always told me that he preferred small, natural boobs. She said she feels disproportionate having small boobs on her frame. I joked that it would be healthier to just lose weight so her small boobs would be proportional to her thinner frame. She has been going to the gym with my brother but he says she eats too many sweets. I must have made my first sensitive joke to her, because she then said it must be nice to have a skinny girlfriend with fake boobs who’s also an Ivy League graduate and an Instagram model. She then apologized to my brother for not being perfect like my girlfriend. I have heard her talk about my girlfriend’s skinniness multiple times before, but she has never talked about my girlfriend’s boobs to me. She’s not wrong about my girlfriend’s skinniness. She is 5’7” and 110 lbs. Most importantly, I have never heard her talk in that snide tone before. 


I told her that I was just making a joke and wasn’t trying to compare her with my girlfriend. My brother said he likes his fiancée’s body the way it is, and if he really wanted her to have fake boobs, he would have bought them for her already and not make her beat him at a low probability game. He also said he wouldn’t have put a ring on her finger if he didn’t absolutely love everything about her. She then said my girlfriend is a keeper and I needed to do everything I could to keep her forever. Again, I have never heard her talk in this catty tone before. My brother told her that was enough. He said she probably had too much to drink and I should probably go. I apologized to them for ending the night on a bad tone and he said I didn’t do anything wrong and walked me down. She didn’t say anything. I don’t think she was drunk either. She has the best alcohol tolerance out of all of us and only drank about as much as we did.",False,False
0,"AITA for not listening to the person about a saved spot? | I came into Starbucks and saw a spot open and then took it. After I set up my laptop and books, the lady next to me said that spot is saved. 

I told her, I didn’t see anything here when I took the chair. She pointed to an iPad that was in front of the other chair next to me. She started arguing that the iPad should have been in the spot where I was sitting. I told her well, sorry, I have the spot now

15 minutes late a guy comes by and sits down with the iPad and says hey that spot is mine. I told the lady to save it for me. I told them that if you wanted that spot then you should have put your iPad there then.

1,"AITA for telling my wife she cannot get a tattoo? | I’m 32 M and married to 26 F. We’ve been together 6 years. 

When we met, it was obvious we had some differences of opinion on certain things. My wife loves tattoos and piercings, I hate them with a passion. I have some very strong opinions on this stuff. She expressed an interest in getting her nose pierced but I managed to convince her it would look unprofessional (her career is very important to her).

She stopped mentioning tattoos / piercings for most of our relationship. Today, January 1st, we’re talking about resolutions. My wife said she wants to be a little more adventurous and get a tattoo.

Long story short I obviously hate the idea and made that known. Of course I can’t FORBID it, but she knows how I feel about it and that it would definitely affect my attraction to her. I just think they’re ugly, end of.

She’s upset because she says I’ve always known she likes this stuff and she’s held off this long because of me. I say this has come as a shock because I thought she gave up on the idea. 

I really really don’t want her to ruin her perfect skin with a tattoo and they’re just so cliche now anyway.

1,"AITA for calling out my sister’s wife on Facebook for one-upping my baby shower? | Throwaway but I suppose it’s in vain since this is so specific.          
      
My sister and her wife were trying to make a baby in the same span of time that my husband and I were and we are both pregnant now, and about a week and a half apart in our due dates. She’s expecting twins (boy and girl), I’m expecting a little boy.      
       
We all live together so there has definitely been some tension between her and I in regards to our baby showers. We realized we had each planned ours the same day and she told me I could take the Saturday and she’d take Sunday since we had family coming from out of town and that way it’d be easier.       
             
However, our baby showers were last weekend and she blatantly one-upped me in every way. She hired herself and I a DJ, but had way more elaborate decorations and expensive food for hers. She completely transformed our backyard and our friends and family ranted and raved. She had beautiful cheese platters and little finger foods. I couldn’t afford much so mine was a pretty run of the mill baby shower, but she knew that. Seeing everyone speak so highly of her shower was infuriating. They also gave her way more gifts than myself.         
         
I posted on my Facebook— “pretty sad when you feel the need to one-up family just because you’re having one more baby than me”. She came to me in my room and told me that first of all, she didn’t have to get me a DJ but she did, that it’s not her problem that I can’t afford more lavish things, and that she’s having one more baby so her getting more gifts isn’t a jab at me, just a logical fact of having twins vs one kid. I told her that she didn’t need to get such extravagant things knowing it’d make my shower pale in comparison and she told me to fuck off and walked away.         
         
My sister sent me a long text when she was at work saying to give them space and that I’m acting like a brat. My husband agrees that she blatantly wanted to make me look bad since we had our showers a day apart, and it was clear by how much money she put into it.          
      
I think that if youre having a shower the day after your family, you shouldn’t try to do everything in your power to have a better one. Also, I think it’s shitty for family to spend more money on her than myself, twins or not. Am I the asshole here?

I was walking back to the section that I was organizing and I see that there are a bunch of toys on the floor opened from their packages. As I knelt down to pick them up, I see this boy (4-5 years old ish) just staring at me giggling. So I know it was this kid who was opening stuff. I don’t see his parents with him so I approach him and ask where his parents are and he runs away from me. So I ask my coworker to come help me talk to this kid and find his parents. He tells my coworker that his mom is off somewhere else getting her phone fixed and had left him there. We wait together until his mom arrives after ten minutes. When she arrives she has her son apologize to me and that truly made me angry. I don’t think the boy should have to apologize when the mom should’ve been there to watch him. I don’t think he’s anywhere near the age where he can be unsupervised, especially in a store in a huge mall where you never know who might be around. I ask the mom why she thought it would be a good idea to leave her son there and she tells me she was only gone a few minutes to the bathroom when he was probably there a total of 20 minutes. And I called her out and told her we watched him for 10 minutes alone and plus he told us you were off doing your own thing. She honestly believed she did nothing wrong and kept asking what she did wrong and I was just so shocked a parent could be so unaware. It was beyond frustrating.

So I am a student and I have a part time job. I work long hours and I have important standardized tests to study for to prepare for grad school as well as balance an internship.

I said “no, I am tired and I have some things to do after this shift .” He responded with : “well what do you have to do that you can’t pick up the shift.” 
I got annoyed, told him
I don’t have to explain myself . And hung up. The same instance repeats for weeks ... I pick up shifts frequently but I’m human for goodness sakes ! I need a break and have a life outside of this “part time “ job!


So a few days ago I do an on call shift . At my job the moment you clock into on call you are paid regardless . If you are on call 8AM-6PM, you are paid 10 hours even if you were only called in for 1. I called him and reminded him I am working on call Saturday . He agreed and said he would note that in my portal. I got called in for a 2 hour shift. I called Monday to clarify that I get my 10 hours and he says no I “picked up a shift I was not on call”
I lost it . I got bat crazy and tell him I need my extra 8 hours. I cleared my day on call waiting to get called in and got called in. Picking up a shift would be me calling in before or getting a choice to go in. I complained to HR , he was scolded and I got my full 10 hours and an extra 2 as well as a bonus. They apologized .

I was extremely positive I gave a $2 coin as I had already prepared it and taken it out of my wallet and it’s size is distinctly much smaller than a 1 dollar coin. I continued saying that I was pretty sure I gave you $17 but she refused to budge saying that she does not see the coin anywhere.

0,"AITA for wanting to report my friend to all the stores he rips off? | Friend has clinical OCD which may play a factor in this but he still knows it's wrong and always says he'll stop. Never does. 

Been going on for the 6 years I've known him, and who knows how long before that. 

He's been banned from ordering from Amazon and now Boxed Lunch.

What he does is:
1) Order something online
2) Receive the item and call and complain you didn't get it to get a refund
3) Take the item to the actual store and return it with no receipt for store credit 
4) Profit

I've been at the store when he ordered clothes, called and got his money back, took the clothes in and returned them but ALSO took stuff off the rack and returned them too. Store gave him a gift card. He just said it was a separate order and he didn't have the order information. Store doesn't care. They just process it.

If one store blocks him, he'll drive out of his way to another location to return stuff. As long as he can get a refund, along with getting his money back

He ordered a custom anime statue. It was delivered to an address he since moved from. He asked me to go grab it for him since I lived closer. I did. We unboxed it and everything. I log on Facebook a couple weeks later and a post happens on my timeline of him complaining to the artist that nobody called him back and he never received it. I'm like ""wtf I know you got this one!"" He just says to mind my own business. 

Am I in the wrong for wanting to report this stuff? It's annoying that he rips everyone off, and also annoying that he lies when questioned. I've been there in person for this stuff far too often, and it's uncomfortable. 

I've been at dinner where he's plucked his own hair out to put in the meal to get it comped...his dishonesty knows no bounds. 

I ordered something for him from Boxed Lunch for store picked up, forwarded him the confirmation pickup email, he picked it up and then I got an email thanking me for calling customer service. It threw up some red flags. I'm like ""is he calling claiming they we are  damaged or something"", ""did they give him a gift card or something""...luckily there's just a week delay between someone calling (I did) and getting the thank you email

0,"AITA for booting my mom & her negative attitude from the hospital room after my daughter was born? | Settle in, this'll be a long one...

New 1st time dad here to a healthy little princess born this past Thursday. Unfortunately, the joy my wife & I felt in this scenario was temporarily halted by my mother's wholly inappropriate behavior that I'm just not ok with.

Some background: my mom has always been one of those people with a massive victim complex. People she knows go out to dinner & don't invite her? Must have been intentional. A decision is made without getting her input? Must have been done on purpose to spite her. You get the idea. 

This behavior manifested heavily 5 years ago when we got married and became a sore point for a long time. Once she found out we were expecting, again the negative behaviors came out. 

Tired of her leaving a stain on every moment that should be joyous, I finally had a sitdown with her. I told her in no uncertain terms that I wasn't going to raise my daughter in a negative environment like this, that we want her to be around and involved but her attitude needs to change. I was polite but firm about all of this. She resisted at first, resorting to her usual ways & thinking I was just plotting to get away from her completely, but in the end she claimed to have understood where I was coming from and promised to try and change her tone.

Well, the big day arrives and everyone is at the hospital. Baby is born, we had some bonding time as a family, then invited the grandparents (both sides) up to meet her. On arrival we introduced her and shared her name (we'd elected to keep it a secret). My wife and I come from different religious backgrounds and thus different naming traditions. Mine is to name after a departed loved one, hers is to name after a living relative. So our compromise was to name her after my grandmother (mom's mom) who passed a while ago and make the middle name for her mom, our daughter's grand mother.

After being in the room a bit and meeting her the question inevitably comes up of how we came up with her name. So I explain and at first she's beaming that her granddaughter is named for her mother, then when we get to the middle name her face changes to a look of pure anger and she says YOU DID WHAT?!? I calmly explain again, only to get OK, folded arms and a pouting demeanor clearly displaying her disapproval at this choice. This is supposed to be a happy occasion and I finally decided enough was enough and told her it was time to go. This lead to resistance from my dad, her going off the rails again about how everything is against her, and my wife hysterical that another even has been messed up. So I told my dad flat out that this behavior is the reason why and I won't have my kid around it, that when she's ready to behave like the grandmother we want our daughter around she can return but for today we're through. Apparently according to any and all in my family I'm the asshole for stepping in this way.

I don't think I did anything wrong here, but I leave that decision up to you guys. TIA",False,False

Here's the story: I was walking home in broad daylight carrying a small bag from the grocery store. There is a very busy street, Central Ave, one street over, but really no one on the street I was on, 1st Ave. I heard someone behind me and glanced and saw a kid maybe 18 years old who was walking roughly three yards behind me and looked to be coming home from school or something.

I continued walking when about 15 seconds later he said, “excuse me, can I ask you a question?”. I really didn’t want to have a conversation so I panicked and sprinted as quickly as I could into a parking lot towards Central Ave. Right when I started running I looked back to ensure I wasn’t being followed and saw that the kid put his hands up in a non-threatening way with a look of pure hurt on his face, then said, “woah, I’m not going to…” as I was running off but I was too far away to hear anything after that and ran all the way to Central Ave.

I don't drive so I need to catch the train to/from jobs. Today is Christmas Eve, so the trains to/from the major hubs are fairly busy, though not to the point of being rammed full. I have a large suitcase, a backpack, and two fairly full shopping bags with me on this trip (Christmas shopping mostly).

When the train arrived I stowed my luggage in a suitable place, and immediately sat in the empty priority seats opposite. Part of this was convenience, and part was consideration for other passengers, as I would have been hitting them with my bags if I'd tried to go down the aisle to another seat. An important point is these are part of a bank of unreservable seats, they don't even have reservation screens above them. I put my backpack on the seat _after_ I heard the beeping that means the doors are closing for departure.

At the next stop I swung my bag back down to the floor, just in case. Cue ""Doris"". She's about 90, and thinks that the world should bow to her every whim.

""Move.""

That's it. No pleasantries, just an order barked at me. I offered her the window seat, but she wanted _both_ seats. I refused to vacate both, saying she could have the aisle _or_ the window.

She's currently sat next to me, chuntering about ""rude children"" and misuse of priority seats, and occasionally ""accidentally"" knocking her cane into my ankle (well, trying to, as she's just hitting the padding on my work trainers).

1,"AITA for wanting my girlfriend to get female friends? | My girlfriend and I have been together for just over a year, We have a pretty solid relationship in general, Except for one issue we can't seem to get past, Which is her male friends and the time they spend together.

When we first got together and talked about our friends, She discribed her friend group as mixed but more guys than girls, This struck me as odd but since they all seemed to hang out in one big group I didn't have a problem with it.

Within a few months however, all the other girls had stopped hanging in the group, Some were dating guys in the group and they broke up (My GF always sided with the guys in these instances) a couple moved out of the city for work or school. Within six months of our initial conversation, Her friend group had turned almost exclusively male (She does have a couple female friends, But they aren't close) She'd be going out to bars with groups of 4-8 guys on the weekend, Going to parties at their houses, Sometimes staying on their couches (I'd offer to pick her up and drive her home, But they have a tradition of all getting breakfast together the morning after a party) 

I started to have a problem with this pretty quickly, It was different when it was a mixture, But having my girlfriend alone with guys all the time was weird and it just didn't sit right with me.
I pretty sure she doesn't want to bang any of them, But I'd bet at least a couple want to bang her.

0,"AITA for ending my friendship because my best friend was a bridezilla? | So my best friend (22f) was in an on-off relationship for several years. I never really liked her then boyfriend, and never really supported the relationship. The guy can't hold a job, and there were many times that she had to have 2 jobs to pay his portion of the bills. Then they broke up and she chased after some other guy, and when he ghosted her, she was suddenly engaged to first guy and gave 3 months to plan the wedding. I was her MOH, and I live a few states away from her. So I kept my opinion of the wedding to myself. I offered to buy all the wedding favors, decorations, etc and she turned down every offer. 

We got into several arguments because she said I wasn't helping like I should be, but being several states away, there was only so much I could do except for offer to help financially. And it honestly pissed me off that I was doing everything I possibly could and she still wasn't happy. 

Fast forward, I go down for the wedding with my then 11 month old. Keep in mind that I drove 8 hours without my husband, with an 11 month old, for this wedding. I stayed in town for a week so that I could do all the bridesmaids events. I was staying with my parents, who still had to work. She was upset that I was bringing my son to everything, but then was upset if i said i couldn't do something because i had my kid. She genuinely was mad that my family wasn't available to watch him so it really felt like a lose lose for me. 

Bachelorette party rolls around, we were all pretty trashed. She thought I was passed out drunk and started trash talking my husband. That was kinda the final straw for me. I have never trashed her now husband to anyone. He doesn't abuse her, doesn't call her names, so therefor it isn't my place to say what I think. So I was extremely upset. And the whole party her friend was asking me weird questions that you just dont ask in everyday conversation. The questions made it very obvious that she had been talking about me.

I go to the wedding, give my MOH speech, and stayed the entire reception, where my kid wasn't allowed (kid free reception) but she wanted him to be a ring bearer (which is why i brought him out of town with me). That whole trip was hell on me physically and financially. So after all was said and done I decided to just quietly distance myself from her because I was so upset at how I had been treated for those 3 months. 

She sent me a message asking why I've been so quiet and I told her that I thought she treated me really poorly and her saying that it was HER wedding was not an excuse to treat her best friend that way. Basically it blew up, she started trashing me on facebook so now i have her blocked everywhere.

My mom actually offered to do the dishes on my sisters days which surprised me because she’s never really helped out with the chores much.

First week of summer comes along and I do my dishes like usual. When it came to my moms turn she didn’t do them right away. She waited 2 maybe 3 weeks before doing them. It got so bad that I’d have to wash myself a dish to eat off of for every meal. Eventually she did do them. Half of them.

She loaded them into the dishwasher (the same dishwasher she has claimed “doesn’t clean the dishes enough”. We’ve always hand washed them) and most came out pretty clean. But she only did half and the rule usually is that if you don’t finish the dishes you have to finish them before the next person does them.

She said that she’d finish the dishes the next day. I believed her because she had actually done half of them this time.

She didn’t do them.

Now she’s waited about 4 weeks to do them. But this time she’s claiming that the dishes aren’t rinsed enough and she’s not doing them so it’s my turn.

(A little backstory here is that for a VERY long time me and my sister have constantly complained about her not rinsing her dishes AT ALL. She either ignores us or says that she made the food so she shouldn’t have to. She rarely cooks.)

Admittedly yes there are about 6 dishes that aren’t rinsed nearly enough and that’s likely my fault. Also there are quite a few peanut butter knives that are poorly rinsed. But there’s also a large amount of perfectly rinsed dishes in there.

1,"WIBTA if I gave money to charity as part of secret santa at work tradition, instead of a material gift? | We have a secret santa tradition at work - my company is about 30 employees, so each draws someone else that they will be gifting to. You give to someone else than gives to you.

The recommended amount is about 20$. 

I decided that I'd like to give a 20$ donation to a reputable charity (environmental or animal rights/shelter) and give the confirmation of such given amount in their name on paper to my giftee. I decided to do that because some people received pretty shitty gifts last year (me included) and this is something that will do good and has a zero chance of ending up in the trash or some drawer. 

However, my concern is that it may be unfair to give to a charity that I consider a good charity (because it may seem like I wanted to give to a charity, but also needed a gift, so I combined them and didn't really take the wish of my giftee into consideration). Also I will be receiving a regular gift most likely, but will be giving a non-material gift to someone else. I'd love to receive the same instead of some crap like last year, but that's unfortunately not possible. However, I'm afraid it could be a slight asshole move to receive a regular gift but not give one, even if said gift may end up in the trash.

1,"AITA for not wanting to deal with my gfs “depression”? | So my gf and I have been dating for about 8 months and for the most part things are pretty good.  However, with all that’s going on she’s not working and is basically just staying at home all day.  I’m still working, and when I get home the first thing I have to hear is how hard her day was since she had nothing to do.  She talks about how she’s feeling depressed, and quite frankly I’m tired of it. I heard her out for the first couple days, but now it’s the same thing every day.  

She’s literally able to sleep in and watch Netflix every day til I get home from work.  Yesterday I had a rough day at work and was in a bad mood, so when she was telling me how hard she had it I told her that I don’t want to hear it anymore.  She’s not depressed, she’s just bored.  There are people literally dying and she’s complaining about such insignificant things.

0,"AITA for getting mad about my mom not cleaning? | Okay so some background information.

I'm 16 my mom is 31 she works her ass off at work (which is at night) to make sure we have a roof over our head and food on the table and this is something I adamantly respect about her. But I work too and go to school and clean the whole house and take care of my sister basically single handedly cause even if my mom is home she's almost always asleep or watching TV not paying attention to her. And I keep my space pretty clean its not perfect but like its livable. And I get being tired from work I really do.

BUT JESUS FUCKING CHRIST SHE HAS NO PROBLEM LIVING IN FILTH OR MAKING OTHERS LIVE IN FILTH

Some examples:

-Her boxes of stuff she refuses to get rid of are literally everywhere. We hardly have a living room

-She let's food mold in her room and then takes it to the kitchen and tells me to do the disgusting moldy dishes

-She never rinses her dishes off

-She never cleans up after herself, there's  constantly trash and food she didn't eat and drinks she didn't drink and misc. dishes from her all over the place

-She never puts in any effort to keep the house clean I.E. vacuuming, dishes, taking the garbage out, cleaning the bathroom. She just let's it get gross until I get pissed off and take care of it

1,"AITA for throwing out a box of things that belonged to my boyfriend’s former girlfriend? | My BF [28M] and I [26F] have been dating nearly 2 years. We moved in together last year.

From the ages of 20 to 25, he dated his previous GF. She broke up with him due to work and busy lives. That was her official excuse, but he told me that she was just “really afraid of settling down with me”. From what I gathered, she was his first love.

6 months after they broke up, we started dating. At first I was apprehensive because his ex was this beautiful, gorgeous model. I voiced my insecurities to my BF, but he promised me that he was ready to put her in the past. We even attended her wedding recently. He was emotional and even tearing up, but nearly every guest was.

My BF  has a large walk in closet with his things. When I moved in, he let me use the spare room as a closet because his closet was full. My BF is pretty neat but his closet gets messy fast. Due to work (and the weekly housekeeper being sick) he has no time to clean it, so I decided to clean it myself.

He’s never explicitly told me not to go inside his closet. I’ve been inside a few times, but mostly I have no reason to. Anyways, I got to organizing, and when I opened a drawer, I noticed a shoe box. It was pretty light for shoes so I opened it and found a nearly empty bottle of perfume, an old iPhone 4 with a cracked screen, a single mitten, and a lock of dark wavy hair.

The phone was nearly fully charged and could turn on. There was a passcode and the background image was a picture of a dog, which I recognized to be my BF’s dog that his ex GF gifted him. And the hair was probably hers too. I had never felt more betrayed in my life. I took the phone out, put the box in a bag, and threw it down the trash chute.

When my BF came home, I confronted him by showing him the phone. He looked bewildered and I told him how I found it. I asked him why she still had his ex’s phone. He told me that he had bought her the latest iphone one year for her birthday, so she no longer used the old phone, and he kept it instead. He admitted. to charging it periodically, said he didnt want to “lose any of the old photos of my dog and stuff”. Bullshit, iCloud exists.

Anyways he asked me where the box is. I told him the rest looked like trash so I threw it out. He was livid. He yelled at me and said I had no business throwing out his belongings. I told him, “they’re not yours. They’re your ex-girlfriend’s.”

I told him I deserved an explanation as to why he still kept his ex’s shit. Evidently he keeps going back to the box because the phone is 65% charged and its an old IPHONE. My BF admitted to smelling the perfume “once in a while” because the scent was “comforting and relaxing”. He says he is not reminded of her by it at all, its purely for platonic purposes.

Anyways, I’ve since been sleeping at my sister’s place. AITA for throwing the box out? It was basically trash, and plus he  is probably emotionally cheating on me by hanging on to “memories”.",False,False
1,"AITA for commenting on how much my daughter had eaten? | My 20 year old daughter arrived home after a day of work just after 6. She cooks her own meals because she eats a vegan diet and we (her parents/my husband and I) do not. She usually reheats a dinner/cooks alongside me in the kitchen to make her own meal which works well. 

She commented once about how hungry she was and looking forward to dinner and at about 7 we sat down. She was having a bean and vegetable soup she’d made a few days before and portioned out into servings and toast and we were having a different meal. After we finished, I jokingly lifted up her empty bowl and said “Well YOU must have been hungry, didn’t leave a thing!” And she looked at me a little annoyed and said well I worked all day and it was just a single bowl of soup and toast. I said yes but you ate alllll of it. She just said she doesn’t comment on how much we eat and it made her feel awkward because she didn’t really know how to respond. She then asked me if I would’ve said that to her father or brother had they eaten the amount she’d just eaten. I honestly said no but that’s because they probably would’ve eaten even a bit more being grown men.

1,"AITA for going on a trip after my GF was uninvited? | Back in March, my best friend (BFF) started planning a trip to Costa Rica (CR) to celebrate her graduation in May. I asked BFF if my girlfriend\* (GF) could come. BFF said of course. When I told GF about the trip, she was really excited. BFF & I have been BFF for 3 years. 

\*I should say that GF & I are ‘just dating.’  We’re basically a couple & are exclusive. But neither of us has wanted to commit to the boyfriend/GF label. I call her GF here, but technically she isn't. We’ve been together 1 year.

&#x200B;

In mid-April, BFF told me she didn’t want GF to go on the trip anymore. I was devastated. I knew GF would not take it well. BFF cited GF’s indecisiveness & inability to go with the flow sometimes as reasons. I tried to talk BFF out of it, but it was no use. BFF also said she only wanted her closest friends on the trip. Since it was BFF’s graduation trip, & her parents gave her some money for it, it was hard to argue with BFF. The trip was now just: me, BFF,  BFF's boyfriend, and BFF's other close friend (a guy).

Now I should say that BFF is moving 4 states away soon for a job, so this will be like the ‘last hurrah’. 

When I told GF the bad news a few days later, GF was predictably really upset. GF asked if I was planning to go to CR without her, and I said that I wanted to.  (Thankfully, me & GF hadn't bought plane tickets yet). GF was teary-eyed and I could see how hurt she was. She asked for a few days apart to cool off, and we agreed to talk again then. 

Well, GF & I can hardly stand to be apart and we had lunch the next day. Things were kinda tense but she didn’t bring up the trip. A few days later, things seemed to be back to normal and I bought my tickets to CR.

&#x200B;

Then in May, right before the trip, it seemed like every little thing pissed GF off. She finally admitted:

(1) She was really hurt that I didn't stand up for her when BFF uninvited her. I told GF how much I tried to get BFF to change her mind but it didn’t matter.   GF thinks I should have been willing to not go since she couldn't go.

(2) She thinks the real reason she was uninvited is BFF has feelings for me. (BFF asked me out 2 years ago; I said no).  BFF is planning to break up with her boyfriend after the trip, and BFF sometimes criticizes her boyfriend to me, and GF said this was ‘proof’ BFF still likes me, and said I chose someone petty and manipulative over her. 

(3) She was mad that I bought my plane tickets without knowing she was ok with it.

&#x200B;

I wish I would have handled things better but I couldn’t do anything about it at that point. 

I'm in CR now and when GF & I talk on the phone, it’s clear GF is still so angry. I am trying to be understanding of her mood, but I think she’s being unreasonable for being this mad for this long, especially since she didn’t tell me how she felt until right before I left.  Also, I think it would have been unfair of GF to ask me not to go, since I will hardly get to see BFF once she moves.

We settled on the 1st of the month for me to give her the money. Most of her bills come out on the 3rd. 


That’s been fine except sometimes she asks me to pay early because she wants to “get this bill out of the way”. For example, we have a bachelorette party coming up this weekend and she wants me to pay her for my half of the utility bills before we go so she doesn’t have to worry about saving money for it while on our trip. 


This isn’t the first time she’s asked to do this. I explained to her that i have other bills to pay outside of our household bills and I can’t just pay her whenever she feels like it. We agreed on a date and I won’t be paying before that date. She said “I just don’t understand how you can not have money for bills right now but will after we get back from vacation”. I responded “it’s not that I don’t have the money. Unlike you, I don’t have a credit card or access to my parents bank and that’s why I can’t just give this money up before it’s due”.

0,"WIBTA if I uninvited my the best man's EX-girlfriend to our wedding? | Okay, so my future husband and i are getting married in about a month, intimate wedding overseas. FH has a very dear friend Rob, who we both love and has been FH's best friend since they were very young. 

He had been dating a girl for several years, who I never really cared for, there is a significant maturity/age gap between us, and I have never felt the need to be her friend, but I've always been friendly. About a month ago, she broke up with Rob because she wanted to see other people. Since they broke up, she has been taking advantage of him financially (going on a trip they had scheduled to DC on her own instead of paying him back for the ticket, living in their house rent-free until she finds her own place, calling him to help her take care of \[their\] dog she is keeping in the breakup etc.)  
So FH and I have been encouraging Rob to stop communicating with her, calling him out when he bends over backwards for her etc. However last week, we found out that he hasn't gotten a refund for the plane ticket he bought her to go to our wedding... and that she's still planning on coming. 

  
FH called Rob out about how she is being incredibly disrespectful toward him to think that she would be welcome to come, despite their breakup, (he'll be paying for most of it, since she doesn't have money). Rob ended up telling FH ""you have to tell her she can't come"". (worth noting that FH also does not consider ex-gf a friend, especially not now).  
I don't want to put that on FH, he has so much going on with work etc, so I'm thinking of sending a text to her that says something along the lines of ""Hi ex-gf, Rob mentioned you were still planning on coming to our wedding, however it would cause a lot of tension and I do not want that on our wedding day. I cannot stop you from coming to \[country\] but it comes across as selfish and disrespectful to Rob if you were to go on this trip.""

1,"AITA: Girlfriend lied to me, and she’s upset at me for getting upset | Using a throwaway because obvious reasons.

My girlfriend and I decided to do a diet together. I’ve wanted to lose some weight for some time and she wanted to join me to eat healthier and support me. I could tell she was kind of skeptical of the diet and probably wouldn’t make it the whole 30 days on it. She seemed grossly underprepared to do it and hasn’t even read about it before the day of. I’ve done the diet a few times before and know how to navigate and plan well for it.

We started a couple weeks ago. All was going well one week in. We went out to dinner at a restaurant that complied with the diet- she found it and ate the food there and everything.

Then last Saturday, we were heading to my brothers for game night. I picked her up. While I was waiting for her to finish getting ready, I hung out with her roommate. He was making food and offered me some that was breaking the diet and that she had eaten some.

So I went upstairs and asked her if she ate one. She told me no. She lied right to my face. When we went back down, her roommate pulled her aside. I can only guess she figured out I knew because she came running out to me and said “Please let me explain!” I was fuming at her lying so easily to me that I just kept walking.

We got in the car and she was crying but I kept ignoring her. Halfway there, she asked to be dropped off and said she didn’t want to go. I told her we couldn’t play the games unless she came and she was going to ruin the whole night for everyone because she was upset that she got caught lying.

She told me she was going to tell me that night after games. I asked her if she had even accomplished any days in the diet and she said she made it into the second day and got faint at work. She said she almost passed out and her coworkers had to feed her stuff that was breaking the diet. She said she can’t afford to pass out at work (she’s a teacher) but she could just find other recipes on the diet to do or put in more effort to make it work. And now her coworkers all think I’m a jerk.

I was so livid about that, about her lying right to my face, and about her reason for not telling me. She said she was worried I’d be upset (I’m upset that she LIED but I wouldn’t have been upset that she stopped the diet) and that she wanted to be supportive of my diet and let me get through the first few days of it before she told me she wasn’t doing it. She said she was also worried we would fight about it so she wanted to wait until we had a discussion on a weekend night instead of a work day. She swears she was going to tell me that night.

I dropped her off after game night and told her I’d let her know when I wanted to talk. I texted her the next day that I loved her. She wrote back that my reaction was concerning to her. So that made me upset all over again. I don’t know what to do now or if this is concerning behavior form HER.",False,False

1,"AITA for telling the barista that my girlfriend is with me? | Basically I'm 25m and she's 23F.

She gets company credit for food and drinks as she works for like a week at a time. She cooks all her own food and uses that money to buy a coffee each morning. She always goes to the same coffee shop. 

Me and my gf are very comfortable and she's bi so sometimes we will both say how hot a girl is or whatever. She always says the guy who serves her coffee is ""beautiful"", she confirmed that she wasn't attracted to him but that he was stunning and a very pretty man. That was fine. 

Anyway, so she goes in every day and always has stories to tell about the guy behind the counter. I trust her ENTIRELY, I know she doesn't really want him and wouldn't do anything. 

Anyway, I went in the other day and straight away knew who she meant as this gorgeous long haired dude took my order. I ordered her favourite drink as she was at home and I shit you not he said ""oh is that for Emma?"" And when I looked shocked he went ""I just know that's her usual, no one else really orders it"". I said yes, it is but by the way pal, she has a boyfriend and it's me. The guy kinda laughed and i said that I appreciate he's doing his job but to lay off her as in my eyes, I think he was flirting. He laughed again and said sure thing. 


I didn't tell my gf who went to get coffee a few days later and came home raging, saying how dare I embarrass her like that. This pissed me off cause why doesn't she want him to know?! She said she already mentioned me and that the guy is gay and she knows his boyfriend.

1,"AITA for how I treat my son? | So, I'm a mother of two. (19F) and (16M). My son has always been a very well behaved kid, but he's been off recently. He has been diagnosed with anxiety & severe depression, but I think that his psychiatrist is overdramatic.


Recently, he: 1. went to the ER because he was having trouble breathing and swallowing. His sister called the hospital & brought him in on their recommendation. I asked her if he was just being dramatic, but she snapped at me & ignored my advice to wait. My son gave me the cold shoulder as well.

2. He got in a minor accident. He didn't pull over when I called him because he ""assumed it was an emergency"" since ""I called and immediately started yelling."" So he was distracted, & swerved to avoid hitting a dog. He said he'd pay for the car, but I refused to talk to him about it because I didn't want to yell.


He told my husband that he was stressed, having severe depression, & was thinking about inpatient. My husband & I agree that that won't help him. I asked if his friends were the problem, but he got defensive & said it wasn't their fault. I pointed out that nothing in his life should be stressing him out. He doesn't have a hard life & he doesn't tell us when something is wrong because ""we stress him out"" & ""make it worse."" He has mentioned having issues recently, but didn't make it clear that it was a big deal. 


He's been talking this year about moving out. He's graduating early, but I don't think he can & have discouraged it. He has never gotten below a B, but if he's already stressed, then I don't see why he would graduate & move out early. 2 of his friends are graduating, & he mentioned that he would probably stay over at their place a lot next year, which I also discouraged & told him that I wanted to see him. I've mentioned several times about my nostalgia for how he acted when he was younger, & how I don't want him moving out, but he gets all quiet & says he was so well behaved because he was ""extremely depressed"" as a child & ""had no friends."" 


He's made comments implying that he doesn't care about family bonds & has trouble getting close to people. He's said that he feels more for the people he chooses to be close to than for family he's forced to be close to. It's really upsetting to me & we've argued after he says that he doesn't want to be around his extended family. He's never said that he doesn't want a strong relationship with me, but when asked, he did say that if I estranged myself from him, he would cut me off.

My boyfriend and I live together. A few years ago, I moved here from out of state and met him. We moved in together about a year later and have been together 3 years.

Since I moved, I haven't made many friends. I'm out of college and work from home, so it's hard to meet new people. Every year around my birthday, I get really depressed now because back home I used to have huge parties to celebrate every year, but now I know like 4 people other than my boyfriend, and not super well. 

This year I decided to try to have fun anyway. I talked to my BF and set up a facebook event, made plans to go to a restaurant I like here, and invited everyone I know in town.

Everyone declined my invite. It was crushing. I was devastated and it really made me feel like I had no friends here at all. I wound up canceling the event and cried almost every day for the next two weeks, often sobbing on my boyfriend's shirt over it. I felt totally rejected, and every time he'd just try to soothe me by telling me how much he cares and that we'd do something ""just the two of us"" instead.

On my birthday, we went out to dinner together. I ruined my makeup, crying at dinner over the situation despite trying not to. It was painful.

When we got home, we opened the door to find my friends waiting, yelling surprise! The reason they all canceled on my event? My boyfriend had told them to, so he could do this instead.

The party was fun and all, but I feel betrayed by my boyfriend. He thinks I'm crazy and that the positive of the party I got should override any pain that I went through before it. I think he watched me sob my eyes out for two weeks over a problem he created, knowing the whole time he could tell me the truth and fix everything - and instead had me thinking everyone I know here hates me.

Usually I brush his comments off but this time I was more annoyed and I told him that his comment was rude and if he's going to complain then he isn't allowed to eat the bread. I told him he should apologize when he makes rude comments and he stormed off into his room.

I feel kind of bad because he is just a kid and he was also really excited to eat the bread, but I don't think I was being unfair to want an apology because it takes time and effort to cook and to have someone not be appreciative is hurtful.

My son is 23 and has cerebral palsy that is quite severe. It only affects him physically. He is very smart. I have recently setup his financials where he gets his disability sent to  him directly and got him his own place. 

His caregiver visits him daily at his new place. I did this because I wanted my son to be independent. 

He did very well for a few months but recently he has gotten into a relationship with a 58 year old man that I simply do not approve of.

It's not that I'm homophobic. But it's the fact that this man older then me has now moved in with my son. They've only known each other for three months.

And what's worse is that my son isn't gay. I had a heartfelt conversation where my son broke down and admitted he isn't gay but is scared of dying alone.

I have been heartbroken ever since and tried to setup some counseling sessions only to find out that his partner is double booking activities on those days and forcing my son to choose.

I'm not sure what this older man's deal is. He is contributing around 25% of the rent and seems to work.

Last Sunday I had them over for lunch and I couldn't control myself. I called him a predator and I thought he was disgusting. He then proceeded to take it on himself to physically push my son out the house without even asking.

My son called me after and said that what I did was wrong and I don't understand his predicament.

My girlfriend eats a lot. Like, a lot a lot. She always says that she is one of those people who can eat whatever she wants but doesn't gain weight. She's very active and is slim now, but she's 30 and she's adopted so she has no idea what her birth mom's body looked like after 30. We went out to dinner on Tuesday and she ordered an appetizer, dinner, and dessert. This was an Applebees-tier place so it was not only a lot of food but probably over 2000 calories. Watching her stuff herself put me off my meal a little because it was just so much food, and she always eats like this.

When we got home, I laid it out for her that I'm worried about her health and her weight in the future if she keeps eating like this.

1,"AITA for wanting my college savings despite not going to college? | I'm going to be a High School Senior this upcoming school year and I've made the decision to not to go to university. I've kinda always been planning to go to college after high school, but never had any idea what to study and still don't. 
This summer I was hired by a family friend (let's call him Bob) to help out with his electrician business. I thought I'd be doing office work, but I'm actually on the field doing the work with him. I ended up loving the work and Bob loves having me. He offered to keep me hired during the school year and after I graduate I can officially start my apprenticeship with him. I told him yes. 
My parents at first weren't too thrilled. They always wanted me to go to university. But they changed their minds after I talked to them so more about it. I told them that electricians make good money and I wouldn't have to go to college for 4 years and spend $80k on a degree. They agreed with my decision.
But now they told my siblings and I that now they can using my college savings for my siblings' education. I have an older sister who just finished her sophomore year in college and a younger sister who just finished her sophomore year in high school. 
As far as I know the college savings for all 3 of us are in one bank account by my parents. My siblings and I haven't put any of our money into it (we each have our own general savings account). The college money is all from our parents that they saved up over the years. They said they have enough for 3 years of tuition and room and board for the 3 of us. I'm not sure on the exact amount, but by that estimate my share would be around $60k. 
I told my parents that it wasn't fair for them to give away that money to my siblings. My parents think I'm being selfish as now they'd be able to pay for all 4 years for my 2 sisters and still have some left over in case they want to go to grad school. They said being able to graduate debt free would be huge for my sisters. 
I think I should just get my $60k and use it how I see fit. I'll probably start a retirement account and look into certificates and investments. 

So AITA for wanting my college savings despite not going to college?",False,False
1,"AITA for breaking up with someone after they completely supported me for 3 years? | Hello. I started university at 28 after some injuries left me unable to work in my previous job. I started dating someone who already had an established career. They basically let me focus only about school so I finished it in 3 years. I found a job after that and started working right away. Pretty quickly after I was more independen, I started to not be attracted to the person I was dating. I broke up with them after three months of feeling like this. They basically told me that the only reason I dated them was for their money. On some level I think it might be true, but am I an asshole for that?

Never cheated or anything like that
They took it pretty hard
I didn't really try to work on it, just broke up and I felt pretty happy

Upon hearing this my roommate insisted no one would get the costume as its far too obscure. This sparked long (and stupid) debate that led to our bet. If five people recognized who I was then I win $50 . To me this seemed like easy money. However, leading up to the party i found out that my girlfriend could no longer go and that the pieces I wanted to order would take too long to arrive so I never put the costume together and we just stayed in that night instead. He is adamant that as I didn't get five people to recognize me that night (as I was sitting at home) that I lost the bet and owe him the money.

1,"AITA for telling my girlfriend to stop talking about me with her friends? | Alright so she spends like 3-4 hours a day talking/playing with friends online and so obviously I come up quite frequently just to get the conversation going. I ABSOLUTELY hate it. Like she’ll talk about where we live (I don’t want people I’ve never met to know where I live) she talks about my hobbies, what I do, my friends. What I do online, basically just whatever comes to mind that isn’t considered private I suppose. I’m not one for causing a scene or anything so I usually keep quiet but today I was in a foul mood and sort of low-key yelled at her to stop talking about me and she got upset and went to bed without a word

0,"AITA for building a 7ft high wall around our backyard without asking our neighbors? | 
My wife and I bought a house with this nice big yard. When we bought it didn’t have a fence or wall around it at all. We wanted to build a tall totally enclosed wall all around our yard to have more privacy and make it safer yard for our dogs.

We only have one house right next to us. An older couple lives there. We were going to talk to them about building the wall, but they never seemed to be home. We learned from a neighbor across the street that they had gone to deal with a family issue. They didn’t know when they would be back and didn’t have any contact information.

After a month though they still weren’t back so we decided to go through with building the wall. We checked the city restrictions and decided to get someone to check the property lines again just in case and built our wall next to our neighbors three foot wall that surrounded their property. We figured they would want to keep their wall as is because they have built in flower beds.

Our neighbors came back today, about 2-3 weeks after the wall was built. We went and chatted with them for a while they were unloading their bags and everything seemed friendly. Then we left to go out for lunch and a movie.

When we got back home around 5 our neighbor came over and knocked on our door. I was in the shower at this time so I’ll let my wife relay what he said.

Basically he said we were very inconsiderate to build our wall without even asking them. 

He said the wall casts a bunch of shade now in their backyard even in the middle of the day. (The sun goes across the southern sky here and our house is on the south side of theirs so that’s probably true).

At the end he said how he and his wife just went to help with her dying sister and now she comes home to her favorite plants dying and having to look at an ugly wall instead of nature reserve next to us.",False,False
1,"AITA for not allowing my daughter to buy expensive things because I can’t afford the same for her siblings? | Some background:

I married my first husband, and we had one child. We divorced when she was four. I married my current when she was six. She recently turned 16, let’s call her Alice. 

My husband and I have two children together. He also has a daughter from a previous relationship that is 15 (less than a month younger than my daughter) let’s call her Jane. 

When my ex-husband and I divorced, he was in law school. He is now a lawyer and does very well for himself. 

Alice was not doing well in school during her freshman year. She and her father struck up a deal that if she made all As he would give her an increase in her allowance. 

She made all As in the first semester. Her father increased her allowance from $65 a week to *$250* a week. He and I had an argument about this. I think it is entirely too much money. I can’t afford to give Jane the same treatment. I caved and told her that she was required to save some of it each week. 

Alice has had the allowance for about two months, and she is starting to buy very expensive items. It is making Jane resentful. The latest thing she wanted to buy was an Apple Watch. Jane has been asking for one for several months, I told her that I couldn’t afford it but would get her a Fitbit. 

When Alice told me she was going to buy the Apple Watch, I told her that it wouldn’t be fair to her sister. I told her she could buy a Fitbit like the one I was giving Jane, but the Apple Watch was off the table. 

She got very upset with me and ran to tell her father. He and I have been arguing for a couple of days. I have actually doubled down since then and told her that she can’t buy any items that I deem too expensive. If she does she must leave them at her fathers house. 

She is refusing to talk to me or her sister, and I’m starting to feel bad but still think that Alice is getting unfair treatment. Am I in the wrong here? Am I being an asshole?",False,False
0,"AITA for using 1/3 of my aunt's money to fix my house? | Some background: My uncle died about a year ago with no will, no life insurance, and no savings. They owned a home together. My aunt had a job managing a convenience store but had to stop working because she got sick. With only her social security money coming in, she was in a bad way and couldn't afford her bills. This January she was very sick with cancer and I was in the position to buy a home. I purchased the home for above what it was worth because my aunt needed money. The house is run down, infested with fleas and termites, cat pee embedded into the grout and walls, a large neglected yard, and all surfaces covered in 20 yrs worth of a pack a day nicotine. I moved into one half of the house and my aunt had the other half.

Currently: She passed away last week. With no will despite all of the family begging her to make one for the past 4 months. She had listed me as POA and beneficiary of her bank accounts because she believed I would make the good choices about the money from the home sale. Before she passed, we had discussed improvements she wanted to do to the home, such as remodeling the kitchen because of a decade old leaky dishwasher that ruined the cabinets and wall behind them and rescreening the back porch (she placed a deposit on this before she passed).

About 70k is left. About 4-5k is going to fix up her cats for adoption (they all 4 have several medical problems), 2k for the cremation, 10k to hold back for the family to come together and scatter her ashes sometime next year, 25k for me to fix the house, and 20k min for 8 of the cousins/step kids to split. There is about 9k left over that if no other expenses are foreseen, would also go into the cousin fund. So the cousins would get 2,500 -3,675 each

There is also an SUV that my aunt paid off and verbally said she would give to my mom. Mom thinks it is too big for her, so I offered to trade my car to her for the SUV.

My other aunts are mad because I am taking so much money AND getting the car. (The car was a deal just between my mom and I.) I need the money to fix the house into a livable condition and I would be doing most of the repairs myself to save expenses. There would be no money to split if I hadn't purchased the house. I feel that because the house needs so many repairs and because my aunt was going to do these repairs if she had survived , I should take the money and get the house in good condition. If I had not wanted to help my aunt out of poverty, I would have purchased a home that was in good shape. 

My other aunts want the ~55k to be split evenly between just the 6 cousins, leaving out my uncles kids from a previous marriage. The step kids got nothing from their father's death and I felt they should get something.

1,"AITA for telling my sister that her beating breast cancer was not impressive and not inspirational? | Three years ago my older sister was diagnosed with breast cancer. Within six months her cancer was cleared. She had minor radiAtion and then hormone therapy afterwards. She is 100% fine and healthy no need for surgery.

We all came together and supported her during this time. Now, the thing has been is that she hasn’t stopped to remind us constantly about how she is a cancer survivor. And has made it her identity.

She has since plastered it all over social media. I don’t mind it because I can choose to ignore it. 

But this holiday season she was insufferable. My breaking point happened when my dad who has been dealing with nerve problems was telling us how physical therapy wasn’t working for him and he will likely need to get surgery. My sister started bringing up her cancer story again.

I snapped and told her that her surviving breast cancer was not impressive nor inspiration, it has a survival rate of 96% and to stop making everything about her story.

My son turned 18 on monday and got his full license, he takes the bus to highschool now or my wife or I drop him and his sister off when we have the time. I spoke to her about getting him a car in dec for his 18th bday in january since he got his full license and he's going to be going to university away and needs a way around in the town the uni is in. She agreed and I told her that I wanted to get him a new benz for like 65k, she was totally against it. I told her my reasoning which was I've been working my ass off since I was a kid in order to buy nice things for my family, he's a good kid who has never got into trouble and he's been getting straight A's all throughout highshcool and got into a very competitive engineering program, and it won't affect us financially at all. She was still against it for some reason, but I went ahead and bought him it and gave it to him today. He was super happy and very appreciative, and I was extremely happy that I could get my son a car like that. 

When my wife came home she saw the car in the driveway and she was super pissed, I've never seen her like that before and I legit thought she was gonna stab me. She was mad because I hid the purchase from her and that I disobeyed her, I told her that we won't be giving it back so she needs to just be an adult and deal with it. I reminded her again that this doesn't even dent us and she's just being irrational, I think she's pissed because he has a nicer car than her now but she's a terrible driver who'd total a Benz/bmw in a week. But I told her that if she wants I can upgrade her car as well, she called me an asshole and said that a 18 yr old doesn't need a benz. Yeah obviously not, I could have bought him a 1999 civic but I don't grind this hard for nothing. I work this hard to enjoy life on occasion.

Growing up I was poor, that 65k was over 3 times the amount my parents made combined when I was his age and my parents never got me anything.

0,"AITA for not covering for a customer who was short $4? | This isn't a huge deal, but I'm curious as to how other people see this considering how others acted towards me afterwards. I'm an 18 year old girl who is a cashier at a grocery store. A woman who comes in relatively often to get groceries and whatever else. She's pretty ""older"", she's clearly not all completely there, and not to sound like I'm judging or rude, but she looks a little rough, as in like she doesn't have a lot of money.

Anyways, normally when she comes in she takes a good while to pay. She takes her time to get the cash out, which is the only way she pays. It's always super squished up, wadded up and crumpled up bills and she takes her time un-crumpling them as she hands me them. Sometimes she'll give me an amount and it'll be short of a couple dollars and I'll have to tell her multiple times that she's short a couple dollars before she pays the rest. And each time I've been that she clearly has those couple dollars in her hand or put back into her purse. That's only happened a couple of times out of me checking her out.

Last night I was checking her items out and there was a line forming behind her. With it being a Sunday, the first of the month, and the Superbowl, you can imagine how hectic it got and how I was just trying to speed through the line. As she pays, she does her usual take-forever-to-pay routine. She ends up being short four dollars and I tell her that as I recount the money again to make sure I didn't miss a bill. I didn't miss any, she was still short four dollars, which I told her again because she acted like she hadn't heard me. She stood there not saying anything and not moving. If she didn't have the money, she could have easily told me to take an item or two off and she would have had enough money. Instead, after me telling her for the third time, the customers behind her hand me a five dollar bill. She looked over at them and said thank you, and eyed me like I did something wrong. The people who handed me the five to cover her also looked at me weird as well.

Was I expected to cover for her? Am I the asshole for not covering for an elderly woman in that situation?",False,False
0,"AITA for being upset that my mom is trying to pay me and my fiancé to read the Bible? | Backstory: I’m currently 22 and live with my fiancé (also 22) in our own apartment. Both of us were raised Christian although we had very different experiences. Neither of us identify as Christians anymore and religion isn’t something that either of us really care about or enjoy talking about.

My mother on the other hand is a devout born again Christian and has a tendency to ask me really direct questions that I don’t enjoy talking to her about (example: in high school she used to ask me if I was a lesbian just out of the blue from time to time since I didn’t have a boyfriend). Well, a few years back this lead to her just asking me if I still believed in god to which I told her that I didn’t really know and that I didn’t want to discuss it further. She freaked out and started crying and has occasionally tried to convert me ever since.

Well, this weekend she came to visit me for my birthday. It was the first time I’ve seen her in about a year so I was pretty excited. When she got here everything was fine but on the second night of her stay she says she has a birthday present for me and then proceeds to hand me my old bible (which I told her she could keep multiple times). Then she tells me to open it. When I do, there are two $100 checks- one for myself and one for my fiancé. She told me that we each need to read the book of John and then we can cash the checks.

Now, I have nothing against any religion. I am a firm believer that people should be able to do or practice whatever they want as long as they are not harming others. But personally, I want nothing to do with this. I feel offended that she would bring that book into my home and then try to pay me and my fiancé to read it. But I also don’t know what to do with it. I can’t just throw it away so now I feel stuck with it. I still want the $200 so I’m also probably going to read it despite feeling like I’m going against my own beliefs by doing so. So Reddit, I’m not really sure where I stand with this.

Nope, a few minutes later a woman came up to me with the slide blocker and started going off on me for talking to her child. I told her what I said and that her daughter had been making smaller children cry by hissing at them and not letting them use the slides. 
She then asked me how I would feel if she talked to my child. I said if the situation were reversed I would make him apologize for being mean and have him take a time out until he could remember how to be nice. 

That made her angrier and she continued to berate me a little longer and eventually asked me if I wanted to meet her in the parking lot (yes, she was an adult, probably around 40yrs). That made me angry so I told her I was done with the conversation and to have a nice day. My tone probably came out more like ""go to hell"" than ""have a nice day"". Then I put my earbuds back in and ignored her. She continued to complain loudly with her kid until we left about 10 minutes later.

1,"AITA for using the men’s restroom? | I’m a woman. As usual, the line for the women’s restroom was 8-10 women deep, but there was only one doorway leading to the both single person restrooms, one for each gender. As such, both men and women were standing in a single file line waiting to get in.

I’m next up, with one man and multiple women behind me. Well a guy walks out of the men’s restroom and the woman before me had JUST walked in, so I knew it’d be a minute before that one opened up. In the interest of keeping the line moving, I went into the men’s even though there was a man in line right behind me. I didn’t want to hold him up though (again, I just wanted to keep the line moving, and I *was* in front of him so I should get to go first), so I did my business quickly, and fwiw I was out before the woman who went into the other before me.

The guy looked a little disgruntled, but didn’t say anything. In my mind, if the bathrooms didn’t have gender markings then it would have made total sense for me to just go in to the next available one. But I ask if I’m TA because I now realize that while it’s not totally socially taboo for a woman to use the men’s restroom, it’d probably be seen as far less acceptable for a man to use the women’s, so he wouldn’t have been able to use the next available if the other lady had gotten out before me.

My fifteen year old son recently asked if he could order some games for his PS4. I was fine with it since he's ordered stuff from my account before and I didn't really mind. 

I hand off the card after he's told me how much it should cost and I let him go through with it. I don't really check my account when he's using it because I trust him and the notification about the amount of withdrawal from my bank seems right so I forget about it pretty much.

This was around a month ago as packages take around 3-4 weeks to ship to our country.

Three days ago his package finally arrived. As I'm getting it along with the rest of the mail he shows up and tries to take it immediately. I feel that something is wrong because he's never acted that way about a package, especially just another couple games.

He just gets more jittery about it when I ask questions so I ask him to unpack it in front of me. It's a bong. He ordered a glass bong online from my account with my money and lied to me about it.

He tries to lie about it being a misdelivered package and insists he bought games. He's always buying games and never buys anything else, why would he get a bong? I ask him not to lie to me and he continues to insist on it.

So I check the account and show him the purchase order. Then he starts shouting at me about it not being any of my business and tries to take it.

I tell him that I'm disappointed in him and break it into pieces and throw it away. I take away his PS4 and his laptop and tell him that he's not buying anything again and is grounded for lying and being disrespectful. I told him that he won't be getting any allowance until the price for it is paid off since I didn't agree to purchasing a bong. I also told him about the risks to a still growing child's health but he was too angry to listen. 

He has spent his time since sulking in his room and threatened to stop studying for his exams which are a month away. I told him that it's his future he would be ruining so he can if he likes.

I have since had time to reflect on this and I still feel very angry at him. Yet I do not wish to be too harsh on my son.

I have never grounded him before. It seems harsher now when he has no other distractions because of the current situation.

However, I feel incredibly sad that he has deceived me like this. I have always trusted my son to be truthful to me and have never punished him for anything if he has spoken the truth. He insisted that he would never lie to me as he continued to lie to my face. I do not trust him anymore.

I have had this talk with him yet he only gets angry when I speak with him at all after this and insists that what I did was wrong since it was his. I told him it was mine considering that he did not pay for it and cannot do so legally.

AITA for my actions in this instance? Am I being too harsh?",False,False
0,"WIBTA for getting a girl with a fake service dog kicked out of my school | (Sorry for poor english ESL)
For the past few months a girl in my school has brought her dog into the school with a service dog vest fake ids.
At first it didnt mind as i also have a service dog and it was a cool thing to see someone else have one until she let people pet the dog that is. (Thats not the only thing that she has done) When i would pass her though and see people petting the dog i would get mad but i would try to tell her that her dog has a job and people shouldnt be able to pet it. She became defensive and started yelling at me that it is her dog and people can pet it. Later that week the dog would come up to me and smell me and jump up on me. The dog is a small dog so i didnt notice until it barked and i would tell her to control her dog she would again get mad and yell at me. Recently her dog has been using the bathroom in the hall ways and the school said they couldnt do anything without proof that the dog is fake.
So i asked my brother in law who trains service animals if her vest and badge was real. He said they weren't and sent me photos of real vests and badges and the website she bought them from along with proof that the website wasnt a real service dog website. I have all the proof that her service dog is fake and i told her this and she told me to f off i have nothing to prove. So would i be the asshole if i gave the school deans all of my proof and got her service dog kicked out.",False,False
0,"AITA for assuming my coworker was offering me free tickets, not a date? | I (F22) work/volunteer was offered “free” zoo tickets by someone I work/volunteer with,I’ll call him Dave (M36). 
Dave is much older than me, and up until very recently had been in a relationship. 

He works for the city, and apparently gets free zoo tickets every year around Christmas time. 
He told me that he doesn’t really have any use for the tickets as he’s single and childfree. 
Now, he’s been a little flirty with me before, but seemed to calm down when I told him that I’m 1) married and 2) not interested. 

I’m the only one in the volunteer group with a child. He asked me if I wanted to go for free with my daughter(2 years old), so I said yes to the tickets. 
It’s very important to note that he ONLY ever mentioned me and my daughter going, he even said that he couldn’t get enough tickets for my husband to go too. 

A few days ago he started texting me about how “we” were going to have such a great time and he got the tickets for next week. I said “we?” He replied “yeah, me you and (daughter’s name)” 

I haven’t replied, because this whole thing seems WEIRD.  

He did something similar earlier in the year too, he invited me to dinner and strongly implied that other people would be there too, it ended up being a very awkward dinner with just the two of us.

0,"AITA for turning away my half brother? | This happened around New Years but recent events had made me think about it.

I don't remember my father, everything I know is from eavesdropping on my older brother and sister. He refused to marry my mother because of tax reasons or so he claimed but one day just left her to raise four kids (technically he only knew about three because my mom didn't know about my little brother until afterwards).

Fast forward Christmas/New Years of 2019 I get a Facebook message from someone claiming to be my half brother, he admits he didn't even know we existed until he went through his father's things (he had recently died) and found some old pictures of us as kids and a half full journal.

He had been cheating on my mother since sometime after my older sister was born, and even had a child with the woman around the same time I was born (I'm older by a month), his mistress finally wised up and gave him an ultimatum, her or us... he chose to leave behind three (soon to be four) kids and a woman who despite being abused her whole childhood to the point she looks like a druggie (little to no teeth, terrible skin, etc.) Was the most caring and hardworking person you could meet, for someone prettier and younger with only one mouth to feed. And the killer thing was? They got married within the year.

Karma is of course a bitch and they got divorced within a few years and she left him with their son as she presided to jump off the face of the earth.

Now I don't hate my half brother, it's not his fault our father made like Zeus and thought with his dick instead of his brain, but I did tell him that while I didn't mind being Facebook friends it wouldn't be a good idea reaching out to everyone else especially my mom. She hates everything about my father; his name, the kind of car he owned (Chevrolet Camino, if anyone owns that car especially an older model in orange, just know there's a fifty year old woman who wants to destroy it), the only exception are her kids because in her mind we're her babies not his.

My older brother and sister wouldn't be any better because unlike me who was too young to remember, they do, and they still hope that he burns in hell, because when he left we all had to move in with our emotionally abusive grandmother.

1,"AITA for refusing to pay for my roommates’ pizza? | This just happened, and I’m not sure how to handle it. 

I rent out a house with two other girls. They were friends prior to us all living together ( I work with one of the girls). 

They went out with two other friends in the evening. They called me and told me that they were stuck in traffic on the other side of the city. They wanted to order a pizza ( which can take two hours on Friday nights ) and they wanted me to answer the door. They said I could have some because it was an extra large pizza.

The pizza got there pretty quickly (45 minutes). I had a few pieces. Then a few more. Before I knew it I had just mindlessly eaten a good portion of the pizza. I felt really bad. And left cash on the bar to pay for what I had done. 

When my roommate walked in with other roommate and her fiends she started yelling and throwing a fit asking what happened to the pizza. I told her I was sorry, and that I left money on the bar. She said “what the hell are we supposed to do now Mama June?” All of her friends started laughing and other roommate threw in some snide remarks too. 

I started crying walked over to the bar, took my money back, and went to my room. I feel extremely insulted and embarrassed by what they did. They and their friends continued to talk badly about me, calling me bad names, calling me inconsiderate, making fun of my appearance. They all went out around half an hour ago. 

My roommate has sent me several Venmo requests asking me to pay for the pizza. I sent her a text saying that she lost the right to the money when she humiliated me I front of her friends.

In February, she got a really bad case of influenza, and it took her about a month to recover. She spent some time in the hospital, and she ended up losing more then 20 pounds. 

I went to visit my family in March (I’m in college) and I complemented her weight loss. She told me it was related to the flu; and I told her to keep up the momentum. I also told her that maybe her illness was a blessing in this guise, because it caused her to lose weight.

Some facts about me (that my mother knows and acknowledges to various degrees) :

* 32 years old, only child
* a lesbian but not exactly interested in having a relationship with anyone
* have been vocally childfree/child-negative since I was about 14 years old
* vocally pro-choice and openly say I would get an abortion if I ever got pregnant for any reason, even though they are illegal in our country

* me finding a man and getting pregnant asap
* me possibly having 'an accident' that ends in pregnancy (I'm *pretty* sure she means an 'oops baby'...)
* my clock ticking

I didn't think this was a problem until recently I drove with my uncle in the passenger seat and he told me to speed up- I was on the road to Starbucks going 40 mph. I asked him why, I was going the speed limit, and he told me that it would be annoying  to other drivers to have to get around me. 

I maybe sped up to 45, but I felt really uncomfortable and slowed back down to 40. I use my turn signals, check mirrors and side window before changing lanes, and do everything I'm supposed to do, but I'm also terrified of having an accident.

1,"AITA for making fun of how my coworker dresses | I know, the title makes me sound like a major a-hole, but I couldn't think of a better way to say it. 

For context, I (26f) work for a moderately sized software startup, so our office culture and attire is pretty casual. I grew up kind of poor, and my mom raised us with the mindset of ""we can't afford to be cheap"" ie, if you're only going to buy one pair of shoes all year, those shoes better last. As an adult that's definitely translated into a quality over quantity mindset, so my wardrobe is mostly well made, but pretty minimalist (and I think stylish tbh) staples. 

There's a woman in my office (late 30's) who mostly wears clothing from hot topic, lots of nightmare before Christmas stuff, tights with cats/other large patterns, lacy and corset like items. She's made some remarks in the past about how she often sees me in the same few outfits, or how I often repeat things. Usually I just ignore them or brush them off but I have to be honest I was already in a salty mood when I ran into her in our kitchen. 

I was wearing an outfit I wear fairly regularly (oversize white button down, black jeans, black boots)

Me: Hi (coworker)

Her: Hi OP

Me:\*begins making my cup of tea\*

Her: Wearing the same thing again, have you thought about mixing it up?

Her: Continues to talk about how I should really add some color and pattern to my wardrobe, and how my clothes right now are so boring. 

Me:(probably being an asshole) Well some of us just prefer dressing like adults.

1,"AITA for telling my step aunt that her “parents” are not her real parents? | My mom married my stepdad when I was 5. We would visit his parents every five years or so. My step grandmother had 4 children with her first husband.

When she got remarried, my stepdad and his brother were both in their late teens so they remember this situation very well. Since I wasn’t there, I will tell you the story from their POV.

When my stepdad was about 17, his little sister who was 15 at the time, got pregnant. My stepdad clearly remembers her being pregnant. Very early into the pregnancy, my stepdads sister was “sent away” and about 7 months later, she reappeared and magically my step grandmother had a newborn baby with her new husband. From the moment that happened, obviously everyone knew that my step aunt had had a baby and given it to my step grandparents. But no one ever wanted to rock the boat and confront them. Also, years later my aunt who had the baby wrote a letter to her other brother detailing what had happened and how sad she was about it. So there is no doubt that she gave the baby to my step grandparents.

That child became what I knew to be my step aunt who was only about 7 years older than me. In reality, she was my step cousin. I along with my siblings, cousins, everyone from that side of the family, grew up knowing the truth. Except for her. 

Fast forward to 2008. I moved to NYC. My step aunt happened to also move to NYC a year or so after me. We had never been super close due to the geographic distance between our families but my parents encouraged me to text her and hang out due to being in the same city and also being so close in age. We instantly bonded. We had the same interest, the same sense of humor and rapidly became very good friends. Friends more than family. We hung out with each other weekly for the next 6 years. All along, I knew this deep, dark, horrible secret but I could never bring myself to tell her because I didn’t know what it would do to her.

In 2015, I left NYC and moved to Florida where she had grown up and where my step grandparents resided. We also were not super close but due to my extremely close friendship with my step aunt, they started inviting me over frequently. 

In January of this year, I was talking with my step aunt on the phone. We stayed close even though I had moved away and would text or chat often. I finally decided that I had had enough of the lies and that if no one else in the family was going to tell her what we all knew, that I was going to do it, because she was my friend. My parents and close family from that side all supported what I had done and even spoke to my step aunt to back up what I had told her with more detail. 

My step aunt on the other hand was enraged. She called me a liar and told me that what I did was beyond hurtful. My step grandfather also called me a liar and asked why I wanted to hurt the family so much.

Needless to say, I haven’t heard from my aunt or her parents since this happened. And I keep asking myself if I did the right thing.

1,"AITA for revealing to a prospective employer of my former employee that he shares pay information with coworkers, possibly costing him a job? | To preface this, I run a small business with fewer than 20 employees. I have a former employee who we will call Adam. He left on good terms, but it came to my attention months after his departure that either during or after his employment term, he had told coworkers his payrate, asked for and acquired theirs, and openly shared this set of information with multiple people at the company. This has caused a number of ongoing problems, productivity and jealousy related, amongst staff.

I understand under federal law it is illegal to terminate someone for discussing pay with coworkers, and I want to emphasize that he was not terminated at all but rather resigned his position after finding another job. 

I was recently contacted by another employer seeking a reference on Adam. I was truthful, said the good, the bad, and also disclosed the behavior noted above. Several weeks later, Adam emailed me asking if someone from XYZ company had called for a reference on him, and If so, what I had said, since he thought the job interview went well yet he wasn't given an offer. I was honest with him, told him that I found out what he had been doing, thought it was noteworthy due to the problems it caused and therefore felt obliged to mention it. Whether the prospective employer felt that this type of behavior was acceptable was fully up to them. Adam then became angry and threatened a lawsuit against me for retaliating against him for doing something that was fully legal. I have not yet responded to the threat. I believe he was just venting and has no actual intention of filing a lawsuit. 

The way I see it is, at the end of the day all I did was relay the facts. Adam was the one to engage in the questionable behavior, and XYZ company was the one to turn him down for the job based on this behavior. So am I the asshole here?",False,False

I'm not saying that to gloat about the fact I got in but because it explains why going there is a much bigger deal than any other uni. It might also be important to mention that our dad's are brothers and do not get on very well and our grandparents are closer to my dad.

We both applied. She got rejected. I got in. The next week, we were at our grandparents and she seemed visibly upset with me. I let this slide, the uni had been her dream for far longer than it had been mine. Throughout the day, her and her parents kept rolling their eyes whenever my acceptance got mentioned. Eventually over dinner, my grandfather gave a toast to my acceptance to the uni AND her acceptance to her second choice uni. 

At this point, she ran out crying and I followed her because even though we're not close I wanted to see if she's okay. She said it was unfair I got accepted because I don't work as hard as her and that she's wasted years of her life on getting into this uni and it's been ruined by people like me.

This took me by surprise. I'll admit I do juul, drink, and smoke weed recreationally but I still work exceptionally hard. Both academically and recreationally.

I had a baby with a man that I was briefly dating. He didn’t want to be a father at the time, and wanted to give up his parental rights. I let him. He hasn’t seen her at all since she was born. 

Baby is now six years old. She has asked about her father. I told her that her father passed away and was in heaven. Ive shown her a pictures of her father so that she knows what he looks like. She has come to peace with the circumstances. 

Here’s my reasoning: better her think that he’s dead than that she was unworthy of his care and attention. 

What I was not expecting was for Dad to want to re-enter the picture. He he had another child, and feels regret about not seeing or knowing our daughter. I explained to him that I told her that he died. I don’t think it’s best that he see her right now. He is attempting to start paying child support and fight for reinstatement of parental rights. 

I currently live with my parents and my mother thinks that I should explain to my daughter that her father is alive, and let her see him. She never agreed with me telling her that he was dead. I disagree. I feel like it will damage the trust my daughter has in me, and it will spur thoughts in her head like: “why didn’t daddy care for me before?”

My father agrees with me. He doesn’t really like the father, and doesn’t think he should be around. He didn’t care before, and it will be tough explaining to a six year old why he cares now.

I am thinking that I wait until she is older and has a better ability to understand and process the situation. Then she can meet her father. He wants to meet now, but I would rather her carry on thinking that he’s not with us. Does that make me an asshole?",False,False

I will admit, I usually would have my door closed most of the time but when I get home from school I just want to relax.

This also means my 20yo brother comes wandering into my room touching my shit to annoy me and just stands there doing things to get on my nerves. Every time I get mad at him my mum says I can’t just be antisocial.

Mhm had been home for half an hour and I was speaking to her for a bit and then went to my room to lie down and closed my door.

My brother has suggested swapping presents, but neither of us really want to because most of my presents aren't his thing and I own 1 of the games already and wouldn't play the others. I gave him the couple of things I got he'd like because he didn't get anything else from our parents and honestly I don't play with my 3DS that much at the moment and he's not that rough with things I just know that if it gets damaged it will never ever get replaced. My laptop got broken in 2015 because my dad borrowed and dropped it then replaced it for my birthday when they should have just given me a new one because I wasn't careless with it, the laptop I had was still pretty new and I didn't get to pick the new one which wasn't one I really wanted or the same as the old one. He could sell the games but we don't have the receipt to return them. Also if I share something it becomes a family item and I can never get it back. Everyone including my brother thinks I should have brought it up later, but I think if I hadn't immediately made a fuss they would have acted like that was agreeing.  My parents agree that I should just lend him my 3ds, but I played with it last week. I feel like I was ambushed on purpose and they should have discussed it first. At the same time I have had a lot more free money than my brother has this year and I didn't share as much as I could have. I just think it's too big an item to demand I share.",False,False
0,"AITA for not telling the special needs kids school I wasn't volunteering? | Sorry if my English is bad, it's not my first language, I'm sick af and I'm on mobile.

Yesterday I told a friend of mine that story and he told me I was a bit asshole, and I kinda see where he gets that.

So, I was 14 at that time, and I wanted to work. Instead of working a shit teen job, my mom offered me to ""volunteer"" in a school for disabled kids (7-10 yo) and she will pay me. So I did, and ""worked"" there for 2 months.

At the last day of the summer vacation the staff threw a surprise goodbye party for me with the kids, and all the staff told me that they were amazed by the fact I was volunteering there while all the other teenagers were busy drinking. (I was the only minor there).
At that moment I didn't had the guts to tell them my mom was paying me, and all I did was saying thanks over and over again.
They even bought me a small souvenir.
I would have told them if the subject of payment was brought up before.

AITA for not telling them I was getting paid by my mom?

P.s:
My mom paid me more than I would have got a normal job for that age.

0,"AITA For refusing to sit next to a kid with autism during a lecture, and sitting on the floor instead? | I know this sounds bad but bare with me, I’m (23m) in a class that has exactly 30 seats, and there are 31 students. I was running late and walked in a minute before the lecture began. There was only one open seat. 

I walked over to it and in the next seat over sitting was a kid with autism, he is very socially inept but totally brilliant. The problem is that he smelled like he hadn’t showered in a few weeks, his hair was greasier than Snapes, and he was wearing stained pajamas. 

I sat next to him for 2 minutes before I was about to gag and I got up and sat on the floor in the back of the lecture hall. The professor saw this and asked if I moved because of the smell, he asked in front of the whole class, I said I just didn’t want to sit there and he continued lecturing. After class a few of the kids said I was TA because I should have just sucked it up for the hour and dealt with the smell.

0,"AITA for the way I've been handling my close friend having a crush on me? | Me and my friend (lets call him Ian) have been pretty close for the past two semesters at college. We talked almost everyday and hung out with mutual friends together all the time. A month ago Ian met my boyfriend for the first time, and the day after sent me a series of really weird texts, one of which insulted my boyfriend by comparing him to a really unattractive character in a movie. I asked him why he was acting so weird and he wouldn't tell me. 

Eventually a couple of mutual friends told me that Ian has had a big crush on me for awhile and that I was the only one in the dorm hall that didn't know. It's been a week and Ian and I haven't really spoken to each other because its been so awkward, but I've been hearing weird things that he's done or said. For example, last Wednesday he refused to talk to anyone and was only using sign language. I've also been told that he said ""Well MooseLand's boyfriend is a senior so they're not going to last long. I'm not giving up"".

Today he texted me and asked if I was upset because he insulted my boyfriend. I said ""I mean it definitely wasn’t cool, but I’m upset about other things as well"". He apologized for the lack of communication and then followed the apology up with ""on the flip side though, you probably could have done a better job communicating what was going on with (boyfriend)  months ago. I think you were a little naive/unrealistic about what was happening"". I explained to him that my boyfriend and I only started dating in January and that I told him about my boyfriend multiple times. I also said that I had zero idea that he was attracted to me. The final text he sent me was ""Oh wow. Literally everyone in (Dorm Hall) knew I had feelings for you, I assumed you did too. My bad. I guess I took things wayyy too slow. It’s too bad because we have damn good chemistry"".

0,"WIBTA if I stole my parents' insurance card and fled to a real doctor to get away from their naturopathic garbage? | I'm 18 and have a job. I currently work part time but have been thinking about going full time so I can get health benefits and afford my own insurance, plus school's out for the rest of the year. Unfortunately for now I'm on my parents' plan.

I've been begging my parents for months to get me a therapist and anger management classes but they don't think I need it, and instead try to get me to swallow their chamomile tea with lavender oil as an alternative. It doesn't work but they always say ""You don't know that, and what's wrong with it being placebo if it works?"" I can't argue with their oils and sugar pills.

Recently before shit went down in the world they took me to this ""naturopath"" who took a blood sample with this US Biotek thing, to identify food antibody reactions and to put me on an elimination diet. It said I was allergic to pineapple, corn, wheat, dairy, and soy amongst other stuff, but I've been eating this shit for years and I'm still alive. So grass fed beef and gluten free stuff was just a waste of money.

And from this same naturopath they've spent about $600 worth of products from a company called Nature's Sunshine. I used to take the supplements but then I found out it's a pyramid scheme so I stopped taking them. And found out the US Biotek thing is on naturopath sites and one of the founders practices something called ""functional medicine"". I looked it up and one of the first words on Wikipedia is ""controversial"". Ahahaha bruh.

They're getting on me for not taking my supplements and they think that someone needs to have a license to sell Nature's Sunshine, and it's been around for many years so it must be legit. Bitch no it isn't. They also believe the conspiracies that modern medicine only serves to profit off of products that kill people. But doesn't alternative medicine do the same?

1,"AITA for playing a revenge prank on my brother and his girlfriend on Valentines day? (I snuck a ""how to buy diamonds"" book for her to find in our apartment). | For some background, I live with my brother while he's getting his feet under him and I'm getting my masters degree. He is 27, I am 22. He has been dating this girl ""Liz"" for about 6 years and she is about to come unglued waiting for him to propose and he claims that he's just not ready yet. 

About 4 months ago, my brother found my Tinder account and he and his friends basically catfished the shit out of me using pics they stole from Instagram. I was an idiot and I fell for it, hook line and sinker. I wanted to get revenge on him some how but wasn't sure. 

The week before Valentines day I was in B&N and saw this book ""How to Buy Diamonds"" on one of the endcaps. I saw my chance so I bought the book. On Valentines morning I stole my brothers phone, turned it off and watched him stomp around the house which in reality was a pretty good prank. He went to work without his phone and since I was home all day, I ""hid"" the book in the stack of crap my brother keeps on the coffee table and at like 4 I texted Liz and said basically ""Bro lost his phone, he wanted me to text you to come over now if able so he can take you out."" She texted me back and showed up maybe an hour later. 

I made sure the binding of the book was plainly visible and let her in. I said I had to study in my room and closed the door. I could hear her flipping through a magazine and then about died laughing when she called her sister or friend and said something like ""he has a how to buy a diamond book! Oh my god. Do you think it's tonight? Oh my god! It has to be tonight. It has to be! I call you back as soon as it happens!"" I literally couldn't contain myself I was laughing so hard. 

So bro got home, they went on their date. Maybe 2 hours later they came back through the door screaming bloody murder at each other. Obviously he hadn't proposed and she was screaming at him why did he have a ""how to buy diamonds"" book if he wasn't going to propose. He was trying to talk his way around it all because she was furious with him. Finally she dug the book out of the stack of stuff and threw it at the wall. My brother obviously knew it was me at that point but Liz didn't care and said she needed a ""break"" to figure out if the relationship is really for her after 6 years. As far as I know she hasn't spoken to him in two weeks. 

For my brothers part, he understands that I was just getting back at him and he admits it was a pretty good joke but he is truly, truly broken hearted over Liz possibly breaking up with him over it. I feel really bad but at the same time I didn't make her freak out.

0,"AITA For never helping to take care of my roommates dog? | Yeah I know right? How can you not pet a dog and so forth?

Well let me give you some backstory here. A month or four ago I was in the market for a new roommate and given the place I live is rather popular, it did not take long before I found multiple people. After some picking and choosing I eventually ended up agreeing to let this guy we'll call John(Fake name) be my roommate.

Now all went well between John and me, we were certainly not best friends as we were too different for that. But regardless of this we got along just fine, he pays on time and he discusses important crap impacting both of us before doing it which is important if you ever had roommates. That is until he decided to get a dog, without a warning, asking me or even informing me, suddenly I enter my house and I am greeted by the high pitched barks of a tiny dog and a smiling John playing with said dog.

So obviously I ask him why there is a dog in the living room and John informs me he bought a dog and so forth, well as you might imagine shit blew up at that point, this is something you discuss not something you just do. But to make a long story short I felt bad about making him take the dog back so I told him, he could keep it if he agreed to some basic rules. 1: I don't want the dog sitting on my furniture.(I own 90% of the furniture) 2: If he breaks or ruins anything you will replace it, not cover it up, not try to fix it, Replace it. 3: You will be the only person taking care of this dog, I will do absolutely nothing. 4: He is not allowed in my bedroom or attached Bathroom. 5: You do the vacuuming(Having had dogs most of my life until now, I know how much more vacuuming will have to be done with a dog around)

Well we are now 3 months later and John is not enjoying this new arrangement, he calls me to please feed his dog, I say no. He calls me to please walk his dog because he is working late, No Sir. The dog decided to rip a hole in my couch, well that was an expensive one, wasn't it John? Will you do the vacuuming just once? No John I won't. Hey can you look after my dog I really want to go out tonight? No John, No I can't. Now I can see this is impacting John, his social life has gone to crap and frankly I could easily help him out if I wanted to, but I just won't. So am I the asshole here?",False,False
1,"AITA for expecting the girl I'm dating to offer help cleaning after I cook dinner. | We're both mid 30s, less than 6 months post divorce, and have been dating for 6 weeks. We see each other 2-3x per week and usually alternate whose house we go to. When we go to her house, we typically go out for food since she's in the process of moving so she's never cooked for me before. I've made dinner for her 4x at my place, not huge productions but I am a damn good cook so I don't mind cooking for other people.

The issue came about after dinner, she had not offered to help me clean up after we finish eating. I didn't say anything the first 3x, just chalked it up to her having a good time or wanting to play with my border collie. The 4x after I was done cleaning, I was severely annoyed that she had yet offered to help clean up after I had cooked really delicious meals for her four times. She's a really kind person, and I would never have thought she was doing this maliciously or to use me, but when I put myself in her shoes I was astonished how she thought watching me cook and then clean without offering help was ok.

A little background, I'm was raised in NC and she was raised in MN. So when I confronted her I asked if it's considered rude in MN to not offer help cleaning up after someone cooks for you. She said it's not, and that when she cooks for someone, she doesn't want anyone in the kitchen at all. Additionally, she said it shouldn't be an expectation for the guest to offer help, and if I wanted help I should have asked for it. I did view it as an expectation that the person offers to help. We discussed it for 5 minutes, chalked it up to cultural differences, and it's now water under the bridge. I came off a bit harsh during the exchange, and she let me know the next day when we both essentially apologized to each other, but now we both need to know who the Asshole really was?",False,False

0,"AITA for refusing to split the money with my roommates? | I live in one of the few big Australian cities with 4 room mates. As you can imagine with 5 people living together there are quite a bit of empties. The next station to drop them off and get your 10 cents back is a 40 minute drive away so usually we just don't bother and throw them out with all the other garbage. 
Recently however, I realised what a waste of resources and money that is and decided that it would be worth to recycle them. 
So last week I asked all of my room mates if they wanted the empties and as expected they all said no. I then took them to the recycling station and got around $40 for them. The next day one of my roommates asked me what happened to the bottles so I told him and he must have told the rest because now they want me to split the money evenly between the 5 of us.

0,"AITA for assuming someone went to rehab for drugs? | So the other night I was at my SO’s work party and one of the guys brought his new girlfriend. It’s a really relaxed environment, we all just chilled at the office and ate dinner and drank a little bit. We all start breaking off into smaller groups having different conversations, and I start talking to 2 of the techs, one of whom is the one with the new girlfriend. A few minutes into the conversation the girlfriend walks up and I end up chatting with her and I ask her what she does for work.

She tells me she is a real estate agent but that she’s been out of work for a little while because she was in rehab. 

I was kind of taken aback that she was so open about something like that with people she just met but hey, some people are just like that. Good for her for getting clean, I’m sure I’d be proud of that too. That’s pretty much my entire thought process on this. My whole family has dealt with addiction and my mother even passed away a few years ago from an OD, so I’m no stranger to the demon that is drug addiction, nor am I someone who would pass judgement. 

I say to her “oh wow, it’s amazing that you completed the program. I’m so happy for you! How long have you been clean now?” I’d never usually ask such personal questions but I figured that she brought it up so she wouldn’t mind me asking.

She got this horrified look on her face and basically shrieked “WHAT? I meant *physical rehabilitation* not DRUG rehab!! What kind of person do you think I am??” 

I stuttered out a fast apology for the misunderstanding but she wouldn’t hear it and literally just turned and walked away from me. The rest of the night was super uncomfortable and she kept whispering to her boyfriend angrily and shooting me dirty looks the entire night. 

My SO got an angry text from coworker later that night saying how I offended his gf by assuming she was, and I quote, “a filthy drug addict” and that I owe her an apology. (I got really upset at that text because they acted like drug addicts are only homeless street rats when *plenty* of addicts live high functioning lives.)

My SO tried to explain my thinking, saying how I thought she meant drug rehab and not physical rehab and that it was an innocent mistake, but the coworker says that obviously someone I just met wouldn’t offhandedly mention they just got out of (drug) rehab and that my assumption was idiotic and offensive.

0,"AITA for not helping the women with dishes? | My in-laws have large family holidays (40+ people). The first time I met his family, I noticed there were no women! At mealtime, the women suddenly appeared. After dinner, the guys migrated to watch the football game, and the women disappeared again. I thought they just didn't like football. It turns out that the women spend 2 hours before the meal cooking, folding napkins, setting tables, etc. Then after the meal, the women spend another hour or two doing dishes and cleaning. By the time they were done cleaning, everyone was preparing to leave.

The next holiday, aunt-in-law mentioned that the women would like to meet me, since we barely interacted. They'd love if I could come an hour early and help set up. I shook off the vague Stepford Wives vibes and I figured, when in Rome, do as the Romans do.

So my then-boyfriend and I showed up early. The women looked at me like I had grown a third eye. Aunt declared ""No men in the kitchen!"", he was banished to the TV room, and suddenly I was stranded with 20 people I didn't know. Most of these women are housewives, and it is a matter of pride that they do 100% of the housework and cooking. It quickly became clear that I am inept at floral arrangement and my knife work is not up to par (I know how to cook, but I really don't care if the carrots slices are uneven). One of the women told me not to worry because they will teach me to be ""bride ready"" so I can make my husband proud. Awkward.

After the meal, the women started collecting dishes, and I mentioned to my then-boyfriend that we should both help out. But, he was again banished. So I retreated with him to the TV room and hung out with the guys. We played a board game while the women cleaned.

That was a few years ago, and since then, I stay with the guys during family holidays. I'm the only woman who does. Occasionally one of the women will hand me a stack of dirty plates, or ask for help with prep. I'll help out, but I usually pull my husband in to help, too. When he gets banished, I'll go too.

We go to family gatherings 3-4 times a year. 10 hours/year of housework will not kill me. Still, it feels really weird and archaic that the men lounge around while the women work. Also, the women kind of freak me out. They are 100% perfect housewives and can be pretty intense. Never a hair out of place. I'm a nerdy tomboy, and I'm way more comfortable with the guys.

My mom says I'm being rude. If I don't want to participate with the way they run their family functions, I should not attend. By hanging out with the guys, I'm basically rejecting all of the women and their way of life.

For reference, my sister went to art school back in our home state. The rest of our family moved to another state when she was a sophomore, but she was already living in dorms and stayed to finish school.  She's always been on the shittier side when it comes to mental health, ie eating disorders, depression, stuff like that,  but AFAIK she's been taking medication for it. She graduated in May (with no job offers, of course) and moved back in with us. She got a retail job nearby and keeps trying to work on stuff for her portfolio, but lately she's been ""to depressed to feel inspired"" and just keeps giving up after a few hours of drawing. She's an okay artist, but it's not like I can't find anything better if I scroll through twitter for a bit.

I figured maybe it's just been because of graduation, but it's been two months and she's still acting moody. She doesn't have any friends, practically has a panic attack over every little thing, and can barely make any portfolio work because of all her anxiety. She's 23 freaking years old, and I think it's kind of pathetic that she's still acting like this. Our mom is paying for her to go to therapy every week and tells her to focus on ""getting better"", but I think babying her so much is just stupid.

For context, my house went on fire when I was 10 and I was lucky to survive. It was obviously traumatising and after a long time of hating my body, I became an alcoholic in my teens to cope. When I was 20, I went drunk driving, crashed my car and my right leg was amputated from the knee and I’ve worn a prosthetic leg ever since.

Since it’s March, the weather is warmer now and I had to go out to get some standard shopping so I on instinct wore a jumper and shorts with it as it’s not cold out. On full display was my prosthetic and my badly scarred left leg. I should  also note I received a skin graft on that leg, so some of the skin is more visible and scarred than other portions.

Anyway, I decided to take a little walk before going to the store and I cut through a park. There isn’t much people around but there’s a few out. I got a couple of stares but that’s normal and I got to the store. I browsed for the stuff I needed like normal and when I got to checkout, there was a huge queue. I was expecting this so I was waiting and eventually, a mom and her son of about 3/4 went in line behind me. Nothing was said but I could feel the kid staring at me and he eventually started crying.

I then get a pat on my shoulder from the mom asking if I’d let them go in front of me so they wouldn’t have to stare at my “deformed leg” and my “robot one” as I was really upsetting her kid. I got really offended and told her that I wasn’t letting her skip and that some people happen to have visible deformities and that I’m allowed to wear shorts.

1,"AITA for wanting a buying a snake against my boyfriends wishes? | my boyfriend or my snake?

I’ve always wanted a pet snake since I can remember, I’ve just turned 23 and it’s just always been just a dream because my parents wouldn’t allow one. I’ve been with my boyfriend for over 5 years now and we’ve been living in our own 1 bedroom flat for 2 years. He’s not a big fan of snakes but has promised me when we have bought somewhere bigger (at least 2 bedrooms) I can get a snake and keep it somewhere where he won’t see it.

Recently we went to Brighton and ended up visiting an RSPCA reptile reserve on the way home, I fell in love with a snake there and I felt as though my dream could become a reality. I told him a few days later I wanted to return and get rescue it. He put up a fight about the mice being in the flat (he has a real phobia of rodents) and the smell and the fact that there’s no space for it... However I came back with arguments for all of those points; I would buy the frozen mice when it needs feeding (7-10 days) and feed it when he’s out, it doesn’t smell (he admitted to this eventually) and I measured out a space by our dining table where it would fit. Still he wasn’t happy and said no.

I went ahead a got it.

1 week since we visited I bought the snake back and set it all up, it’s perfect and I’m in love with it. He came home from work and couldn’t believe it. Now after 24 hours he says he will leave me if I choose to keep it. He says I can find somewhere to store the vivarium (cage) to use for when we have a house, return the snake to the RSPCA or he’s leaving me. I love him but I have created such a bond with this snake, of course I couldn’t end our relationship because of this, but I want to convince him to keep it! My argument is if you would be happy with it in a spare bedroom where you occasionally might see it can’t you get over it now? He says even at night in bed he fears it in the next room, wouldn’t it be the same when we get a house? And god knows how long that will be, I can’t wait! I don’t want to give up this snake that I feel as though I’ve already bonded with.

Then she said, “Actually I’m homeless and was wondering if you would get me a little cake.” 
I became super uncomfortable in that moment. 

Living in London, I’m used to being near homeless people. When they go car to car in the tube asking for money, I usually give them some because they’re always polite and it’s a gamble to spend money to ride the tube in hopes of getting more. 

But I was so uncomfortable with being approached by the girl in the middle of ordering my food and being asked if I could get her some as well. I felt like I was specifically targeted and trapped. (I get targeted for various reasons in the city regularly because I go places alone, I look much younger than my actual age, and I’m quite short and thin.) 

I ended up telling the cake lady maybe I’d come back another time and walking away from the situation. Obviously I wouldn’t tell the homeless girl I couldn’t buy her a cake and then turn to proceed to buy myself one, but I was completely turned off by how rude she was in her approach.  

Am I the asshole for not just buying her a cake??",False,False
0,"AITA for not letting my brother stay at my house on Valentine’s Day? | So my brother (33m) is in town visiting and his flight to go back home is early tomorrow, about 4:30 in the morning. He’s staying at my parents house. 

My husband and I picked him up from the airport last weekend at about 9 pm. I was sick and my husband worked all day, but my parents asked us to pick him up for them because my dad has trouble seeing at night. (He does have glasses but ya know, age). So we did them that favor.

It was established last week that my parents were going to pay for his Uber to the airport for his returning flight since it was so early in the morning and it would still be dark out. They live about 30 minutes from the airport.

My husband and I live about 15 minutes from the airport. Last night my mom called me and asked if they could drop my brother at our house on Friday (tonight) so he could Uber to the airport in the morning from us to save money. My mom told me it would be 75 dollars for him to get to the airport from their house. For the record, my husband checked himself and it would actually cost 35 dollars so I’m not sure where my mom got that number. 

If it were any other day it wouldn’t be a problem, but today is Valentine’s Day and my husband and I have plans. He’s cooking a nice dinner at home, I’m making dessert, and ya know-romantic husband and wife time. My brother sleeping over would kind of change the date night mood...

So I apologized but I told her that we had plans. We have other siblings who live in the area and I asked her if any of them could help out. And she acted a little short with me and told me that she and my dad would just take him. 

I feel a little guilty but I’m not going to let that change my mind because things have been hectic lately and my husband and I need the alone time. I also feel bad because I’m just getting over being sick, and we’ve both had work all week so we really didn’t get the opportunity to spend time with my brother. We see him about once a year, he lives states away. My husband says I shouldn’t feel bad but I can’t help it. So reddit, AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for accidentally interrupting a wedding procession on a boardwalk? | So yesterday I was walking up and down a public boardwalk playing Pokémon Go since it was Community Day. At one point I noticed there was a wedding congregation off to the side of the boardwalk in some grass since the boardwalk is very scenic in places being right next to the ocean.

The boardwalk runs east to west, so the wedding congregation was to the south of the boardwalk. I was walking by the congregation on the boardwalk looking at my phone catching Pokémon when suddenly some of the guests and venue staff (I guess they work for one of the buildings nearby) started yelling at me to get out of the way.

Initially I was extremely confused because I didn’t see anything to get out of the way of, so I gave the staff member a confused look and he pointed at something, which turned out to be the bride waiting off to the other side of the boardwalk (the north side to keep the geography consistent).

Now in my opinion there is no way I could have seen the bride off to the side unless I physically turned around because she was sort of hidden behind some plants. While I continued to walk I asked the staff member “where should I be walking?” and their response was again “get out of the way”. Again I asked “where should I walk?” and got the same response. 

At this point I decided the best way to get out of the way was just to continue walking until I was past the wedding but I was still getting shot dirty looks by the guests. 

So AITA here? I felt like a jackass for walking through but at the same time is it reasonable for them to block the whole boardwalk when it’s a public place and not give people an alternate route to walk around?",False,False
1,"WIBTA for leaving my girlfriend for getting an abortion? | M27 F28, both graduated and have stable jobs. Been together 7 years.

So, long story short, I am pro-life. 

When we learned that she was pregnant(around two weeks ago), I immediately resolved to be there for her and support her through every stage of the pregnancy. 

Then, two weeks later, she tells me she wants an abortion, because she doesn't want the responsibility of having a child in her life just yet.

As it goes against my beliefs, I don't want her to have an abortion. But, I want to respect my girlfriend's right to choose. 

I want to propose an ultimatum. The abortion or me. I am willing and wanting to sacrifice everything for this child, but if she isn't willing, then I don't want to impede her. 

I also don't want to be the dick that proposes an ultimatum.

1,"AITA for wanting my girlfriend to be less braggy about her work perks? She seems to forget that the way she lives isn't how most people live... | 
My girlfriend has a pretty sweet job. She doesn't have set hours; she just has to work 35 hours a week whenever is convenient for her and make it to her few meetings. She can work from the office or from home sometimes. She has a full benefits package despite being under what most people consider full time. A really nice retirement package too. And the company will pay everything for continued education.

She does work she finds interesting (cutting edge robotics) and gets along well with her coworkers. She has a lot of PTO per year and her boss even lets the employees ""earn up"" more; if they work extra hours one week they can ask for the equivalent in PTO for later.

Her team's managers buy them whatever they want for the office; they want a 500 dollar expresso maker, they get it. They want a type of fancy coffee, they get it. Nice furniture, done... 

They get paid well too; pretty middle of the road salary for robotics but she says the work life balance more than makes up for it. She'd rather have more time than be a top earner. And honestly a midrange robotics salary is still damn good.

And anyway, For a while I thought ""good for her"" for having found something that she is happy with. 

But recently it's gotten frustrating because I think she forgets that this isn't how everyone lives. Like when we're out with my friends or just hanging out she'll talk about the nice stuff her managers bought for the office, about all the vacations she takes, about how she and her coworkers left the office in the middle of the day to see a movie then came back and just worked a little later. 

And yeah, it seems like she forgets that is no way a normal job.

So last night we were at a party and she mentioned how she was going to tour a few new apartments Monday morning and afternoon, and one of the people at the party was like ""don't you have work"" and she said ""yeah but I can set my own hours"" 

And that just rubbed me the wrong way and I said that she needed to stop going on and on about her work perks, it was obnoxious and came off braggy. She was like ""I was just explaining something"" and I said it wasn't just this, it was everything. Most people don't live the life she lives.""

She said that I was coming off jealous and that it was a bad look. That she was where she was because she didn't settle for less; she studied and worked her ass off, and didn't let herself get too settled anywhere she was unfulfilled. And that instead of complaining, maybe I should ask myself what I'm feeling jealous of and what I need to do to get it. 

I told her she was missing the point; she'll always be around people who don't have what she does, and she could be a little more modest about it.

She said I was the only one who seemed to have a problem with it, and stormed off...

My girlfriend [F25] plans on moving up there in a couple months as well and when she does we will be moving in together. But for now, I’m moving in to a place with some new guys.

She offered to help me move which surprised me because I didn’t expect her to, it’s a 6 hour drive each way. I was fine with that. However, she said that she would want to stay until Sunday. I told her I’d appreciate it if she left Friday or Saturday because I wanted a chance to spend my first weekend in the new place getting to hang out and know my roommates.

She was upset about that and said that I care about those relationships more than ours. That’s not true. But I really do value opportunities for friendships because I don’t have any friends where I currently live, which I think is in part because I spend so much time with my girlfriend.

1,"AITA for calling out my neighbors for failing to quiet their baby? | There's this young couple who had just moved in to the apartment across mine about a month ago. I normally just keep to myself because of work so I never really got to interact with them. I never even noticed they had a baby.

A week after they moved in, I heard a baby wailing in the wee hours of the night. Not just crying, but straight up screaming like it was in pain. Being a light sleeper, that woke me up instantly. I tried to be understanding and just chalked it up to the baby being sick or something. But then the same thing kept happening for the next few weeks and I've been losing so much sleep.

It all came to a head last night when I was desperate to get a good night sleep because I had a conference to attend early in the morning. Around 2 in the morning, like clockwork, the baby started screaming its guts out again, with the parents unable to pacify it.

Well I was taken aback. Our son has severe special needs and was at school. We don't have what you would call family support, and we don't have any real friends anymore (special needs is fun that way) so our time without having to ""extreme parent"" is seldom. So I said no. 


""Sorry boy, our lad is at school and we got some stuff to do. Really sorry though mate....etc.....""

0,"AITA For putting my foot down to my grandmother? | Bit of background: my grandmother and grandfather were together since my grandfathers death a few years ago, they had a very traditional relationship where my grandfather controlled all finances, big decisions etc, and my grandmother would do the cooking and cleaning (note: she has worked in the past and has helped when my grandfather had his own buisness).

Ever since my grandfather passed away, my grandmother has been very reliant on my mum and me (aunt/mum's sister isn't very nice and lives quite a distance away) which makes sense. Due to bereavement, her memory has gotten a bit worse but she's had medical tests and there's nothing permanent. She needs glasses and a hearing aid (but refuses to wear them). I love my grandmother but I am more protective of my mum. I can see that my grandmother constantly relying on my mum to do everything for her (besides bathe her) is taking a toll. My grandmother is competent but doesn't want to learn how to do anything my grandfather did for her. 

Now the event that leads me to ask AITA: recently, whenever my mum has given my grandmother a time to arrive, she is always an hour to two hours early. Even if these times are 9:00am, she will arrive at 7:30am. Even if she writes the time down, no matter how many times my mum or myself tell her a time, she is always early. This used to be just a bit annoying but now she has started barging in when my mum is with clients (mum is a mental health adviser) and doesn't understand why my mum won't give her attention/hang out with her. I put my foot down and said that it's getting too much and is getting in the way of my mums work. Grandmother's response is that we treat her horribly and she wants my mum to quit her job. I tell her ""you need to be on time, check your phone or watch for the time. 15 minutes early is fine but an hour isn't! My mum is working."" She asks ""what do you expect me to do?""

Then she repeats herself. And didn't think anything just didn't want to bother and said ""Uhh, no can do not going that direction today"" . I lied. I'm going home, normal route as always.

0,"AITA for giving my mother a time limit for her visit. | Hello all! So my sister (29F) and I (31M) live on the other side of the country from our parents (who are long divorced). My mother has struggled with a second divorce, several other dramatic relationships with boyfriends, depression, alcoholism, pill addition, and compulsive shopping (which has caused huge financial problems) for a few years now. She has come to visit us a few times (as she has been off work due to these issues for a while now (sick leave, short/long term disability, etc). The last time she came without a return ticket and ended up staying 6 weeks, during which time she snuck alcohol on several occasions and mixed it with sleeping pills causing my sister to have to call an ambulance - resulting in a trip to the psych ward.

Oh and my sister is pregnant and was during that fiasco. Huge stressor as you can imagine. Add in the fact that we paid for her flight out here (as she wanted to come visit) and back and while she was here she did some impulse shopping - which was very frustrating for obvious reasons. All of this has caused a fair bit of anger and resentment in my sister and me as well as our spouses.

So as I mentioned, my sister is pregnant and due any day now and my mother is planning her trip out to see the baby before she supposedly will return to work. My sister suggested that she come for 1 week, but she wants to come for 3. She didn’t take this seriously until I, as tactfully as I could, asserted it last night. As you can imagine she was extremely upset that we would place a time limit on her. I explained that we didn’t want her away from her treatment program and medical resources for too long as last time her hiding out here caused a lot of disruption. And that is true - it is a cause for concern for us. But the other part is we are still recovering mentally from what happened last time.

But she’s a mother and she wants to be with her kids and grandchild. And I should add she was a good mother while we were growing up - this stuff has slowly escalated over the last 5 years or so.

1,"AITA for wanting back the unused salsa at a party? | I was at a super bowl party tonight, and each person brought a few items. Someone brought some salsa, and I also happened to bring some salsa.

At the end of the party, there were a few jars left. I took one so I could return it (college student, every few bucks counts, plus it was surprisingly expensive). I put it down, turned around for a few seconds, and then it was gone. 

I saw this person with maybe 4 bags of chips in her hands, plus some stuff hidden under the table. To be fair, the host said to please take all the food because he didn't want any of it in his house.

So I go to her and asked her if she'd taken a jar of salsa. She said she had. I asked her if she had brought one, and she said no.

So I asked her if I could have it to return it, as it would save me some money. She told me no, that the other person who brought salsa had said it was his and gave it to her. After a bit of back and forth, I dropped it because we're already on rocky terms and I didn't want to make things worse. Plus it was only a few dollars at the end of the day. 

On one hand, the salsa didn't really belong to anyone. It sort of belonged to whoever brought it, and since the other guy didn't want it I thought I should get to return it. On the other hand, once we brought it to the party, we essentially ceded control of it.

1,"AITA - My daughter is replacing me with her half-sister | I have always had trouble with my eldest daughter, ""Alice"". She was a difficult child, and is now a difficult adult of 22. She has a son of 18 months, Theo, and another baby on the way, she says by the same man. I have my doubts. Alice works in a call centre, and says she's management. I also doubt this. Alice is also living with her half-sister from my late husband's first marriage, and she is pushing me away, allowing her half-sister to replace me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sarah, (half-sister), is much older than Alice. My husband was a bit older than me, and I am only a few years older than Sarah. I won't go into the details of my husband's first marriage, but it was not a happy one, and when he divorced his first wife, Sarah took it very hard, and still bears a grudge against me to this day, despite the fact that my husband's ex wife died many years ago.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Growing up, Alice and Sarah didn't have much contact. Sarah distanced herself from my husband, and refused to be a part of his life. She didn't even meet Alice until she was a teenager. Alice has always fancied herself a martyr, and I have always been her favourite target for this. She makes up elaborate stories about her childhood, designed to make me look like a bad person.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Alice left home at 18. I always offered her a place in the family home, but she always refused, rudely. I recently found out that she is now living with Sarah and Sarah's husband, and is acting like they are her parents! She won't let me see Theo, but she is always rubbing it in my face how well Theo and Sarah get on. She posted a picture to facebook of Sarah and Theo with the caption ""Theo and Yera (rhymes with Sarah)"", which is far too close to a ""granny"" nickname for me. Sarah is NOT Theo's grandmother. I am. It will confuse him, and that's not fair.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've tried speaking to Alice about it, but she is unreasonable. She just says that I wasn't much of a mother to her, and that Sarah is more supportive. She also threw it in my face that I don't get to see either of my eldest son's children, either. My son and I get along wonderfully, but the mothers of his children are odd, unpleasant girls, and won't let me have contact with my grandchildren unless I jump through their ridiculous hoops, which I refuse to do.

I told Sarah that she was being immature as always, and that her past problems with me don't entitle her to drive a wedge between me and my daughter. Sarah just ignored me, but Alice became even more dramatic, and started putting even more pictures of Theo and Sarah on social media, which hurt me terribly.

1,"AITA for wanting my GF to sleep less? | My gf usually has a fairly normal sleep schedule, that is until she is on her period. For average 3 sometimes 4 days a month she is always knocked the fuck out on her period. This upsets me because that’s less time we get to spend together. 

Normally she wakes up at 9 or 10am but on her period she wakes up at 12 and then takes another hour or two nap later in the day!!!I’ve tried telling her I’m upset please fix this it’s not ok I just want to spend time with her. She refused and said she’s always  tired when she’s on her period and besides she’s in a lot of pain so I should just let her sleep. I don’t like how she’s refusing to acknowledge my feelings. So the past few days I’ve been shaking her awake at 9 or 10 like normal days (she is on her period now) and discouraging her naps. Unfortunately this has not worked and instead of being able to spend time with her like I wanted she’s just angry at me now. She’s claiming I’m trying to “control” her but what else am I supposed to do? When I told her about my feelings that I didn’t want her sleeping she doesn’t wanna change for me even tho it would make me happier. AITA for wanting this?

Later, I come to find out that there are a number of fathers in that program, but no mothers. So at the rest of my interviews, I didn't talk about my kids with the professors. I have a few offers and am deciding between them. I mentioned to my husband that I hadn't told any of these places that I have children and he was pretty upset about it. He told me it's wrong to hide my children and that discussing them should have been my first priority in interviewing, and I should only want to be accepted to programs that support families.

I'm fortunate to be at university and have the financial support from my uni. I've made friends with a girl (20F), she was born into a very financially privileged background.

I was venting to her about how it feels as a working class guy, the struggles I've faced and how resentful I've felt sometimes. She then said she knew how I felt, I was confused so I asked her. She said ""As a woman, I know how it feels to face adversity and feel resentment"". 

Her response left a bad taste in my mouth, because my experiences as a working class person were nothing like hers. I don't doubt she hasn't faced anything, but I found her response to be rude and oblivious. I said to her ""You don't understand what I've been through. In fact, you are rather privileged.""

I met this girl around 4 years ago when she moved to new Zealand from America, while in new Zealand she met an amazing guy who had also moved from America. they got together and have found out they are having a baby. 

it's a boy and they have been discussing baby names, they settled on a very samoan name, nobody in there family is samoan and they have no ancestral ties to samoa. it's also very commonly used for samoan boys so I could easily see people assuming he is samoan just by his name. I also think it's not ok but that's my opinion. 

she posted on Facebook asking people what we thought of her baby name and I told her that I found it dumb that she is not samoan but picked a samoan name. I also told her that I find it incredibly unfair to force your kid to have a samoan name when he is not samoan. some people agreed with me.

0,"AITA for asking my girlfriend to not talk to me about her autism partners support group? | I'm in a long distance relationship for now. There's been some tension and my girlfriend has been thinking I'm on the spectrum for awhile. I've never been diagnosed with autism. At one point she contacted my mother and brother without telling me to ask them about if I showed signs of it growing up. She wants me to get formally tested but upon looking into that's very difficult and expensive for an adult.

She joined a Facebook group for women with autistic boyfriends or husbands. The group seems to not act as a support group even if that's what it is in theory, but rather a place for women to vent about their autistic partners, or often just ex-partners of them venting about how awful they are. A lot of stuff she's shown me from it seems pretty bigoted, talking about how autistic people are basically sociopaths, how they can never understand emotions and never avoid from hurting people. She regularly shows me posts on it that ""remind her of me"" and sends me screenshots, often with her often hurtful comments about me intact. She asked on it if they thought I was on the spectrum and then showed me the responses. Her post was very one-sided in the description. The comments were very hurtful, most telling her to leave me, and about how I was obviously autistic and would never change. I told her how this hurts me and she just says that I need to address this even if it hurts because it could kill the relationship otherwise.

Whenever we discuss it we mostly go in circles. I pledge to change behaviors she dislikes and she shares stories from it as ""proof"" I might not be able to change and says it's important to talk about it because I need to be prepared if she decides to just walk away from the relationship as a result. I've actually gotten some books and resources to read about the issues with the relationship but sometimes don't get time to read them because we have a long drawn out conversation about something she read on there, usually a topic we've already discussed.

We once were having a discussion about boundaries. I asked if I could set some boundaries and one was not discussing that group with me. She got infuriated and went on a tirade against me, claiming my requests were ""rules, not boundaries"" and the only reason she shared that and other actions was ""a reaction to my bullshit"" so I had no right to complain about it, and how he she relies on that group for support because of my behavior so it's all ultimately my fault. She also regularly reminds me about how she might have to ""walk away from the relationship"" and how I shouldn't be bothered or offended if she does. I've told her that it's still a hurtful thing to constantly discuss if she wants to remain in it for now, which she insists she does, and is taxing on my emotional health and making it difficult to make the changes she wants.

Fast forward a month and I'm back home, my parents aren't here yet. They are going to stay a bit longer, they told me. As I visit the house I found out my dog is in the back garden, he's closed off in his dog house and doesn't have any water to drink . I start to get angry. I call my parents and demand an explenation. They tell me that they thought the veterinarian was ""too expensive"" and a neighbor feeds him now. I say what about leaving him closed in the back garden, dogs need a walk too, he stayed in there for more than a month now! I told them that if they were honest about this from the beggining I would have made sure to come visit him and at least let him go on a walk, they replied that it's none of my business (despite this being my dog as well and having literally grown up with him) and that I should stop being a bad child, that I'm ungrateful and not as nice as the other kids.

Then , one of my others friends sat down, asked to try one. I agreed and gave them one. 

Then, friend three, calling her M, walked over, dumping her bag on the table. She then , literally lunging over the table at my food. Like, she learnt all the way diagonally with her arm outstretched to make a grab at them, not a word said to me. 

I reacted and pulled them away, holding them under the table. They looked at me and said “ HEY. COME ON- “

And I told them they couldn’t have one. 

They asked why ‘becuase I gave them two some’ and I said becuase they asked, while she just lunged for my shit without even saying hi to me. 

A few other people proceeded to ask for them, and I gave them some. Except for one other person who also just launched themselves at me without asking.

M proceeded to plead with me and apologise and ask ‘nicely’. But I told them they’re only saying that becuase I told her to, and didn’t let her have one. Me finishing them off.

Apparently I’m the asshole for excluding her, but I was just upset that she lunged straight for my food before even acknowledging me. Everyone else I shared with asked.

For our anniversary, I wanted to do a nice thing, you know, arrange a nice date. So I wrote him a heartfelt letter, talking about things we've been through together, reasons I love him, you know, the cliché stuff that somehow feels good when you are in a relationship. But also to very cheesily ask him out on a date for our anniversary. (The plan was to cook him his favorite meal, watch the movie we saw on our first date, and... well, happy endings all around, ya know?)

So on the day itself, I ask him what his plan for the day was, and he says a few things, amongst them spend the evening with friends. I am kind of baffled at this. He seemed genuinely enthusiastic when he read my letter, and now he just completely forgot. I mean, it's not the first time he forgets plans, but this time I made a whole plan and spent so much time on that letter. And he just forgot.

So to the douchey part: I am a little ashamed to say I ripped up my letter and left it on the dinner table, where I knew he would find it, and didn't cook dinner, but instead went out for a bite with a friend after work.

Now my partner says I completely overreacted and that it was a real inconvenience that he had to cook for himself now, while he had plans with friends for which he didn't wanna be late (I am generally home earlier, which is why I generally do the cooking) that I should have just reminded him a few times if I didn't want him to forget, but... he is a grown ass man, I feel like I shouldn't have to remind him of a date I clearly went out of my way to ask him for.

0,"AITA for not making enough vegetarian empanadas for everyone? | First things first : this isn't a validation or an awefullbrag post. If the result is very clear it wasn't for karma whoring... I am just horrible in reading social queues and feel guilty very fast.

So yesterday we had a friends get together. We were 5 meat eaters and two vegetarians. I decided to make empanadas. So I made about 25 meat/chicken empanadas and 10 cheese empanadas. So everyone could eat 5 empanadas ideally. I love to cook so it's not a problem.

When they all arrived I was taking out the second sheet of empanadas and started to put them on different plates. 1 plate for Chicken one for meat and one for cheese. So I put them on the table and explain which is which. One of the meat eaters wanted to take one of the cheese empanadas and I told them that I had just made enough of them for our two vegetarian friends. They looked kinda put off at me and just took one of the other ones. So the night progresses and one of the vegetarians comes up to me and asks me if I had made anymore of the cheese empanadas because their tray only had 3 left and both of them had only eaten 1 per person. I was kinda shocked because I had made enough for everyone and it wasn't such a big get together that people wouldn't have heard me. So I paused the music and reminded the people that the cheese empanadas were only enough for 2 people and to please be more considerate of others. I was a bit annoyed by this point but let it go.

This young girl came in, she couldn’t have looked older than 16-17 years old. I would say she even looked younger but she was driving a car, so she had to be at least 16. 

She came to purchase a bottle of hard liquor, and a case of beer. She looked a little frustrated and seemed to be in a rush. Now, I will admit I already expected her to hand me a piece of cardboard with a fake picture on it, but she handed me what looked like a real ID. 

I stared at the ID for a while trying to catch any mistakes because she really looked so young! So at this point she seems a little irritated and she says “yes I know I look young—I just turned 21 this January”. So in my head I’m thinking she’s saying this to play it off because she knows I’m suspicious. I didn’t say anything I just looked at her and swiped the ID on the computer. It went through. 

So I told my co worker in our language that she really looks so young and I wouldn’t be surprised if she was not 21 like she says. She paid for her things and before she left she called me an asshole in my language, I will admit I was embarrassed. 

But now I’m left wondering if I was an asshole because I was trying to do the right thing, didn’t know if this was an undercover cop or something and I did not want to get my store in trouble.

0,"AITA for encouraging my BF to pursue his business idea? Now he's dead broke. | Roughly a year and a half ago my (24F) boyfriend Xavier (29M) expressed interest in quitting his full time job and starting up his own business. We have seperate finances and we plan to keep it that way. I have no stake in his financial success (or lack thereof). 

From the get go Xavier's family were not supportive of his business idea. They didn't believe his business could directly compete against 2 already established local businesses in the area and they strongly discouraged him from quitting his job. 

Xavier was crushed by his family's reaction. He turned to me for support and (naively) I gave it to him. I strongly encouraged him to pursue his dreams. I told him he was clever,  hard working, dedicated and perserverent and he could achieve anything he set his mind to. I encouraged Xavier to live his life without regrets and rise up to the challenge. Basically a lot of motivational crap talk that in hindsight seems stupid now. 

 At the time,  I genuinely believed Xavier had a decent chance of succeeding because he has a brilliant work ethic and a brilliant mind. However,  I knew there was also a good chance he would fail and lose money but I assumed Xavier knew the risks. 

Flash forward to today and Xavier's family were right - Xavier's business turned out to be a complete flop. There aren't enough clients for the business to be sustainable and he can't compete against the local competition. Xavier's in massive debt (he put all of his savings into the business and also took out a massive business loan) and he's been forced to close the business because he cannot keep it in operation without pouring more money into it. Now Xavier's currently looking for a full time job to replace the job he once had. He's also had to move back in with his parents because he can't afford rent or bills right now. 

Although the choice was ultimately Xavier's,  I am recieving all the blame from Xavier's family for steering him in the wrong direction. They believe he would have never quit his job if it wasn't for me. His Father believes I fed him false hope and pretty much ruined his life. His Mother sent me a ridiculously long  message saying  I was happy to let Xavier crash and burn because our finances are seperate and if I really loved him I would have looked out more for his financial security. 

Xavier doesn't blame me at all and our relationship is still strong despite what his family thinks.

Things like that. All of this annoys me, but I got especially pissed off at her the other day.

I felt like I was trying to protect her from this- it’s a huge jump from teen fiction to harlequin romance, especially for someone like her.

Yesterday, I announced to Year 10's (UK School System) that I will be taking some kids to ice skating for three hours during a school day.

•Been excluded or put into isolation.

•Have got more than five detentions this year.

•One student even punched a teacher!

•Have had two or more meetings with their tutor or me.

The place that has the orchid is right by our house I told him exactly where it was he came back from the store without it saying I couldn’t find it. I go to the store, find it and because they only had a few left, I buy it for myself. 

I had already gotten a gift for his mother a one of a kind piece of home decor and upon getting asked my husband do you think your mom would like this for Mother’s Day? He answered yes, I think she would like it. Yesterday his mom said she didn’t want anything to which I replied well we already got you something, she got very excited and I in turn matched her excitement, it felt good to bring her some joy. When we got off the phone he said let’s get her something for her instead of for the house and I said yea that sounds like a good idea. We look online for a present, a top stating her new status as a gma or jewellery. We end up settling on a door knocker. Today rolls around  and H says he found another one he felt she would like better it’s a bit more expensive.

He replied “Honestly I didn’t think she would like what you got her. Then you told her we got her something so now we have to.” 
“Well then why did you say she would like it if that wasn’t the case?”
“Because I didn’t want to hurt your feelings.”
“Well it hurts my feelings that you lied to me and that you’re doing all of this for your mother but haven’t done anything for me.”

That fucking sent me through the roof!

I admit we are to blame for this. Our eldest wasn’t at all addicted to the screen and didn’t need specific times. It made it harder when we had our daughter and she obviously was. We’ve tried to help her get better at it, but it’s lead to fights. This year she started mirror school and her first report card was less than great. We had been checking her homework but as it turns out, she had been lying to us for awhile about what all of her homework was. 

As a result, we met with her teachers to game plan. She has a planner she must write her homework in and get signed by each teacher, and we check it every day. (The low grades were from not doing the work, not that she didn’t get it). And until her grades are up, no TV. She’s not grounded from anything else, she can go out with friends or use the computer to talk to them. It’s just the TV because it obviously kept coming before school. She was upset at first but then agreed.

Fast forward a week. My son (17) got a movie after work and wanted to watch it. My husband and I agreed. My daughter was getting ready to watch it and I reminded her no TV. She left the room upset. Later she told me this new rule often left her feeling left out as we can all watch TV but she can’t. We do watch TV at night, but if she wants to do other stuff we can. My husband thinks we should change the rules if we as a family are watching because otherwise, she’s left out. I say, we should stick to it. He thinks I’m being mean.

0,"AITA For Thinking My Husband Shouldn’t Attend This Bachelor Party? | My husband let me know last weekend that he was invited to a bachelor party early summer this year. I asked for who, since we have 5 weddings to attend this year. He said it is for Jim, who were aren’t friends with but have many friends in common. We also are not invited to his wedding because, well, we’re just not that close. 

I told my husband I thought that was a little weird and tacky but went on to ask more details about the party. The bachelor party weekend is going to be held in an AirBnB on a lake that my husband and I keep a boat and camp on. 

Immediately I expressed that I felt he had only been invited so that he could take the party out on our boat. He replied that he had thought so, too, but there are 12 guys, which is too many people for our small bow rider.

The next day, he told me they were looking at renting a larger boat to take out for a day. The thing is, you need to be licensed to operate anything over 25hp on this lake and my husband would be the only licensed operator in the group. 

I told him that he can do whatever he wants, but I feel like the group is using him and I’m really uncomfortable with him spending $400+ for a bachelor weekend when we aren’t close to the couple, we aren’t invited to the wedding and money is a little tight for us right now. He doesn’t seem to see anything wrong with it. So, AITA for feeling this way?",False,False
0,"AITA for refusing to let go of my grudge against my stepfather? | Throwaway account. 

I [23M] have something of a hefty backstory. My bio father left my mum while she was pregnant and idek who he is. She remarried when I was 3 to my stepfather and had my first sister a year later. Stepfather had always been cold towards me, but when his own kid was born, he basically decided he didn't want to raise someone else's child too and I got put into care. I was in and out of the care system (mostly in it) until I was 15, when I was graciously allowed back into my family home because I was grown up enough now that he wouldn't have to deal with me. 

Now, my time in care was awful. I'm sure you've all heard the horror stories about what hapems to kids in the system sometimes, and that I don't need to go into too much detail. Any time I saw my mum I would beg her to come home but he just simply wouldn't allow it. I grew a really intense feeling of resentment towards my stepfather, and I still have it because honestly, fuck him for making me go through that. 

Now the man is sick. It could be terminal, but he's receiving treatment so potentially not. Mum wants me to make ammends with him, just in case, but I've no interest in that. I've told her as much, and told her why. She keeps telling me to ""see his side"", like that makes it any better. He shoved me into the system because he's too proud to raise another man's child? What kind of a justification is that? Mum keeps talking about how difficult it was for him to have a child with a disability, which he does as my second sister has Down's syndrome, but that's also a bs justification because: 1. I'd already been in the system for *four years* when she was born and 2. Her intellectual disability/developmental delay is really mild and she's honestly more or less on the same level as other kids her age and always has been, so it isn't like she has really difficult to cater to special needs. He's tried using the ""problem child"" excuse, and while it's true I acted out as a teenager, I believe that was a result of being in the system, not vice versa. 

TL;DR: my stepdad put me in care when my sister was born bc he didn't want to raise another man's kid now he had his own. Now he's sick and wants forgiveness but I still hold him responsible for the hellish experience I had in the system.",False,False
1,"AITA for wearing a “real men don’t lift weights” shirt to the gym? | I (20F) found a shirt with the words “real men don’t lift weights” in large font at the mall for $20. I thought it was funny and it’s comfortable, so I bought one. I go to the gym regularly and lift weights occasionally. I don’t really care whether guys lift weights. My boyfriend lifts weights occasionally too, but I mostly go to the gym alone since I usually go when it opens and my boyfriend likes to lift late at night. 


Yesterday morning was the first time I wore the shirt. I wore it to the gym. I got quite a few more looks than usual and got a few compliments on my shirt. But after I finished my cardio and moved on to the weights, this guy who was already at the weights area asked me to explain what the shirt meant. I think I’ve seen him a few times before. He’s fairly tall and well-built. 


I told him that it was just a funny shirt I found and I couldn’t care less whether guys lift weights. He told me to stop lying and said no girls like guys who don’t lift weights. I told him that’s not true. He then asked me why I’m here if not to look at buff guys. I told him that I’m here to work out and to please leave me alone. He then said he never sees me using any weights over 10 pounds so I’m clearly not here to improve. 


I told him to fuck off or I’ll report him. I think he then said “I know you admiring” or something dumb like that and continued his workout. I was pretty uncomfortable being that close to him so I wrapped up my workout early. I told my boyfriend about this and he did the whole I told you so thing because he already predicted I would piss off some meathead at the gym after I showed him the shirt.",False,False
1,"AITA for giving a child McDonalds when her mum said she isn’t allowed it? | My daughter and her friend are 8 and her friend was at ours the other day. I took them out and I asked my daughter where they wanted to get food from and she said McDonalds. My kid doesn’t eat it a lot cause I know it’s not great for them, but it doesn’t kill her to have it once in a while. I asked her friend is that’s what she wanted and she started crying and saying she wasn’t allowed it. I said not to cry we could go somewhere else, or we could just keep it a secret and her mum didn’t need to know. She said she wanted it so I said just don’t tell your mum!

0,"AITA for not disclosing that I'm a felon on my dating profile? | When I was 19, I made the worst and stupidest mistake of my life. I needed money, and I altered the amount on a check a relative sent me for my birthday before I cashed it. I was arrested and subsequently charged and convicted of felony check fraud, my first and only criminal offense. It was wrong, I have no excuse for doing it, and I have regretted my actions every single day since. I hurt my relationship with my family and betrayed the trust of someone who cared about me, and I can't forgive myself for that. The conviction was a wake-up call I desperately needed to turn my life around. 

I recently met a really great girl online, and we hit it off right away. On our second date, I worked up the courage to tell her about my conviction. She seemed to take it okay during the date, but when she got home, she texted me to say that she didn't think it was going to work out and that I really should have disclosed the fact that I was a felon on my profile. She said it was dishonest of me to have left out that information. 

I completely understand that being a felon is a dealbreaker for a lot of people. I don't fault anyone for that, and I always bring up my past within the first few dates, before things get serious. But I don't really want to have to put ""I was convicted of a felony five years ago"" in my online bio. I guess I'd like to have a chance for people to get to know me first and not just immediately associate me with the thing I'm most ashamed of. Maybe that's selfish of me, I don't know. I admittedly don't have a lot of online dating experience, so I could use some perspective on this. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for deleting a photo of myself on my Mom's phone? | Backstory: Cockfighting is (unfortunately) still legal in Mexico. I am very against the sport, as I view it as barbaric and cruel. My grandparents own a condo in the country and invited me down for spring break. They wanted to show us the local culture in the town they are in, and took us to a ranch that raised fighting cocks. I initially did not want to go in, but I also did not want to disappoint my grandparents. They are almost 90, and we don't know how long they have left. I begrudgingly went in and pretended everything was fine. It started out innocently enough, with the rancher letting us hold the roosters. Then, I got more and more uncomfortable. He put the roosters in a cockfighting ring and had my brother and I stand on opposite sides and release the fighting cocks to simulate a match. I found out that usually, a cockfight results in both animals dying, but for this demonstration, the rancher put ""gloves"" on them so neither would get hurt (still barbaric in my opinion, though). After a couple minutes of watching them attack each other, he gathered them up and put them back in their cages. 

I was pretty disgusted by the spectacle but figured no harm was done and we left. Then, I found out that my mom and grandpa filmed me doing this. I found a video of me looking pretty uncomfortable holding a rooster obviously meant for cockfighting. When I got back to the condo, I quickly deleted anything that had me in it. When my mom and brother found out about this, they were pissed. Evidently, they are not as against the sport as I am. I had deleted the video of my brother participating because it had me in it as well. It was the only video that actually showed the roosters fighting. However, I did not delete the other pictures of him and my mom holding the animals, only the ones with me. They said that I should have asked before doing this, but I held firm that I didn't care if they allowed me to or not. I did not want a photo of myself doing something that I have a huge ethical issue with, even if it was legal and only done to make my grandparents happy. 


Was I in the wrong for deleting these without asking first? I don't regret it, as I don't want anyone getting the idea that cockfighting is something I support. Should I have kept the video if my brother wanted me to?


Also, how should I approach my grandparents about this? They have footage of me as well, which I would like them to delete, but I don't want to hurt their feelings or act less grateful for how inviting me.

1,"AITA for calling myself 'poor' when my family has a lot of money? | So I was texting some people in a groupchat earlier today and the topic turned to fashion/shoes. The thing is that I'm actually pretty into dressing nice, and especially with shoes. My parents are fairly wealthy (both doctors), but they're also pretty stereotypical Asian parents: they see buying hyped up shoes as a waste of money, don't give me an allowance, and so on. So technically I have a net worth of $0. 

Anyhow, I texted that 'I would be a sneakerhead if I had money but I'm poor so...'. Most people in the groupchat either just responded with 'lol' or something like that, or agreed. But one girl, let's call her Sarah, got a bit pissed off. Btw, she's not poor, she lives in my neighborhood, and her mom  works with my dad.

She started going off about how 'You're not poor, you're rich' and 'you don't know what it's like to be poor' and so on and so forth. To this, I responded that 1) To a certain extent, yes, I did grow up pretty comfortably, but I have a net worth of $0. Which is literally poor. Besides, I don't have any money of my own, so I'm not rich, my parents are. And besides, she's taking a casual text way too seriously.

She demanded I 'apologize', and I said I wouldn't, because I didn't do anything wrong.

So I lost my wallet on the bus last Saturday. Let’s call the bus company AlwaysEarly. I filled up a lost property form on their website and I got a call back on Monday morning, luckily. I had also received an email from them saying I was all clear to pick up my wallet, a reference code and AlwaysEarly’s bus depot address. The bus route included a connection so I had to take two of their buses. Mind you, my bus pass was in my wallet so in order to get on the bus I just showed the FIRST bus driver the email (didn’t want to pay). He was happy to let me on. When boarding the SECOND bus, I tried showing the driver the email and he didn’t even read. Gave me an attitude and said “if you want to get on this bus, you gotta pay!”. I tried explaining the situation to him and he wouldn’t listen. Luckily, one of AlwaysEarly’s bus managers was at the bus stop. She read my email and told me to get on. As I passed the bus driver I looked at him and said: “Next time read it yeah”. The bus manager called me out and said there’s no need for that. I was just annoyed that the driver didn’t even hear me out and gave me a bullish attitude.  My accompanying friend thought it was a total dick move and I was being degrading.",False,False

1,"AITA for giving my honest ratings on the attractiveness of each women at the party I was at? | We’re all around 20 years old here. My friend Johnny hosted a party last night at his place. There were like 12 people. 5 women. This took place late into the party with a few drinks in. I was one of the two guys there without a girlfriend. Some of the women there said I’m pretty hot and wanted me to rate all 5 of the women there. They think hot guys have a better eye for this. All the women agreed to it. They’re all in a relationship and 3 of them had their boyfriends with them. I don’t think I’m a Chad or anything and I also told them that I’m uncomfortable rating them because I know women get jealous easily and it’s my first time meeting 2 of them. The women, and later even the men, kept pressuring me. 


I thought what the heck and caved in. I told them my scale is from 0-10, mean of 5, and follows a normal distribution, so don’t get upset by a low-sounding score. Jennifer, who’s my friend, told me to shut up and just rate them. I started off from my left. I rated Tammy, who’s also my friend, a 6. Before I could go on, Tammy asked me why the fuck I rated her so low. I told her I’m not here to discuss that and hurt feelings, but rather to only dish out the numbers. The girls started laughing at Tammy. I told them again that 5 is the average and 6 is a standard deviation above. Jennifer told me to shut up again. I rated Rachel, who I met for the first time, a 7. Uproar ensued as Tammy got pissy. I then rapidfired my numbers at the end to end this quickly. I gave Jennifer an honest 5.5, Eileen, who’s new to me, an 8, and Carly, who’s my friend, a 7. 


They were all tripping out about my ratings and Jennifer was the pissiest of them all. She was the only one who kept attacking me and said I must be blind or purposefully rating her the lowest because  she was the one who pressured me the most into rating them. I told her that I’m dipping because I couldn’t handle so much cattiness in one place. I’ve been getting some flak from my friend Xavier for rating his girlfriend Jennifer the lowest because she’s been pissy all day. I told him that she wanted to play a stupid game and won a stupid prize. He wants me to apologize to Jennifer, but I told him that my opinion doesn’t matter and he’s the one who should treat her like a princess so she doesn’t go out seeking validation from other guys. Xavier said he couldn’t get through to her. I told him to give her some time and she’ll be fine and might even apologize to me for how she acted. I didn’t get a response.",False,False
0,"AITA for throwing a donut my boyfriend wanted me to eat in the garbage? | I've been wanting to lose roughly ten pounds for a while now. I'm at a healthy weight but I want to be skinnier and tone up more as well as I feel it'll give me more confidence in my body. I tend to lack control when it comes to food and I tend to give in to junk food a lot which really distracts from my weight loss goals. So I told my boyfriend to no longer buy me junk food because I'm really committed to losing weight and I have a hard time saying no when delicious sweets are right under my nose. 

A few days later, he brings home two donuts but claims they are both for him. Suddenly, he's practically pushing for me to eat the second donut with him, telling me it's just ONE donut and it would be rude to refuse. I could already feel myself tempted to take it and eat it, and after saying no like 3 times, I just accepted the donut from him but threw it in the garbage. Even though I reimbursed him right away (these donuts are like $5 each) he is still really offended by what I did because he claims he planned on eating the second  if I really didn't want to.

1,"AITA for buying a cat litter box for my girlfriends parents, and then saying things about how bad the situation was? | This happened yesterday.

But first a little backstory: Everytime I go to my gf's parents apartment (she lives with them), as soon as I open the entrance door, I can smell a literal cat shit odour. It's not that strong, but still noticeable. My gf tells me that they do ""everything the can"" to minimize the smell, but when I go to the cat's litter box, it's far too small (<10cm in height) and has so little sand in there that the poor cat can't even hide the turds. There's no way, there's so little sand that there are spots where there is none. The cat basically has to unbury a turd to hide another. Almost everytime I go there, I say out loud ""ouh, that smell..."" and sometimes I even said to my gf that she should put more sand in the litter box. Once I even poured sand that they had in the box and the smell vanished.

Well, knowing that problem they had, today I said to my gf ""let's buy a generic box and a lot of sand"". We got shopping and I carefully selected a big box with +-15cm in height and which was pretty big in size. Then I proceeded and bought 3 packs with 4kg sand each. After some time we went back to her home, I greetet everyone with ""Look what I bought!"", put the litter box on the table, opened a pack, poured the whole in there, making 4cm of sand, which was the recom. min. amount of sand. 
Her mum looked at that whole package being gone and said ""gf, that's too much sand, put a little bit back into the pack"", to which I replied ""Nah, that is the recom. amount. The cat must bury her necessities that's why it stank."" The answer was exactly the same again ""Put some back into the pack.""
While walking out with the box, I (jokingly) answered ""Nah, if you guys want to be cheap with sand I go get buy more.""
I then heard her dad mumble something, but since I didn't understand a word, I moved on.
When I came back, her dad wasn't on the couch anymore, and I heard a loud thump coming from slamming a door.
As it turned out (gf told me), her dad said ""Say to your bf he should watch his mouth"" and then almost immediately following with ""I will retire myself"" and then slam his bedroom door.
I then looked to my gf and asked what's happening, and her response basically was: ""Hey, you were mean and said unnecessary things. They know it and it's inconvenient.""
I then just said to her ""You dad is just too serious"", to which she said ""No, you were inconvenient. My parents loved the attitude, but saying those things and calling my parents cheap isn't the right thing to do"". I then told her that I was joking, but apparently it wasn't received well.
I then felt pretty unwelcomed there and asked to go home.

I know I shouldn't have said exactly what I said, but I did a favor, bought things for a cat that isn't even mine, etc

My gf even said in the car ""You also wouldn't like it if someone comes into your home, telling that things are smelling bad, etc"", to which I replied: ""I wouldn't mind, even less if the person buys stuff for me."" to which she disagreed.",False,False

I’ll come right out and say I never really liked her. She’s in grad school living off her daddys money while my brother has a high paying finance job. It looks like she was just trying to find a new pay check for when her dad stops covering everything and shes using my brother for that.

My brother arranged a massive proposal where both families and all their friends would come celebrate after he proposed. She really pissed me off at the celebration. If shes really just shy, why is she suddenly all over my brother, kissing him and sitting in his lap and talking to everyone.

It rubbed me the wrong way that she couldn’t just roll with the joke and needed to assert herself suddenly when she was never even talking to us before.

N is the first grandchild in my family so my mother was very ecstatic about it. Wife didn't want her visiting while at the hospital, which was disappointing for my mother but ultimately she was giving birth so it was fine. 

After three days, we went home with N, and it's been around three weeks now but my wife is reluctant to let people into our house to see N. She doesn't want to deal with the stress of being a host while recovering. Which I get, that's fine too. But my mother hasn't seen N yet in person.

My wife was taking an afternoon nap, so I took N with me for a short visit to my mother's place. I left my wife a text on her phone, and a note next to the bed. N is a healthy baby, I wouldn't have taken him out if he was sickly, I brought nappies and formula with me too just in case he was hungry.

But my wife didn't take it well. She blew up my phone, had her side of the family ring me non-stop to bring N back. Now I'm in a fight with the missus because she thinks I had no right to take our child to see my mother while she was sleeping. I took advantage of her ""vulnerable time"" and went behind her back. 

I don't get why she's so against letting N out into the world, and it's actually hurtful that she doesn't want my mother to see our child after three weeks.

She asked if I can take her cat to my house for the week that she'd be away.  I cannot have cats in my apartment per my lease.  (Not as in ""you have to pay $x to have a pet"", it's ""you cannot have a cat"").  She refuses to board the cat because of its anxiety issues.

When I told her that I couldn't keep the cat at my place, she suggested that I stay at her place for the week.  I straight up didn't want to, and I don't feel like it's fair for that to be the expectation.  I told her that I wouldn't feel comfortable staying there for a week, and pitched checking in on the cat every day.  She agreed.

While she was away, and between me checking in, apparently it got pretty bored and went to town on the carpet on the stairs.  It tore up a chunk about the size of a fist, through the underpadding and down into the plywood flooring underneath.

I'm not sure how my friend is going to react to it, and if she turns out to be pissed, will I be the asshole in this situation for not staying at her house for a week over Christmas, since theoretically my being there could have prevented it from being bored and/or alone for long enough to do that much damage?  Should I be prepared to give her some money to help pay for repairs of the damage?",False,False
1,"AITA for think my best friend is replacing me? | I (24f) have been best friends with 'Kyle' (23m) since elementary school. He's a great guy and the only bumps in the road we've had are when I proposed a FWB situation that was uninterested in. (It was a little awkard after but we got past it and now joke about it)

We always hang out but ever since he got with his girlfriend a few months ago it hasn't been happening as much. We used to hang out like four or five times a week but since he got with her it's been like half that. When we do hang out it's like it always is but I can't help but feel like he's just waiting to leave to be with her.

Not to mention I don't think she's that good for him. He and I are both outgoing and wild people and she's like a little mouse. He's always dated girls who dress to impress and her style is very stuck in pants, tank top and cardigans. She doesn't like going to bars a lot and the few times she has joined us (Kyle, me and other friends) she nurses her one drink all night and mainly talks to Kyle or our friend M, who actually introduced Kyle and her. I tried talking to Kyle about it but he said he likes who he likes and it shouldn't matter as long as she's not hurting people.

But what really gets to me is that I feel like she's trying to push me out. Kyle has a niece 'B' who is half black and his girlfriend is mixed as well so she's always doing her hair, telling her mom what products to use and how to take care of it, things like that. Now B thinks she's the best thing in the world when I used to be like the fun aunt. At Kyle's nephew's birthday party (B's brother) B ran straight to her and wouldn't leave her side the whole time, telling everyone how she's sooo good at braiding hair and knows how to comb it without hurting. 

&#x200B;

It hurt because B used to really like me and it feels like one more thing that's been taken from me. I ended up telling Kyle all of this and he said that it sucked my feelings were hurt but she wasn't doing anything wrong and that maybe we should step back from our friendship until I could see things clearly.

I don't think I'm being crazy to say that she's taking him from me in some way. So, Reddit, AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for not inviting extended family to my child’s b-day party? | We are having my soon to be four year old’s birthday party in a few weeks. We are inviting mostly only friends and family with children. My MIL (who is the most judgmental, inconsistent and out of touch with reality person I’ve ever met but I digress) has a best friend with a 3 year old grandchild my child has played with a few times. So we invited them, but not my MIL’s two brothers, sister, and spouses because they don’t have young grandchildren or anything. My MIL confronted me and told me it’s “weird” I’m inviting her best friend and not her family and I explained why, she then blew up my husband’s phone with texts about it, then even went so far as to text my own mother about how she’s not happy about it. Annoying thing is we did this exactly last year for our child’s 3rd birthday and she didn’t complain then. Maybe her family complained about not being invited but again, our house is small, and we want it to be a more child-orientated event because it is for a four year old, not us. AITA?",False,False

Wife and I have been married for 25 years, and wife's drinking has progressively gotten worse over the years.  Their father is an non-drinking (now) alcoholic - been on the wagon for pretty much 3-4 decades.

I mentioned my wife's drinking 10 years ago to BIL and wife went ballistic. But since then her drinking just keeps getting worse.  In fact, in the past few months she's fallen down (gave herself two black eyes in the process), and been so drunk on two occasions she lost control of bodily functions (once pee one diarrhea) walking down the hall (thankfully we have hardwood floors)  to the bathroom, not realizing what she had done and I eventually accidentally stepped in them.  She passes out on a nightly basis and she goes through at least 6 bottles of wine, a 1.75L or Vodka,  and a 1.75L of Rum each week.

We saw my BIL at Christmas when my wife was recovering from her black eyes (still QUITE visible) and BIL asked what happened and she stated she tripped on a cushioned mat in our kitchen.  BIL knows that I would never lay a finger on my wife, in fact her family jokes if they got a call that there was domestic violence at our house, they would ask if I was OK.

Our daughter (17F) asks me why she drinks so much, I have no answer other than letting her know some people do, and that grandpa is a (recovered) alcoholic, and it is genetic.  I drink, but just barely - at most 2 hard ciders a week, if that much.

I am at the end of my rope, I have tried talking to my wife and after 'an event' she stops drinking for a week or two, before going off the edge again.  She refuses to see a counselor, because she says she is afraid that if her work finds out she will lose her security clearance and, thus, her job.  I can only hope that if BIL gets involved he may be able to convince his sister to stop.",False,False
1,"AITA in this situation? My girlfriend is all worked up over brusselsprouts of all things and has been short with me all night. I think she’s being totally unreasonable and taking the most benign things personally. | backstory: my girlfriend  is cooking dinner. I come out to help her and notice she’s just turned on the rice cooker but is already pan frying Brussels sprouts. I tell her she should wait until the rice is done or almost done because what she’s frying is going to be done long before the rice. she gets a little frustrated angrily turns of the burner and goes to the room. 

I chill and play games waiting for the rice to ding and when it does she comes out and we both go to the kitchen. She begins frying the sprouts again very briefly while I prepare something else and then she turns off the burner and set them aside. I go and check them and feel that the outside layer is hot but the inside layer is still hard and raw I tell her “oh I think it’s not done yet they’re still hard” and she gets pissed and is like “alright you should do it yourself then!” And storms off. I think to myself that she’sbeing unreasonable. 

She comes back and I try to talk with her, she gives short answers and snaps. I ask her why she’s mad she shouts “because I’m cooking and you come complain to me!” I keep quiet and keep frying the damn sprouts and no matter how much I try they’re still hard and raw in the middle so i learned WHY people roast them and that’s because it needs to be cooked over a period of time to cook it through. So I give up and take them off the heat and put them aside. 
When everything is done she puts all the sprouts on my plate. We sit down to eat and I’m intentionally avoiding the nasty bitter raw sprouts and she takes one off my plate and eats it and says “are they okay? they’re not very good” So I said “no I think they need more time to cook because the middle won’t cook fast enough.” And then she shouts “well how should I know?! You told me to wait for the rice to cook them so I waited and cooked them same time with the rice finished!”

I’m just so confused at this point so I’m like “what? What are you even talking about? No I mean frying them doesn’t work. Even when I fried them I couldn’t get them cooked it’s better to roast them!” And she answers back with “you didn’t you tell me to roast them?!” And I say “because at the time I didn’t know! I didn’t know you couldn’t really cook them through by pan frying them until I tried it!” And she still not getting what I’m trying to say answers back “it’s because you told me to wait for the rice!!” And I’m like “no! What I’m trying to tell you is that it doesn’t matter if you fried them 30 minutes ago or when the rice was done the result would be the same because they won’t cook through!” But halfway through that she cut me off and began yelling over me “it’s okay! It’s fine it’s finished! don’t want to talk anymore!” And then we silently finished eating and she stormed off to the room.",False,False

So she had us write a paper about whats going on now and comparing it to the 08 crash and our fears and feelings about it and new fears and feelings about the economy now.

Thing is... 08 and 09 were AWESOME for me. My little 9ish year old self had a fun couple of years. Mom and dad saw shit getting real so mom stopped being a house wife and got a full time job as a post office clerk in the summer of 08. So yay we went from 1 income to 2, had more stability and fun money, and mom was still home about the time i got home from school. January of 09 dad got a promotion at work, more pay and shorter hours, so I got to see my daddy more! And again the household income went up. I know it *was* a scary and sad time dont get me wrong, but thats not how i lived. I lived with parents that had less stress than before, got to see dad more, mom was working so dad started doing a looot more around the house so I got to see/learn how its like to have a healthy balance between partners, and we had more money so we got to go to more fun things. Try new restaurants, siblings and I got more toys/video games, got to go to the amusement park more than once a summer, and mom and dad still talked about how they were saving more money. So yeah... good times.

Now, well my fiance just got his masters degree in CS, and a promotion at his job due to it, and is helping me through uni with money to spare. Yeah, you can see where this is going. Things are headed up again. So thats what I put in my paper. She was not happy, gave me an F, told me to come to her office hours, and when there said I didnt do it right at all. She said she wanted my fears and worries not for me to brag about how great life is for me and me alone.

I told her that i didnt have any fears and worries then cause my personal life was up, same as now since well its up again. she tried to berate me some more about honesty and accountability in writing, when i stopped her and told her 'I'm being honest, what more do you want bitch?!'.

1,"AITA for wanting to replace an item I broke, instead of giving cash? | About a week ago, I tried a neighborhood kid's old-school retro plastic skateboard.  It was in good shape, almost new. I'm not a fat ass, but I stood on it for less than a minute, and the board broke in half. I felt bad, so I instantly offered the kid one of my (better) wooden skateboards. He's too young to understand quality, so he wants a plastic one again. Fine. 
I walk him home and tell his mom what happened. I offer to replace his skateboard. She tells me it was about $40 (for a piece of shit that broke in half?), and she got it on Amazon. We go back and forth a couple of days because they no longer have the same color, though I'm willing to get him the same board different color. 
Now, yesterday at the bus stop where are kids get on/off together, I told her I'm ordering the skateboard. She asks if I ordered it yet. I said, ""No, because I just want to make sure it's a color your son wants."" She then tells me, ""Well, if you can't get the same color, it's okay. We'll just take the cash for it.""
That just gave me a weird feeling. I'm happy to replace the skateboard, but don't like the idea of just giving them cash instead. It makes me feel like maybe this kid didn't even like skateboarding anyway, and this was an opportunity to get his money back.

0,"AITA for telling my MIL to ""be useful or leave""? |  Things are very hectic at my household. My husband was recently in a car crash because of another driver trying to run a red light, he ended up with a 3 broken ribs, a minor leg fracture and a few cuts and bruises. I made arrangements to work from home so I could care for my husband and also to give a better support to our kids since they were pretty shaken by the entire thing. On top of that I have also been helping my husband deal with the resulting paperwork from the accident.

A week ago my MIL decided to come over to help us. First, I was thrilled by the offer but then I realized that the help she wanted to offer consisted of only taking (very minimal) care of my husband and that was it. So I still had to deal with his aftercare + everything I already mentioned + house chores. Her role being that of keeping my husband company and giving him the medicaments when needed. 

It all came down to a head yesterday when I had to run by my workplace to sort out an issue. This threw all the plans I had out of the window and I had no other choice but go. I told my MIL I hadn't made dinner and would not be able to make it. She said it was all right and told me not to worry. But then, when I got back home at 6pm or so, I learn that she only made dinner for my husband and had snacks herself while cooking. When I confronted her about it, she said that she thought I gave her a warning because she was the one taking care of my husband so she understood it as being his dinner. 

I told her that this was not the case. When she offered to help, I accepted because I needed it but her help was not being helpful at all. She responded by saying that she had a responsibility with her son; she was doing her part, and I had to do mine. This ended up being the last drop for me and I told her she could either be useful or she could pack up her things and leave. After this I didn't see her for the rest of the night, I ordered food and asked one of my kids to tell her about it but she did not come down and from what I saw she didn't touch the food at all.

I told my husband what had happened (he was asleep during the argument since he's taking medication) and he said he understood but I was too harsh with her. This afternoon she left, she talked with my husband about what happened and said she does not pretend to visit us again any time soon.

0,"AITA for not donating blood, even though I have the rarest type, because I'm terrified? | So I have AB negative blood, I think something less than 1% of the population has it. And I would really want to donate, but I am legitimately horrified at the thought.

Backstory: When I was 18, one of those blood-donation vans came to my high school. It was the first time I had ever been old enough to donate, so myself and a friend went together. I had my blood typed a few years earlier and I knew I was AB negative. 

Don't know if any of you have been in one of those vans, but they sit you in these reclining chairs, insert the withdrawing needle, and you're supposed to relax (and squeeze one of those cush balls) for a few minutes until they collect enough blood. And if you tap out before they collect enough, they actually have to throw out any blood they collected from you, they can't just keep it.

So a few minutes into getting it drawn, I'm starting to feel horrible. The nurse couldn't get it in the vein for a few tries, so my arm hurts, I'm weak, my brain is foggy and I'm starting to hear a rushing sound in my ears. Then all the warmth started to drain from my body. I wanted to maybe tell a nurse, but I knew if I wimped out early, all my blood would be wasted. 

I look over at my friend, and she immediately starts freaking out, apparently because I'm pale as hell and my eyes glazed over. And the last thing I remember is getting this surge of fear and ripping out the needle. Blood everywhere, and I passed the fuck out.

That was a few years ago, and ever since then I've been terrified of donating blood, and needles, and doctors. If I see blood I will legitimately feel like I'm going to pass out again. 

I recently told this story to a few friends, and one of them (a nurse) said that even if I had one bad experience, I need to get over it because my blood type is so rare. 

She's been pretty insistent about it, even pointing out that there's a collection center not too far from my work.

I'm conflicted. On the one hand, she's a medical professional, and seems really upset that I'm 'wasting' my blood. And it's not like I have a real phobia or something, it just freaks me out. 

On the other hand, it REALLY freaks me out. So should I just suck it up and donate?",False,False
0,"AITA for wearing high heels as a tall woman at someone’s wedding. | Yesterday, I attended the wedding of my boyfriend’s former piano tutor as his plus one. The wedding was quite fancy and everyone was in formal wear for the ceremony and reception, which were held inside a chateau.

I am 21 and quite tall for a woman at 5’11. I am also a model. My boyfriend is also tall at 6’5. We usually get stares when we are together, I suppose mainly because of our height. 

For the wedding, I wore a long gown which was in accordance with the dress code. I also wore 3.5 inch heels with my gown. I didn’t think that was unusual...nearly every female was wearing heels at the wedding.

At the wedding, my boyfriend and I got some stares, but of course the main attention was focused on the bride, who was beautiful. 

About 20 minutes before the ceremony began, the mother of the bride came over to me and politely asked if I could remove my heels and offered a pair of flats that belonged to the maid of honour. She said that my height was “distracting” and she was afraid that I’d block the view of those sitting in the back rows (my BF and I were sitting somewhere in the middle). I thought it was an odd request because my BF is next to me and he’s half a foot taller than me...should he crouch down? But I didn’t want to argue with the mother of the bride. I wore my own pair of flats that I had brought. She said thank you and left.

After the ceremony, I thought this meant I could wear my heels again. But apparently not, because when I walked into the reception area the mother of the bride looked disapprovingly at me. She did not come to talk to me but it was obvious that she was annoyed.

I found this whole thing very odd. I was a very polite guest, I wore a modest dress and makeup, nothing over the top.  Yes, I wore heels that made me over 6ft but I cannot help my height, and besides, all the other female guests were in heels. Granted I was the tallest woman among the 100 or so guests, but still. My boyfriend found it rude of the mother of the bride, but didn’t say anything.

I really did not wish to cause any problems though. Should I have worn my flats for the duration of the wedding, including the reception to minimize distractions from the bride? Or is the MOB overreacting? Thank you.",False,False
0,"AITA for joining the military to avoid looking after my father? | So little backstory, I am a 24 year old female. I broke up with a long term boyfriend about 6 months ago. The break-up was very petty on his part, and was the reason that i lost a lot of my old ""friends"". I left everything behind when i left him and basically had to start my life over.

About 2 months after i had broken up with him, i started to make some new friends and relationships. Some of these were military people who were in/thinking of joining the military. These people that i met gave me a lot of insight into what military life is like (job stability, challenging environment, getting to move and see some of our country, great pension, ect). These friends by no means painted a pretty picture, they also told me about some of the not so great parts of the training and job, such as, sleeping in the snow during a field ex. They gave me the tools and their own experiences to consider, as well, i did a TON of research on my own about the military and the job that it entailed.

So in June i decided to apply to join the military for HR (its something i am currently doing as a civilian). In my country it is a very long and tedious process. This process includes a knowledge test, a medical evaluation, an interview, and a lot of background and personal credit checks. I have also been physically training like crazy since this application to try to get in shape and gain as much muscle as i can before i get accepted in and have to go to basic training. So i have basically been working my ass off since i started this application process. If/when i get in, i will be posted away from my home province for at least a year to a year and a half at minimum for basic training and trade training.

Now, this is where i am having unsure if i am being a selfish asshole for wanting to leave to join the military.

My father has a medical injury that makes it so he cannot live on his own. Currently he is living with my grandmother because hes still fairly young and does not qualify for getting put into a ""home"" per say. This was a decision that my family has made, and i am my fathers only child, also my parents are divorced. I told my family about me wanting to join the military , and they lost their shit. The one reason that they made clear that they didn't want me to go to the military was because they expect me to ""take over"" the care of my dad in the near future. I feel like this is extremely unfair to me because i have not even had a chance to live my life yet, start a family, and i just left a 5 year long relationship and had to start over. My aunt and uncle who are insisting that i take over this care, they have two teenage children, their own house, my uncle works from home, and they are way more stable to take over this care more than i am. This same aunt and uncle don't think i can handle a military environment as well.

1,"AITA for making my girlfriends daughter move schools? | I’ve (38m) been dating my girlfriend (29f) for 5 years and we have recently decided to move in together. We’ve been wanting to move in together for a while, but between deployments and my girlfriend going to school it just hasn’t been a possibility until now. That being said we wanted to make everything official as fast as possible, so we’ve taken out a lease on a very nice house and will be completely moved in in the new year. 

Here comes the problem, my girlfriends daughter (14f) hates me and so of course she isn’t super happy about the move which is another reason we waited so long. However, her son (12m) is beyond excited, my girlfriends new job is closer to my work, and the area I’m moving them too (Coronado) is way nicer then where they were living before. Because of this move the kids will be starting new, and nicer schools. They even have specialized science lab programs that my gfs daughter has always talked about wanting. 

Now my girlfriends daughter is accusing me, to my face and behind my back. of trying to isolate her mom and her siblings from what they’ve always known. I’ve tried explaining that isn’t the case, but she won’t budge, and is insisting we let her stay at her old school. The problem is either myself or my gf would have to drive her an hour and a half one way to get her to school if that were the case. This simply isn’t feasible, I have to be at work by 0630 or earlier most days and my gf has to be in by 0800.

She ended up running out of the house and didn’t come back so around 2200 we called the police and they found her. 

My gf is now starting to side with her daughter saying that we can find a way to get her to her old school because it means a lot to her and that I went too far calling her names.

He’s an internet stranger who lives in Serbia and for all I know, he could steal my money and run. 

Also, I made the mistake of paying an influencer $750, all in advance. He disappeared for a month and was unresponsive to my emails. It wasn’t until I threatened to sue him that he grudgingly responded and asked me why I’m so stressed out. He said he couldn’t respond because he’s too busy, but funny enough he was quick to respond before he got my money. 

So I said to the Serbian influencer, I’ll pay you half up front and the other half after you post my links. He responds and says that “I’m not like other influencers” and he demanded the full payment right now. I hate arguments and I’m not a confrontational person, so I replied and said that I’d pay him the full amount in advance. 

After thinking about it all night last night, I wrote an email to the Serbian influencer explaining the bad experience I had with the other influencer and how I wasn’t comfortable with paying 100% up front.

I (31F) looooove children. I’ve always loved children. I’ve always wanted children. I was very vocal about this even as a teenager. I had names picked out for my future children by the time I was 15. If I sound like I was insufferable, I can assure you I was. In my defense, I grew up Mormon and that’s just part of the culture. I have since left the church.

I married my high school boyfriend and we are still very happy together. We waited to start trying to have children until we were financially stable, which was about five years ago.

It turns out I am infertile. I’ve had six miscarriages. Many tests have been performed and we still don’t know why this is happening. I don’t even want to get into how devastating this has been.

My issue is that people who I haven’t seen recently almost immediately bring up “so where are all those kids you wanted so badly?” Or (upon finding out I work with kids) “don’t you still want kids of your own?” Variations on this theme, you get the idea.

Part of me thinks I made my bed as a teenager and now I’m having to lie in it, but another part of me is like...if someone told me they wanted kids more than anything at one point and now doesn’t have any, I’d assume something went wrong and wouldn’t ask?

Normally I try to change the topic because I don’t like confrontation, but if pressed I just straight up go “yeah, I’ve had six miscarriages so...” obviously this makes people really uncomfortable. My answers get progressively more rude and sarcastic if they continue with “what about adoption” and “my friend thought she was infertile until she tried *insert holistic bs* and then blah blah blah” until they get the hint and stop.

1,"AITA for swinging at the park while kids waited? | I'm 25 yrs old and I live near a park that I've been going to since I was a kid. I have fond memories of it everytime I go to it and I swing while listening to music to forget all my worries. I would swing for 30-1hr, enough time to listen to some of my favorite songs and think about happy thoughts. It's my happy place. I know I'm too old to be swinging but I just love swinging there and reminiscing of my childhood. Around 3pm the kids come out of school and some would come to the park to hang or smoke weed. Some kids were hanging around the swings and I knew they wanted to swing but I just needed some time to myself to collect my thoughts and relax while listening to my music.

He is the cutest little terrier mix, very tiny. 

They just dont seem to care about him. One time we found him strolling down the street and we brought him back home.

They leave him outside all summer. ALL day. I feel so bad for him, he is constantly barking.

I have two kids. Let’s call them Jake (17) and Erica (16). Not their real names but these start with the same letters.

The two of them are SUPPOSED to split chores equally. Their mother passed away last year and I work more than full time so I take on the cooking but can’t do much else. The kids have said they’re okay doing house and garden work.

Until recently. I’ve noticed that Jake has been doing ALL the yard work, gardening, and so on. Erica has started doing all the inside chores. This would still be fair except that our house is very small and we have a few square kilometers of property, a full garden, and some animals, making the outside chores more than twice the work of the inside chores.

When I confronted Erica about it, she said it’s because the heat makes her ‘dizzy’ and she’ll throw up in the summer humidity around. She isn’t diagnosed with any diseases but she says she’s prone to heat exhaustion so there’s no way she can do outside chores, which is bullshit, she can just do them early or late in the day when it’s not so hot.

My son, on the other hand, said he doesn’t mind at all the change. He doesn’t like cleaning the bathroom and such things and seems to think this is fair, and he said his sister will owe him future favors of some sort. I don’t think this is fair, as now my son has less free time than my daughter.

I forced them to switch back and now both them are angry with me and secretly (or they think it’s secret but I’ve noticed it anyway) switching back and continuing their first arrangement. AITA for wanting it to be fair?",False,False

1,"AITA for acknowledging when someone doesn't like a gift? | Recently I went on a trip to Vegas and bought people some small, miscellaneous gifts I thought they might like. I got my eldest daughter (28) and her step-daughter (12) water bottles with gel beads to keep their drinks cool, my youngest daughter (18) a unicorn night light, and my son (20) a joke box-old practical jokes like fake vomit and buzzers. Now, one thing that may be worth mentioning is that my son has Asperger's. And for this, all that means is that it's very easy to tell when he doesn't like something because it's very easy to tell when he does. When he likes it, he is very noticeably excited and extremely grateful. When he doesn't, he's calm and mostly indifferent-though very polite.

He didn't like the joke box, I knew immediately despite the fact he said thank you and accepted it. So I acknowledged that he didn't like it, and apologized for getting him a gift he didn't enjoy. He responded by assuring me he did like it and thanking me again, because, like I said, he's polite. Later my youngest told me she never liked that I did that, and when I pressed she said it was unpleasant when I acknowledged a gift was unwanted. She said it makes the receiver feel guilty and is a quick way to get double gratitude on a present. I told her she had it all wrong, and was overreacting. She agreed, but in a bitter way, and said I should forget about it. But I haven't.

1,"AITA for wanting to be the “other woman”? | Throw away bc my best friend knows my actual account. 

Basically I (F19) started college and met Max (fake name, M19) and we both really hit it off. We became really good friends as he has a girlfriend at another school.

Max and I have been talking a lot these past few months and we’re really close now. A few days ago, he told me that his girlfriends is very controlling and in the three years they’ve dated, he has cheated on her more than he’d like to admit. He claims that he doesn’t love her, but he’s too scared to end it with her because she’s apparently crazy. He’s been hoping that she’ll find out about these “other women” and end things herself. 

I basically told him that I’d be willing to basically be his fake girlfriend until she hopefully notices what’s going on and breaks up with him.

Issue: I expressed to to my husband that I'd like to walk at my graduation ceremony next year. He basically said this was silly because 1) it's a master's and you've already walked for your undergrad 2) it's an online program. Not gonna lie...I'm more hurt than pissed, said as much and I don't think he cares since he's downstairs playing a computer game. My thoughts are that this is a big deal to me because I've worked hard and juggle several things each day while he primarily goes to work and then back home. I also think it would be good for our kids to see because they see me studying and know that we're not taking trips this year due to my school schedule.

1,"AITA for adopting a dog with the same name as my daughter? | My wife and I have two kids, Kristopher (9) and Sadie (12). For Kris' birthday last Friday, my wife and I decided to get him a dog, which he has been asking for since he could talk and we feel he's finally responsible enough to walk/feed a dog himself.

My wife and I decided to adopt an older dog, not a puppy, and a medium sized dog, and preferably a girl dog because I've heard they have better temperaments. Other than that, it was up to me to pick one at the Humane Society and when I got there, I immediately fell in love with a sweet 30lb Pit mix with beautiful green eyes. When I saw her name was Sadie like our daughter, I thought it was a sign that she belonged with our family. My wife thought the coincidence was funny when I told her, too, which is important.

So I arranged the adoption and the shelter agreed we'd pick her up last Friday after a birthday dinner for Kris. I pretended we were stopping at another place in the plaza and went inside and came out with (dog) Sadie. BOTH kids were thrilled but Kris was the happiest I'd ever seen him, and everything was perfect until I told them her name. My daughter Sadie instantly said it was super embarrassing to have the same name as the dog and IMMEDIATELY insisted that Kris change Sadie's name. She kept trying to make him promise but she was already spoiling the birthday gift before we even left the parking lot so I told her we'd talk about it later.

Well, this week has been hellish. Kris is insistent we keep Sadie's name because she's 4 years old and has had that name her whole life. He says you wouldn't rename a 4 year old person and I think he has a point. I also think it's cute and funny that they have the same name. My daughter for some reason is mortified by this and won't even interact with me, her brother, or the dog. My wife, who thought it was cute at first, now says she sees Sadie's point and thinks we need to change the dog's name. I put my foot down because this is Kris' birthday present and his choice.

So to make the long story short.

0,"AITA for joking about my phobia? | I have pretty bad emetophobia (fear of vomit/vomiting) - it's not bad enough to stop me from going outside or anything, but it makes me extremely anxious in situations that I know I couldn't escape if someone throws up, such as on public transit or in a car or something. If someone says they have a stomachache, I will immediately panic and start giving them distance. I can't listen to any graphic vomiting stories at all as they just stress me out and make me feel miserable. I know it's not reasonable, but I've seen therapists about it and I'm trying to make things better.

Anyways, yesterday my friend had some sort of stomach bug, and threw up a couple times. She texted the group chat about it, we all wished her well, etc. Today she was at school but still feeling a bit ill. On our walk home, she mentioned to us that she wasn't feeling that well, and we started telling her to stay home the next day if she still felt bad. I made a joke along the lines of, ""I'd have to avoid you anyways"", because if she got worse tomorrow I really would not be able to be near her without panicking. I realize that the joke was not in the best taste, but she knows about my phobia (I saw a girl vomiting when I was with her, literally sprinted away to get out of the situation, and was shaky for a while afterwards) and figured it wouldn't be that big of a deal. She didn't say anything about it and seemed fine for the rest of the time.

Later on I got a text from her that said ""why were you worried I'd throw up on you lmao"", to which I replied that I have a phobia, which she knows. She said that she would avoid me if she felt worse tomorrow, and then added ""not like how I feel matters that much lmao"". I immediately felt terrible and apologized - I would never, ever want to make someone feel shitty for this. My behavior can be bad in stressful situations but that doesn't mean I get a free pass to act like a jerk. She hasn't replied and she usually texts back quickly, so I think she's ignoring me.

1,"AITA for not liking my stepdaughter? | First and foremost, I’ll never do anything to harm her. She’s a child, she’s going into 4th grade and wouldn’t harm a fly. She’s a sweetheart, and right now her father and I have been taking her on daytrips because she won’t be an only child soon as I am pregnant. Here’s the problem: I don’t like her that much. I can’t shake this dislike that I know is linked because she’s not my daughter (long story, I married my high school crush but he had a previous marriage, had said stepdaughter, etc) and I feel awful for it. No amount of therapy has helped and I’d never tell him I don’t like his daughter because that’s absurd.

I had made a post about this previously but I wasn’t pregnant then, now I’ve begun to overthink it. Kids can tell when you hate them and I’m worried she can tell that I don’t really love her and I’m afraid I never will. I feel like an asshole for it even though I can’t change these feelings.

1,"AITA for leaving a date with a really nice guy because I ran into an old flame (maybe THE old flame) or is all fair I love and war? | Ever have one of those day's where your life has been comfortably regular and then all of the sudden you wake up and everything is pure chaos and it's terrifying and wonderful at the same time? That's where I'm at right now. 

I could go on dramatically and bore everyone so I will try and keep this simple. Three years ago I broke up with a guy who literally checked every box I have because he was in the Navy and moving and I felt like I owed to myself to finish grad school. I decided that if I kept in touch with him in any way I would drop everything and willingly become a happy housewife so I changed my number, deleted all social media and got on with the business of getting over him. Call him Charlie. 


Fast forward to last week, I work in a large office complex and evert single day this very sweet, cute guy walks past our front door and we wave. We've chatted a few times so I know his name. On Wednesday he very nervously asked me out and he was just so nice and earnest and sweetly awkard that I said yes. 


We went out last night and I was having a nice time but was like MAYBE there's possibility here but I liked him as a person. I went to the bathroom and ran smack into Charlie's parents. They always loved me and when they said that Charlie had just moved back into town for his next assignment, my knee's literally got weak. His mom asked for my number and without even thinking I gave it to her. I said goodbye and rejoined my date. 


It wasn't even 15 minutes and Charlie texted me ""is this really you?"" I texted back ""yes"" and then he asked where I was. I told him I was at a restaurant and he asked if he could come pick me up. Again without even thinking I said yes. I told my date that I was having a family emergency and that was the reason for the texts. He offered to give me a ride home. I told him that it was ok and my brother was coming to pick me up. I said I was so sorry and I paid for our entire meal but he insisted on waiting with me out front. When Charlie pulled up and it was the first time I'd seen him in 3 years I again got weak in the knees. I told my date that he was my brother but I could absolutely tell by the look in his eyes he knew I was lying but he was way too nice of a guy to call me out on my bullshit. 


Of course it was instant chemistry with Charlie and after playing an hour of catch up we were back at my house doing what we did best. Only he's such an amazing such an amazing guy he said he wanted to slow down a bit and not take it all the way, instead he tucked me in and left with a kiss on the forehead. He's on his way over now to take me to a champagne brunch. I'm ready to drive to vegas and get married and never say goodbye to him again.  


But enough of the school girl gushing and back to the problem. I feel AWFUL for what I did to my date last night. I don't know what to do or say to him and I know I'm going to see him tomorrow. I guess to help me know how to plan for tomorrow, I guess finding out if I am a light asshole, a major asshole or even some small chance NTA would be very helpful. 

so AITA?

0,"WIBTA if I go postal on my neighbor over Girl Scout cookies? | Quick background: Husband, toddler and I recently moved to a very WASPY suburb. We live in a neighborhood that is essentially an enlarged cul-de-sac. So when the weather is decent, we will come into contact with our neighbors a lot.

Now, to the not-so-quick WIBTA issue at hand.

A neighbor (who I have yet to meet in person) sends out an email in early January on behalf of her Girl Scout daughter, letting neighborhood email distribution (yeah, I know) know that daughter is selling cookies and if we want to order them, reply to email and ChasePay her money. I reply with some pleasantries (""new to hood, hope to meet you soon!"") plus my order of many boxes of Thin Mints and others. Sidenote: I LOVE GIRL SCOUT COOKIES. I look forward to them every year. I need them to get me through the misery of February in the Midwest.

Neighbor never acknowledges payment or order. I email her days later to confirm. She responds days later, apologizing. A month + goes by. I start seeing those delightful colorful boxes around my office. This past Thursday, she sends a neighborhood-wide email that daughter will be at X grocery with cookies for sale, in case anyone missed the original order opp. I respond asking when the pre-ordered cookies will be available. No response. Two days later, Saturday, she responds that they already picked them up. Period. End of email. Nothing about delivery or pick-up, or how the fuck I can obtain my cookies.

I respond right away asking if they'll be delivering them or what. She responds days later (Monday AM) that she's super busy at work and can maybe drop them off this coming Sunday (over a week after they've received the cookie shipment), or she'll put on her front stoop and I can pick them up any time. Great, I respond, I will pick them up right away. No response. I go to her house that evening and there are no cookies on the stoop. WTF. I don't want to be totally psycho and ring her doorbell, so I leave and send a follow up email. This was Monday PM. SHE STILL HASN'T RESPONDED. I sent another one this AM...nothing.

Now I'm sure many of you are thinking I'm overreacting about these cookies. Maybe neighbor lady has something serious going on. Etc. Fair points. But the communication around what is supposed to be a fun and light-hearted thing (Girl Scout cookies) -- which, by the way, her daughter (the Girl Scout) has had nothing to do with, even though I'm pretty sure the cookie selling is supposed to empower the child's entrepreneurial skills or some shit -- has been infuriating to me. AND I NEED THOSE THIN MINTS. And I paid for them already. WIBTA if I showed up at her house demanding my cookies??

TL;DR: I'm obsessed with Girl Scout cookies. Ordered and paid for many boxes through new neighbor child's mother. Bizarro lady is stonewalling me and ignoring my polite and friendly requests to pick up what is rightfully mine. WIBTA if I show up at her door unannounced?",False,False
0,"AITA for not forgiving my wife straight away after an argument? | Complex issue, but simply she has anger issues, loses control and packs bags to leave, nothing will help in calming her down, I need to rise above the high emotions to keep things together, and then there is the conciliation. This has happened dozens of times over the years.

I'm not blameless and admit my shortcomings and apologise. She does so after making lots of damaging comments. She ended up finally seeking help and was prescribed some meds. These were surprisingly effective and this was great. More calm, considered, and controlled. All of a sudden small things were a 5 minute chat rather than a balls-out fight. Promises were made, new leafs turned, etc.

She then forgot to take them, lost control of her emotions, and there was another argument about a minor difference in opinion that resulted in a 2 day fight. We spoke about the meds in the wash-up and the need to not forget taking them. Well it happened, again, after she *forgot to take them for a week*.

So now she's ready to make things better after 2 days of being very nasty, knowing the effect it has on me, knowing the importance and effectiveness of her meds, and knowing the repercussions of all of this. I'm cold about it all and am not ready to resume normal relations. I've made the decision to be on the couch for the foreseeable future. I'm ambivalent about all of this now. It's not hard to take a tablet. Sure, you can forget a day but not a week. You can do it once, but not twice. You can have bad days but more routinely threaten divorce over minutia of life that can be tackled together rather than through the lens of conflict.

0,"WIBTA if I don't tip my tattoo artist? | So, 15 years ago, I got a tattoo. A simple shape (think something like a leaf), 1.5 inches in diameter, black outline, filled w/a solid color. The original ""artist"" took it upon himself to add white ""highlights"" that were, I think, meant to make it look 3-D. It just looked like the color was missing in spots. I couldn't see the area during the process. It cost $70. The place shut down soon after. I figured it was my fault for not doing research, and considered it a learning experience.

I recently decided to get it ""fixed."" Found a place with good reviews. Called, said I was hoping they could touch it up AND do something to make it look nicer. Asked to talk to the tattoo artist in person about possibilities.

When we met he said ""so, what are we outlining?"" I repeated what I said over the phone. Was about to mention adding to it when he interrupted with ""uh huh, gimme a few minutes."" I was put off, as there still wasn't a game plan. But he had good reviews and I already paid the deposit so, while waiting, I googled ideas. Settled on shading that would start black at the outline, and fade as it moved into the center of the shape. I hoped, since it was black over white and meant to look faded anyways, that it would blend well.

He came back, I showed him the example. He said no problem, and yes, it would blend in very well.

He communicated step by step. ""Just finished going over the outline, now I'm doing the shading,"" etc. It took 30 minutes. Nothing he said made me question what he was doing so I was **horrified** when I saw that he'd added solid black lines in the middle of the shape, with no shading from the outline into the center. It's a terrible look for this particular shape.

There's a $100 minimum which is the same as the deposit so the artist said ""let's just call it $100."" However, I've been told that you should tip good tattoo artists. It DOES cover up the white, it's just not what I asked for. There's no way to ""fix it"" now without making it all black or getting an entirely new piece over it. I didn't want to make a scene so I just said it looked good.

Here's where the potential assholery comes in. 

I'd given the receptionist my card# over the phone for the deposit. I went to the front to ask if I could add a tip when she ran my card. She said they were cash only, which I didn't expect, since they had to run my card anyways for the $100. She also didn't mention this when I made the appointment, so I had no way of knowing. I just wanted to get out of there, so I asked if I could bring cash later, she said yes.

I'm now the common denominator in two very negative experiences, and feel like this indicates that **I'm** the one who's not communicating what I want very well. However, I'm not sure how I could've described it better, or what I could've done differently, and I'm *very* unhappy with the new tattoo, more than the original.

Would I be the asshole if I just didn't go back with a tip?",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting to resume 'platonic' contact with a dude I met on a dating site 3 years ago now I'm married? | Throwaway account just in case. Sorry if I don't format correctly etc. Background: I was on a dating site for about 2 years from late 2014 until Oct 2016. I didn't meet a lot of people, several creeps, a few non starters, but October of 2016 I met my now husband and we have been married for 2 years last November. 

Some time mid 2016 I started chatting to a guy (let's call him Tom) on the site, it was friendly but a bit lacklustre- he would only get back to me once every week or two, and he lived in a different state. We never spoke on the phone, I once mentioned that I have an art website he should check out some time. I didnt feel like he seemed super keen and I was in it to actually find a partner, so I just let it fizzle. Realistically, I guess I stopped replying, but don't honestly remember now. And around that time I met my now husband on the same site, so I think I ghosted Tom, felt a bit bad but not too bad, and discontinued my membership completely by the end of that year.

Tonight, I receive a phone call from a number I'm not familiar with, and I answer it to hear a stranger introduce himself. He tells me that his name is Tom, he knows me from the dating website, and says 'we seem to have lost touch', and that he found my mobile number on my art website that I told him to look at in 2016. I responded with something like 'Tom? I can't remember a Tom?' (The truth! It was a handful of emails 3.5 years ago) and 'um, I'm really sorry but I'm married now.' He kept going with how he'd like to resume contact, and about how he had got my number. I am on the other end both assuming that he wants to pick up where we left off and feeling creeped out that this guy is calling my phone after more than 3 years of no contact and not actually having been given my number. I remind him again that I am married now, apologize again and say good bye. End convo, my husband and I laugh about it and move on. 

30 min later I receive a lengthy message from Tom, simultaneously rebuking me for how rude I just was on the phone (""I was very offended at how you treated me before"", ""I always assumed you got married, you seemed to always want to"", ""please dont reply and be as rude as you were before"" and,"" males and females can be just friends you know"") and asking me how I'm going, telling me how he is etc. I guess I was rude in retrospect, but I don't know this dude and why would he call me out of the blue after three years on a number he had to dig up from internet past?

Against my normal nature, instead of replying and apologising for hurting his feelings, and chatting to him like I used to, I blocked his number. So AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for advising my wife to wear less revealing clothing when my son’s friends are over? | My wife is 48, we have been married for nearly 20 years. We have a 18 year old son, as well as 4 younger kids.

Our son is in his last year of high school. He is a very popular guy and has many friends. His friends often come over to hang out and occasionally to sleep over. Our house is large so they like coming here. 

Last year, my son’s best friend Tom (also 18) came with us on a family vacation at our beach house. During that time I noticed that he would always be staring at my wife and checking her out. Once, he walked in on her changing in a bathroom, and claimed that he “didnt know it was occupied”. He would also say borderline inappropriate comments like “you look lovely today” and “you have to tell me your workout routine”. For this reason I am a bit wary of Tom, in particular.

On Saturday, my son and his 4 friends,including Tom, were over at our house for a sleepover. In the morning, my wife made them breakfast. She was wearing only a silk camisole and shorts. I walked in and noticed that many of the guys were not so subtly “checking her out”. Don’t get me wrong, my wife looks amazing for her age, but it just seemed uncomfortable and awkward for her to be dressed like that in front of her son’s friends.

After breakfast, I mentioned this to her, and told her that she should consider wearing something less revealing next time, or simply just get dressed in her everyday clothes. She said its “no big deal” and that I’m being too overbearing, that “they’re just kids”. I said they’re not just kids, they’re young men, and I’m just looking out for her. Besides, I told her that our son would no doubt agree with me, that he’d prefer it if his friends didn’t check out his mother.

0,"AITA for not wanting to go to a wedding I wasn't invited to in the first place | So my uncle's longtime gf's daughter wedding is coming up and I had no idea about it. Basically all of my family is invited to it except for me. I have legit no idea why the daughter has a problem with me. She's been apart of our family for like 6 years or something like that. Her and I never really interacted but you can tell when someone doesn't like you, right?

Anyways, today I messaged my uncle asking him what he would like to do for our birthday and he told me it would have to be after the wedding. Me having no idea what he was talking abiut responded accordingly and he sort of got mad that I didn't know what he was talking about. We go back and forth a little bit. Nothing bad I basically tell him ""you don't have to invite me cause I don't want to crash a wedding I'm not welcomed at in the first place and ruin the day"" and he gets mad at me and say it was unnecessary for me to say that cause we're family.

1,"AITA for not letting my wife take my last name? | We are recently engaged and my fiancée referred to herself as the ""future Mrs Iron."" 

I don't want her to take my last name and told her as much. I think people should keep the names they're given as it's an important connection to their family. My mother didn't change her last name when she married my father, which I think is right. She was born ""Smith,"" she wasn't born with the last name ""Iron."" Family and connections are important to me and I don't think my fiancée should give up her ties to her family just because the two of us are getting married. 

My fiancée wants us to share this name as a family and says that she's not sure she can be with someone who won't share their last name. She thinks I'm being selfish, snobby, and elitist. She's accusing me of not thinking she's ""good enough"" for the family name.

1,"AITA for underpaying my teenage tutor? | Needed a tutor for for my kid this summer. 

Live near a college. Asked a professor friend to recommend a student.

He put me in contact with a girl (this becomes relevant). I interviewed her. She seemed great. She asked what the gig paid. 

I had read that tutors cost around $30-40 an hour minimum, so figured I’d start with a low number and see what she came back with. 

I said “$15 an hour plus whatever you want from the fridge.” She said she’d take the job. Great. I know I would’ve been thrilled to have a $15 an hour job at 19 years old. 

My friends and my wife think I’m taking advantage of a naive kid by paying her less than the typical wages for a tutor. 

I think she didn’t have to take the job and could’ve asked for more. If she can find a higher paying job elsewhere, nothing is stopping her from taking it.

0,"AITA for being upset about a mom forbidding everyone at the party from eating my cake? | So my boyfriend, our two roommates (K and M), and I were invited to a ""house party/chill session"" and asked to bring a cake for our potluck duty. M ended up not going because she had to work. My bf and K are incredible cooks but will bake a cake so disgusting, they should get arrested. So I ended up baking alone and I didn't mind this. I love baking. I spent 6 hours on this vanilla cake with alcoholic whipped cream (with Likör 43) and shit loads of chopped strawberries. It tasted awesome. I am eating the parts I trimmed off of the cake right now with leftover cream and strawberries.

So when we got to the party, we realized that a friend of the host had brought her 2-year-old along. I was already disappointed because you know, I was promised a relatively tamed house party but still an adult party (we're all in our 20s). Yeah whatever, cake time. I cut the cake into cute pieces in the kitchen and K distributed it to everyone in the living room. She knew there was alcohol in it and so did the host and my boyfriend and everyone actually because I introduced the cake as strawberry cake with Likör 43 cream. After I was done, I walked out and noticed the kid has a piece too so I screamed, ""Noooooo the kid can't have the cake there's alcohol in it!!!!"" The mom freaked out. My boyfriend gave me shit for not realizing it earlier. I apologized and apologized. I was genuinely worried. The mom took the cake away and the kid bawled her eyes out and the host tried to calm her down with chocolate pudding. It didn't work because everyone else was eating my cake. So the mom told the kid that everyone would also stop eating and somehow everyone stopped and was comforting the kid. The mom then yelled at me for baking an alcoholic cake and not telling anyone about it and I was like wtf I did??? The host then said we could continue with the cake after the mom and kid leave and the mom said they would in a bit. The ended up staying until 10 and the kid was super obnoxious the entire time, super high on sugar because as dinner, she was allowed to have gummy bear with fanta, because the evil lady baked a cake with poison...

Now we just came home from the party and I'm still pretty upset because by the time we got to eat the cake, the whipped cream had already melted. :( I was just telling M about what happened with my boyfriend there with me. K went to bed early so she didn't contribute to the conversation. But K and my boyfriend said I overreacted when I said I was really upset because bitch I wanted everyone to enjoy my cake. I'm still super upset but my boyfriend and K said I shouldn't be because that's childish and because I shouldn't have baked the cake and the whole situation wasn't that bad.

0,"WIBTA if I don’t want to talk to my coworker’s adopted child? | I have a new coworker that shares the same manager as me. She is about ten years older than me and seems pretty nice. I don’t know her very well and I don’t really go out of my way to interact with her. That’s why I was surprised to get an email from her asking if I’d be okay talking to her adopted daughter about being an adoptee from my country of origin (same as her daughter).

For context, my manager knows I’m adopted because he is the same ethnicity as me and when I was interviewing, he asked if I was from the same country as him, and I explained I was but I was adopted. I didn’t go into depth about it and it wasn’t brought up again. Apparently when he was talking to the new coworker, he casually let it drop I too am an adoptee from the same country as her daughter. This led to her emailing me.

The problem is, I don’t like to talk about my adoption. I was an older adoptee who was abused by my birth family and I do not want to talk about it with anyone outside of my therapist. I also don’t want to explain my adoption story/explain why I am not a good candidate to idk, act as a mentor to another adoptee. I have been asked to try before and it has only hurt me/made me backslide emotionally.

I don’t want to explain this to my coworker or go in depth into why I would be a bad candidate for this. I just want to say “sorry, no thanks” and move on.

0,"WIBTA if I banned my roommate from using my kitchen appliances? | Throwaway cause idk if they use Reddit or not but basically, one of my roommates (roommate A) is extremely messy.

Me and roommate B clean our dishes as we use them but roommate A leaves them in the sink (and sometimes leaves trash in there too?) for days until eventually either me or B get sick of it and clean everything.

My main issue is that I have food allergies and roommate A’s lack of cleaning means that she’ll cook something I’m allergic too and then leave the appliance (a toaster oven, for example) dirty, meaning I have to clean it before I can even use it or else I’ll get sick.

Myself and roommate B have both repeatedly brought up cleaning as you go but nothing changes.

1,"WIBTA for not firing an impersonating teacher or involving police? | I work in a private highschool in southern Ontario. Seven years ago the administration and I decided to hire a new teacher, Amanda (name changed). Amanda had great credentials, had degrees in both math and chemistry, and as we soon found out was an excellent teacher.

Two months ago I found out she is not who she says she is. I'm part of a Facebook group to help people locally with things for free. You post something you have you don't want anymore, someone else comments they want it, you meet up and give it to them. I've been a part of this group for a few months now and I found Amanda, but under a different name. I have Amanda on Facebook, and this other account used the same photos, just a different name. My best guess is Amanda had a profile connected to her teaching life, and one being her real account.

It took me a couple of days to message her and ask her what's going on. She was straightforward with me: her friend is Amanda who had all the credentials and education, and she let ""Amanda"" apply to jobs using them. ""Amanda"" went to school, too, but not as prestigious a school, and did not graduate. The real Amanda works for some company in another city. So she colluded with her friend to apply for teaching jobs using Amanda's CV and then ""Amanda"" shows up and does the job.

""Amanda"" is a great teacher. The kids love her and she does her job well. She's also a great person. You don't *need* to be accredited to teach in a private school here. You could hire someone straight out of highschool, it's all based on ability/merit. I told ""Amanda"" I'd have to think about it and I think now my decision is to take inaction.

I don't dare tell anyone else, even ask their opinions, because this would put her job at risk. Not only that, but get police involved for fraud/identity theft. That last part has me conflicted because what she has done is unethical and illegal. She gained her position on false pretenses. I wonder to myself at night if I'm wrong for doing nothing and allowing it to happen: someone more deserving and capable could be working this job, I'm putting my neck on the line for admittedly a friend now.

1,"AITA For having bikini pictures of other girls in my phone | So I'm in a semi-long distance relationship. I see my GF about every weekend, but never during the week. Sometimes when I see girls I know on instagram post risqué pictures I screenshot them and masturbate to them later on, usually before bed. Of course when I visit my GF I delete these pictures.

Well while I was sleeping my gf went through my phone and found them in the ""recently deleted"" folder. There was no nude pictures and no pictures sent directly to me, just pictures from instagram. I am in no way in contact with any of these girls despite the chance encounter I see them since we have mutual friends.

I'm upset that my gf went through my phone, and she's very upset about the pictures. She says I should ""have nothing to hide in a relationship"" and ""if you have nothing to hide why does it matter if I go through your phone.""

I'm upset because as long as I'm not cheating I think I should be entitled to some privacy in some aspects of my life, as long as what I'm doing doesn't hurt anyone. And it wouldn't hurt anyone if my gf wouldn't go through my phone.

Basically my friend went to a party, and he didn’t have a ride home so he called me to pick him up late at night. I didn’t have a problem with that, but when I came to the house he had four other guys with him. I immediately felt uncomfortable. My friend, who’s somewhat drunk, ask me to give his other friends, dudes I’ve never even meet before a ride. I said no because I felt off about the whole thing, I didn’t trust these random ass dudes getting in my car, and with me being the only female and my only friend drunk as shit it was an automatic no for me. I offered to just give my friend a ride and the other dudes would have to find their own way, but my friend got made at me because I wouldn’t give his friends a ride. I eventually drove off after repeatedly telling him no.

The next day my friend said he was upset with me because I didn’t give him a ride, and left him. I feel bad because I left him trying to figure out a way home, all because of a feeling I got. To make something clear I wouldn’t have minded if he had one random guy with him, but four guys, that are his friends, I’ve never met before is just a no.",False,False

It was big but they had a lot of ""going out of business"" signs. There were puppies there and the store manager said that a few of the dogs would be ""destroyed"" when they eventually leave for a multitude of reasons. It was probably a combination of the mimosas we had earlier + the cuteness of the puppies but I ultimately agreed to buy one of the dogs because I couldn't stand the thought of it being put down. 

When my husband got home later that night he was furious that I had spent so much on a new puppy without telling him. He told me I was probably duped by that store and I don't disagree, but I also believe I did the right thing bringing that puppy away from that horrid store. He is mad that I did all this without asking him and I did apologize but I feel like he should cut me some slack. I only acted out of compassion and was just a bit overwhelmed by what that store manager was telling me. And besides, getting a cute puppy is hardly the worst thing to happen to anyone.

1,"AITA for being angry at my boyfriend for claiming to be Italian? | My boyfriend claims he's Italian. He takes pride in his Italian family, he cooks *a lot* of Italian meals (which are great BTW), hangs out with lots of Italians, etc. But he's not. He's faking it.

His mother was in the foster system as a baby and was adopted by an Italian family. By his account, *turbo*\-Italian. They had a small statue of Pope Benedict in their front foyer to give an idea. She was raised ""the Italian way"", even spent a lot of time in Italy. She grew up bilingual in English and Italian. Basically from as far as she can recall, she was raised in an Italian household. 

As things would be, my boyfriend was also raised in this type of household because his mother was. His father I don't know much about but he wasn't Italian. It didn't help that he grew up in a predominantly Italian neighborhood. His schoolboard curriculum even had mandatory Italian until grade 8.

But it bugs me when my boyfriend claims he's Italian and appropriates their culture when he doesn't have an Italian drop of blood in him. He's saying he's one culture when he's not. He beats around the bush when I complain: he says things like ""I'm not by blood Italian but I was raised Italian"". To clarify, he doesn't act stereotypical caricaturized Italian or anything like that, he also doesn't go super overboard, but when we hang out with friends and our upbringings come up, he's quick to say he's Italian, etc.

Just because you can cook Italian and speak it to an extent doesn't make you Italian is my thought process. AITA?

0,"AITA for not supporting my parents decision to adopt a child | I don't have a great relationship with my parents, but it's... okay. We talk to each other on holidays and birthdays. I had my first child a little over a year ago; their first grandchild. I thought this would bring us closer, since I hear grandparents like to spoil their grandkids. My MIL does this well. But, a few months after my daughter's birth, my mom (61f) texts me and says she is moving to the Philippines to adopt a baby. Reasoning: She's always wanted to adopt a baby. This is true. I remember my parents trying to adopt here in US (about 20 years ago), but they were deemed unqualified. Anyways, I thought she was joking, but 2 weeks later, my mom was on a flight to the Philippines. 

My mother buys a condo in PI and begins fostering a baby girl (we'll call her Emily) who's a few months younger than my own. My father is supportive of the idea. He is living here in the US and sends money to my mom for financial support. My younger sister is also supportive of the adoption. I am not. I had an abusive childhood, but according to my younger sister, their attitudes have changed since the time they raised me.

Fast forwarding to now: my parents were denied adoption rights because they are too old, but my mom is still caring for Emily until she's placed into new guardianship, which my mom estimates another year or so. 

Today, my dad called me and said ""Hey, I didn't get any gifts for \[your daughter\], but you'll get bonus points if you send Emily some money for Christmas. $100 will go a long way."" I told him I don't plan on sending any money right now, nor do I care for his bonus points. 

I know it's the time of giving, but I was a bit heated when he said he wasn't going to be giving a gift to his grandchild and then asking for money. Now, I feel guilt and jealousy. I want Emily to have a wonderful life and my parents (maybe) want a do-over when it comes to parenting, but I also want my daughter to get more love from her grandparents. AITA?

**Tldr:** I didn't have a great childhood. Gave my parents their first grandchild hoping this bundle of joy will bring us closer, but they aren't acting how I was hoping they'd react.

My boyfriend works 330am-1130am on a normal day and I work 830am-4pm (but don’t NEED to be at work until 10 as the first hour or so is considered “administrative time”) I suggest that my boyfriend take one day off and I’ll find coverage to take whatever day he doesn’t. He is very adamant that he cannot take any time off bc they’re very busy and are working mandatory 10 hour days for the next 2 weeks, so essentially I’m on my own. My boss was kind enough to let me take our daughter to work with me BOTH Thursday and Friday but she wasn’t happy about it. So fast forward to Saturday evening and our sitter cancels on us Monday AND Tuesday. So here we are again, I ask him to please take a half day Monday or Tuesday bc I can’t take her to work 4 days in a row and if he takes a half day he gets home by 830am and then I can be to work by 9-930. Absolutely refuses. Nope! He can’t do it bc “10 hOuR dAYs MaNdAToRY fOr TwO wEeKs.” So I bite the bullet and I work for someone else on Sunday so they can work for me Monday and I switched with someone so I could have Tuesday off and now I’m working Saturday (today) Now it’s Wednesday and my boyfriend decides he’s going to leave work at his normal time bc he has a tattoo appointment (so he doesn’t work the mandatory 10 hours)  and then comes Friday.. the real kicker. I text him as soon as I wake up to let him know our taxes have come (we split them in half bc we file separately) and this mother fucker tells me “I’m gonna take a half day today. Can I meet you at the bank and we’ll split the money and have lunch?” 
So I stewed on that for awhile and come lunch time I go off. Tell him he’s selfish. He can’t take a half day to watch our kid and let me go to work so I don’t have to work weekends but you can leave early for a tattoo and some fucking tax money?

0,"AITA for “forcing” a gluten free diet on my family? | I have celiac disease, which means I can’t eat gluten. My family doesn’t have celiac so they still eat gluten. I do get frustrated with them sometimes, because they’re very careless and often leave crumbs everywhere or use my pots and pans (I have separate ones to avoid cross contamination). I’ve never asked them to stop eating gluten though. The only thing I ask is that they don’t use wheat flour, since it gets EVERYWHERE and can stay in the air for hours and hours after using it, which I can get sick from if I breathe it in (it has happened multiple times before). Of course they don’t really listen though.

Anyway, my dads birthday was the other day. He asked if I could make him a cake, so I did. But, of course, it was gluten free. I love my dad but I’m not going to make myself sick by baking with wheat flour, it’s not worth it. They can be kind of weird about gluten free stuff, acting like it’s poison or something. Sometimes if they know something is gluten free, they’ll instantly act like they don’t like it, or try it and say that it’s gross. Which is why I don’t really cook/bake for them anymore. My dad is the only one who doesn’t act like that, so that’s the only reason I even tried making a cake. 

Because of this, I didn’t tell my family the cake was gluten free. They all ate it and loved it, didn’t say anything about it being gross. Later that night my mom found the package for the gluten free flour in the garbage. She asked if I had used it for the cake and I said yes. She immediately told the rest of the family, and they’re all really mad at me for “forcing” my diet on them. They said they thought I had grown up by now, and wasn’t doing that anymore. I find this very irritating, especially since only my parents ate the cake! Obviously we can’t have a party right now, so this was just something for the three of us. But now everyone is angry because I hypothetically gave them gluten free food?? The only person who’s taking my side is my dad. AITA for not telling them it was gluten free?",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting my mother-in-law to live with us after my wife gives birth? | I am 35, my wife is 32. We have been married for 11 years and have 2 daughters, 10 and 6. She is currently 4 months pregnant with twins.

I am an engineer for a hydro company and work 8-4 each day, 40 hours a week and sometimes overtime. My wife works full time as a nurse consultant for a pharmaceutical company.

But otherwise she takes care of the house, the kids, and also does the cooking. I tell her she’s doing a LOT of work for someone who is pregnant with twins, and suggested that she take maternity leave early (she originally planned to leave around 7 months). I also suggested that she should think about staying home with the kids and maybe working from home after the birth of our twins. 

She felt insulted by my suggestion and said she wouldn’t feel right, not working and just staying at home. I told her I earned enough for both of us and she should just take it easy. She was originally planning on having her mother come and take care of the kids and babies while she went back to work after a month or so. She told me that her mom is planning on staying “indefinitely” and “thats how its done in my family”. I know that after her mother gave birth to her sister, her grandparents literally moved in with them for 10 years, helping to raise the both of them while her parents worked.

I’m not okay with this idea because although I like my MIL (57), I wouldnt feel comfortable having her live with us, especially for an indefinite length of time. I also don’t like the idea of my wife continuing to work while pregnant. I don’t want her to go back to work as soon as she gives birth. I just want her to be there for the kids.

I don’t want an outsider interrupting our daily lives. She helped us out for a few months after the birth of our youngest, and there was some tension after a while. But my MIL wants my wife to go back to work ASAP after having kids. I really don’t understand the rush and just want my wife to be taking care of our children. 

I told my wife this and she said I’m being rude and unreasonable for not wanting her mom to live with us. And that with 4 kids, she needs extra help. I volunteered to take paternity leave for a month or so and she said thats a “dumb idea”.

1,"AITA for yelling at my sister to shut the fuck up with her moaning and whining after her surgery? | My sister (20F) got breast implant surgery on Friday. She has been a pain in the ass ever since. My parents and I (18F) are taking care of her. Mostly me though. She has a fever right now and is constantly moaning and whining very loudly, obviously trying to get our attention. She’s a lovely person when healthy, but when we were kids, she was always the annoying sick person who would always make it seem like they’re in a world of pain and dying. I thought she would have grown out of it by now, but I was wrong. 


I know she is hurting right now, but she has never once thanked me for my help. I picked her up from the clinic, put a towel under her boobs to prevent chafing from the seat belt, changed her gauze bandage to prevent an infection, and spoon fed her because she can’t lift her arms. She just kept moaning and whining through it all without once acknowledging the help she’s getting. When she called me over to help her change her clothes and underwear tonight, she just kept moaning and whining through it all. 


When I got done with it all, she didn’t thank me again. She just laid in bed and moaned some more. I yelled at her to shut the fuck up and stop annoying the shit out of everyone. She just moaned again and said she was in so much pain. Just as I was telling her that she didn’t need to make everyone else miserable just because she is, my mom came and told me not to talk to my sister like that. I asked her if she didn’t think my sister is playing up her sickness and pain, but she told me to be more compassionate.",False,False
0,"AITA for not telling this woman there was a spider making a web in her hair? | A few weeks ago, one of my best friends got married. Her wedding was outside, and it was a very strict 50 person invite limit. My friend only invited 50 people for a reason, she told everyone before hand, they could not bring an additional guest. Well this lady brought someone anyway and caused a big mess at my friends wedding. She only had enough plate settings, chairs to watch the ceremony, and food, for 50 people. 
After the ceremony was over, we all started sitting at the tables outside to enjoy the meal. As everyone was sitting down, it was obvious there were not enough seats. She wasn’t the only person to bring someone else, so people were just standing around, sharing seats, and eating with their hands. This lady sits across from me and I hear her starting to talk shit about my friend who just got married. She was saying how she couldn’t believe she didn’t plan for enough people, and it was tacky that people were having to eat with their hands, even though SHE is the one who brought an uninvited guest. Then she muttered the line “not my circus, not my monkeys. Sounds like she should have planned better” 
At this point I’m livid. My friends wedding was BEAUTIFUL, and carefully planned. I don’t say anything to this woman because I want my friends wedding to be as calm as possible. So I got on talking to my other friends and enjoying the food. 
After a few minutes I look up at this woman and just assess what she looks like so I can tell my friend afterward about how nasty she was. When I looked at her I noticed her hair was in a bun on her head and it had a little loop that was sticking out of the top of the bun. It looked like a rollercoaster loop, just on top of the bun. I noticed something move in her hair, and carefully watched the best karma unfold. A spider (not huge) walks up to this loop, jumps inside, and started spinning a web. RIGHT THERE IN THE LOOP. it took everything in me not to spit out my drink when I realized what was happening. 
So I just watched it happen. This spider went to town, it went back and forth, side to side, up and down and made a decent web in this woman’s hair. I never said anything to her, and I’m sure it probably left her hair before she got home. I just thought that karma was working itself out, and I best not be the one to get in karma’s way.

0,"AITA For how I dealt with a classmate? | I (17F) started college last September. Our class is for people with mental or physical health issues; I’m on the autism spectrum and have anxiety and depression. The issue is with one of my classmates Jake (18M.)

Jake is the only member of our class who’s been on our course for a year already. He was already our class leader. We didn’t get to vote on this, because Jake was already in the position.

The issue started when he became basically glued to my side. I go out with 3 of my friends at break, and Jake started coming too, which is fine but he has no understanding of personal space, and his arm constantly brushes against mine. Even when I sit down, he stands in front of me, so close that my knee brushes his leg. He’s a foot taller than me, so he pretty much towers over me. When I’m talking, he comes over to interrupt and talk over us and stands between me and whoever I’m talking to, while standing arm to arm with me. I started wearing my earphones to avoid talking to him, but he just started shouting my name and waving his hands under my face.

He tried to put his arm around me once during cooking class, putting it on the shelf behind me while talking to me. Another time in cooking, after eating, I was on washing up duty. Jake, who just finished and was also washing up, came over and put his dirty dishes by my sink for me to do before wandering around doing nothing.

When I was talking to one of my other friends and we were bantering, my friend said something like “I don’t want to look at you either!” Which I found funny, but Jake immediately said “Don’t be mean to OP please thanks.” He doesn’t open doors for the boys but the second I’m around he opens them ALL for me and says ladies first as I walk by. It might just be me but I find it extremely patronising. 

I finally broke down around November, telling my mum how I barely had space to breathe because Jake is constantly looming over me or trying to get my attention. She rang up and they promised to keep an eye on it. All they did was put up a few posters about personal space. Jake carried on; in cooking (again) he was cleaning the tables and started cleaning where I was sitting. He was so close our legs were touching, so I told him that my table was already clean, and he backed off. 

I’ve been putting up with Jake for almost five months now. He opened the door for me again and I made a joke of it, holding it for him instead and saying “Ladies first, Jake!” He was adamant that I had to go first and got annoyed. This was 2 weeks ago.

Last Wednesday, I was brought out of class by my tutor and confronted by her and Jake. Apparently my comment of ladies first, Jake had really upset him, and our tutor told me, in front of him, that Jake was the most polite man she knows and he’s just being a gentleman. I had to say sorry.

I feel like this was very unfair. I complained about him two months ago and nothing happened and I have to apologise for a comment made after months of stress because of him. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend's ex in our house? | Some back story. When he and I first got together up until merely a couple of months ago (two months max) she would call him begging him to take her back. They have a child, and in the past she's kept the child from him until recently, because she has no place to live. I've stayed insulted by her actions and trespasses against our relationship, my boyfriend, and even their child from keeping him away from his father.

Now the child has a routine, rules, and he knows what to expect day to day. He's very young and misses his mom all the time. My boyfriend messaged her asking her to contact him more, weeks would go by without a call or anything. When she did call, he'd wake up at night screaming, crying, or running to the front door. So he asked her to call and visit more often, which had helped him. 

But now, due to current worldwide circumstances, she doesn't really have a lot of places to take him. However, it makes me very uncomfortable having her at our house. She corners him into discussions about their previous relationship, asking him what she did wrong, etc. I'm insulted that he would allow her to go that far. 

She wants to spend time with him in our home. When my boyfriend said it wasn't okay she began to cry, which I see as a guilt trip. My boyfriend makes arguments to me about why she should be able to stay.

1,"AITA for calling the cops on a sketchy guy at the park? | Hi everyone I am a 30F with two children. I usually take them to the park on nice days so they can play at the playground. Also it’s a good chance for them to be able to hang out with their biological dads since can meet them there for awhile after work.

Anyways, today there was a creepy liking dude. It hard to describe but you know when your gut a a mother is just tugging at you? Yep! Parental instinct. Examples were he was dressed in all white with red underwear showing through his clothes (frickin weird). He had sunglasses on and kept staring at the children. He also spent a lot of time on his phone but his fingers weren’t swiping so I’m pretty sure he was videotaping.

I actually approached him politely and said “which ones yours?” But he just stared at me and ignored me. I said again “hey man are you ok?” And he said “fine. Just fucking leave me alone lady”. Wtf who says that?!

I ended up calling the police and they walked him to the police car with cuffs on. And magically, no children with him. I ended up having to leave to run to the bank before it closed so I didn’t see what happened.

AITA for reporting this sketchy guy to the cops? Even if there was a chance he wasn’t doing anything I figure that the police can be the one to review the content on his phone and make that determination if he was videoing the children. Better safe than sorry I guess. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for calling my brother a 'generic whitewashed brown boy'? | I'm \[16f\] Indian, and I have a brother \[15m\], Rohan. There's a stereotype, at least in the Indian-American community in my experience, of how a wannabe cool brown boy acts: has generic hypebeast/fuckboy style (yeezy 350s, supreme, vineyard vines, patagonia, hollister, vans), exclusively listens to trap music, goes after white girls only, makes curry jokes, does fbla/speech & debate/tennis/cross country, and wants to go to a large state school with a good business program so they can get lit but still get a good job afterwards. 

&#x200B;

As it happens to be, Rohan fits this stereotype to a tee: he dresses like a generic fuckboy, listens to Travis Scott 24/7, only talks to white girls, makes jokes about Indian culture, plays tennis, and aspires to go to UVA so he can join a frat and go to Wall Street afterwards. 

&#x200B;

As a result, I sometimes refer to him as a 'generic whitewashed brown boy', because he embodies the stereotype. But he dislikes this and calls me an asshole whenever I call him this. I don't think I'm in the wrong. If the shoe fits, right?

1,"AITA for not punishing my son (21M) for repeatedly cheating on his GF? | So I (45F) have three kids (16M, 18F and 21M) with my husband Mark (fake name). We can call them Mike, Anna and Jack (more fake names).

My eldest Jack is the most ''successful'' of our three. I don't have a favorite child of course, but I am the most proud of him. He's going to make our family proud because of what he's done. Not only is he going to graduate from an Ivy League school but he's got an internship lined up with a prestigious firm. He's extremely confident, social and also good looking so it's not a surprise he's popular with ladies. 

He hasn't been the type for relationships but he got into one with a girl we can call Danielle about 6 months ago. He hasn't brought her to the house, they mostly stay at uni together and he doesn't want her to visit. It's clear he's not taking it seriously as she seems to be way more into him than he is her. Anyway, he came to visit recently and left his phone unlocked. 

My youngest saw that and instantly checked his phone and found lots of messages/nudes sent from other girls. He's clearly cheated which is confirmed by the multiple texts to other girls. He showed Anna and then me. I took a look, and didn't like what I saw. I decided to also tell my husband and he flat out said ''Don't bother me with this shit I have more important things to do'' (which to his credit, is true. He works close to 80 hours a week. Yes we are very well financially but it's largely due to him/his connections at a prestigious firm). 

Anna and Mike were disgusted and demanded that I punish Jack. They confronted Jack and he told them to ''Fuck off''. I had a word with Jack and told him this behavior isn't good, but that's about as far as I will involve myself. I'm incredibly proud of my son for doing what he's done and told him that although I don't condone his behavior, I still love him and if he needs anything that he can always ask me. So we hugged and then I dropped him off to see his friends.

Now my other two are angry at me and Anna said that I'm condoning misogyny. I said it's not like that. I took them aside and calmly explained to them that they need to focus on their lives, because quite frankly, I don't like their career choices. Anna wants to study some sort of Sociology degree and Mike wants to become a YouTuber. I told them that they I'll take them seriously once they start taking themselves seriously like Jack and now they called me every name under the sun. Well I told my husband and now he's super pissed at them and is going to have a stern word with them. Anna is 18 so we can't punish her, but now I am considering punishing Mike for snooping on Jack's phone. They still won't talk to me, AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for asking my roommate to cover the full deposit for her and her boyfriend’s cat? | Just to clarify, I am 18F and she is 20F. We’ve lived together before and are moving for the sake of location (price is higher than where we are at currently). 

We’re looking at a place that’s around 800 a month. It’s a low-income and the reason I’ve been very keen on the place we’re supposed to be moving into is because it is two blocks away from my school and a 5-10 minute car ride to her work vs the 30 minute commute we both make right now. It is a beautiful place and we are very excited. 

To clarify, neither of our partners are going to live in the apartment. It is just the two of us and we’ve established that should either of our boyfriends move in, we’re split utilities given however many people are living there (right now 2, but if the SO’s move in either 3 or 4 ways) but keep rent 400 and 200/200 for those sharing a room.

I’ve been getting down to the splitting of costs with her over text. The place we’re moving into allows pets with $200 deposit and $20 added to rent a month. I don’t have any pets right now, and she is looking into adopting a cat with her boyfriend, who will not be moving in as of right now. I’ve told her that if she is bringing the cat in, her boyfriend and her should split the deposit and I’m willing to help cover the $20 monthly and include it in the cost of rent.

She seemed a little offput and just responded with “me and [SO] will talk about it”

Obviously I will be around the cat, but I don’t think I should pay the deposit as it’s not my cat. There are two animals allowed in the apartment and should I look into adopting an animal, I’d offer to pay the full deposit for the animal.

I have a coworker in his mid 30s who claims to suffer from chronic pain. Frankly, I think it’s a load of crap. 

Some days he’s limping around the office or even calls in sick claiming he’s in too bad of pain to come into the office. He’ll be wincing and just sitting in his chair. He claims it’s from a botched surgery. Somehow he’s been granted FMLA. 

There are plenty of other days though when he’s walking around just fine, even talking walks in the park across from our office or standing around at a coworker’s desk laughing while they talk. 

I’ve made comments like “Gee, you look like you’re really hurting!” on those days and he just says “I’m having a good day. They happen.”

Recently he started using a cane as a prop, which is when I confronted him. There’s no way it’s legitimate need. 

I asked him just how bad his surgery was that now he needs a cane, adding that it was taking the act a bit too far. 

He pulled up his shirt and revealed a dinky little 4” scar near his waist. I said laughed and said “That’s why you’re stumbling around?”

1,"AITA for leaving a restaurant without paying my bill? | There was a post here a couple of days ago that made me think about an event a while ago. 

There was a new all you can eat Japanese restaurant opening in our city and I decided to go with a friend on what I think was the 5th day of their opening week. 
Their formula was that you have a maximum of 10 rounds in which you order something (so not really all you can eat...) and it gets delivered to your table. 
I was a bit disappointed from the start but the options looked good so we placed the first round of orders and waited for that. 

It took half an hour for each of our single bite dishes to come. Granted, the restaurant was almost full, but the kitchen was open and we could see that there was plenty of staff working there, and we were just apologized to for the delay, so I'm not sure what caused it.

No biggie, food was pretty okay, ordered a second round. This time, it took almost 45 minutes for our orders to arrive. Remember, we were with just two, and we ordered a plate with 3 sushi on it and a portion of edamama (cooked soy beans with salt). 
At this point, I'm getting pretty hangry since I saved a lot of place for food and I'm getting impatient. Food is still good, we place a third order. 

No one comes at our table for over an hour. We talk with other people in the place who are also waiting for their orders, even drinks are coming in slow. There were 3 waiters walking around talking to people and we get an another apology but no explanation. 
Our orders were 2 bites of sushi each, and at this point I was fed up with waiting and told my friend if there's no food in 20 minutes, I'm walking out without paying. 

We ended up waiting 30 minutes at the insistence of my friend, but still no food. We left then, went somewhere else, finally had food. 

I've never walked out of a restaurant before, but I think I was justified at this point. Kitchen was still fully equipped, from my guess it was the order system that had something going wrong with it, but waiting three hours for our third round of small bites it just terrible service imo. 

I read reviews of this place the weeks after and it seemed that this kept repeating. A year later and they're still in business and doing better (my brother lastly visited them), but I've been wondering for some time if what I did was wrong?

They broke up, and she came running back and I blew her off. I felt so shitty about it because I heard much later on she had depression not long after and struggled making friends.


We met up recently and I apologized, she accepted. Not gonna lie, I was open to whatever happened. Whether she wants to be friends or date, I wasn't going to bail on friendship.


She made it clear she had a BF which sucks but I'm OK with. Eventually we started texting daily and hanging every week.


Something odd I noticed was she would always complain about having no money. She would suggest we'd go to mid priced places to eat, but then say ""I didn't get paid from work so won't order anything"". 


And I just end up eating by myself. I've bought her food before when she was unemployed but she has a job now. Anyway she recently told me that when she was broke she went on tinder dates with guys to get a free dinner. That same day she brought up to me which places in my city do the best steak.


I told her I don't eat out often unless its a special occasion. She asked again about 5mins later and I changed the subject.

1,"AITA for bringing my daughter home? | 
My husband and I (both 40m) are raising a 13-y/o girl, to clarify. 

My daughter struggles every few months with her period. She’s fine most of the time, but some months she gets her period unexpected at school, and it’s embarrassing to her. She won’t carry pads because they have clear backpacks, and she doesn’t like wearing her own slightly bloody underwear for half a day— understandable. 

When she gets her period, she goes to the nurse with “an awful stomachache” and I am called (I work from home so it’s easier for me to get her.) Nurse always reminds me that she “could be faking” but I always pick her up and bring her home. 

Yesterday, she called again, so I walked into school to get her and the nurse was waiting in the office. Nurse asked me if I was aware that my daughter had “a pattern.” I told her yes, but that we had things figured out. 
Nurse said that if she’s really having stomach problems like this, I should take her to the doctor, because she might have anxiety. I said “thank you, but my husband and I have things figured out.”

Nurse got very cold. “I don’t think you’re taking her anxiety seriously. Fathers are supposed to want what’s best for their girls, and as a nurse I feel it’s my duty to ensure she is safe.”

This lit a fuse with me. Here’s where I could be TA: I told the nurse “I know my daughter better than you do. It is none of your business what her ‘stomach issues’ come from unless a parent tells you.” 

She then told me: “I am afraid if she is not anxious she is manipulating you into bringing her home from school. Is there a class she dreads? Does she do her homework?”

I said: “My daughter is an honor roll student and an honest girl. I’m sorry you don’t think so, but I know her and I know she’s not lying to me. Stay out of our personal business.”
She turned over my daughter without saying much else. 

Daughter will now go to the bathroom and text me instead of the nurse— we’ll just say she has “an appointment.” I feel awful, though, for being ticked— the nurse is a professional who deals with awful parents daily, and I know she was just trying to help.

&#x200B;

That was 2 months ago. Since then she has been staying here, and its just been unbelievably frustrating. She nags and berates me over everything. The food I eat is too unhealthy, I play too many video games, I work too many hours, the friends I have are too rowdy, she tells me like five times a day that I drink too much and that smoking weed is going to kill me, she complains constantly about any girl that I bring over to the point of actively insulting them, she is constantly trying to get me to pray or go to church with her... its not like I am living some insanely hedonistic lifestyle lol. I drink with friends maybe once a week and I smoke pot on the roof with my friends occasionally too, but to her I might as well as spiraling out of control into addiction or something. I went to a party and came home at like 4am, and she was literally awake waiting for me, saying she was worried sick and that 4am is far too late to come home. One time she started literally crying... because she was sad at the sight of me playing video games for 3 hours. She thought it was 'depressing' to see me be so unproductive. I feel like I am just being scrutinized over every little thing now. I almost dread coming home from work sometimes because I wonder what she is going to say. 

&#x200B;

I do love my mother a lot, and she might just be sheltered a bit and its not like she is ever really mad or raises her voice, she is a very sweet woman... but this constant concern from her is just frustrating now. Like really frustrating. I am not 17, I am 28 years old. She might be my mother but she is also a guest in my home. And its not like I am failing at life or something, maybe if I was in poverty or something she could argue my 'habits' are bad for me, but I am doing very well in my career. 

&#x200B;

So I sat down with her and told her... ""look, you gotta go ask your sister to go there. I cant deal with this anymore, and clearly you cant either considering you are seemingly constantly worried about me."". Her sister already offered to take her in, but her sister lives in cincinnati, quite a bit away. She started to cry and I right away felt horrible, but I think that part of her knew that she had to leave. The next day I got a long series of messages from my sister (who lives in spain, far away) about how my mom talked to her and sounded incredibly depressed at what I said to her, and that it doesnt' matter how awful she can be, she is still my mother and I have to take her in.

1,"AITA for punishing 1 of my kids but not the other 2, even though they all did nearly the same thing? | I have 4 kids in total 14yo daughter, 11yo son, 10yo son and 9yo son, my daughter has started to get a bit ""moody"" not bad moody but gets snippy with me, her mom and especially her brothers.  My sons are very close and play pretend WWE ALL THE TIME.  I had 2 brothers growing up and yeah we did that too but nowhere near the amount my boys wrestle.  Where I live its been raining quite a bit and while it was raining they were playing WWE and they all came in with mud everyone on them.  My 11yo is the ""leader"" of his brothers being the oldest and all, my daughter is a little bit of a germaphobe and the 11yo hugged her so she would get dirty too.  The 10 and 9yo also hugged her but they both said something like ""sibling hug"", from my point of view they were innocent but the 11yo did that out of pure malice.  I sent my 11yo to his room and reprimanded him and my wife took the 10yo and 9yo out of the room while I consoled my daughter.

She was really mad and on the verge of crying, I hugged her and she got over it but she said that she's really mad at all three.  I told her the 11yo will get punished cause that was pure malice intent but the 9 and 10yo didn't know and thought of it as something innocent.  She agreed with me and went to take a shower.

I went to talk with the 11yo cause he is going to be grounded for a week for that (which means no video games), and that he owes his sister an apology.  He asked me if the younger 2 are in trouble and I told him no, he got mad at me and said that its not fair he gets in trouble but they do not when they also hugged her.  I explained that they did it cause he did it and they had no clue she didn't want it.

My wife is on my side but my 11yo has been mopey for the past 3 days cause of him being grounded.  I don't know if what I did was right or wrong and I am a bit confused now.  AITA?

EDIT:I talked with the younger 2 and explained the whole thing and they already apologized to their sister",False,False

Since we started dating my mom has always had some things she dislikes, for example, me going to her house (while her parents were there) because she doesnt approve that. And I respect her opinion and have said to her she can have her opinion but I dont have to do it the way she wants me to do it. Recently I suggested going to the seaside with my friends and she supported it until I said my girlfriend might also go with us when she made a scene and forbid me to go if she goes. Today I told my mom I will invite my girlfriend to celebrate my name day and she went crazy, saying its not normal to go to someones house before marrying them, asking do her parents know (of course they know) and stuff like that. She attacked me and I said that she doesnt need to involve herself in my relationship as I do not in her marriage. Im on no speaking terms with my mom now and honestly, Im not sorry.

0,"AITA for ignoring my boyfriend while I’m working? | I (f26) work from home, usually 8-4. My boyfriend (m28) works a pretty much opposite schedule than me as a cook at a bar, so about 3-11 most nights.  So he is pretty much around me all the time on his off time, and I’m alone on my off time.

 Now my job is kind of flexible, as in I can take breaks to get stuff done or whatever, but obviously then I would have to make up those hours later in the day. I prefer to work 8-4, and just be done, unless I have an appointment or something that really needs attention. 

My boyfriend has a really hard time grasping this, and thinks that I am just available for him all the time. I work for a government contractor, so security is pretty tight. He will barge in my office to show me and article he found (usually about football or whatever), or to ask for a handjob, or when I’m going to make lunch, whatever. Not life threatening important stuff. I have told him so many times to not come in the room, or at least knock so I can lock my computer before he comes in, but he doesn’t listen. 

This went on for a month or two, until I just couldn’t take it and we got in huge fight about he needs to just imagine I am not in the house. He breaks my focus, and if I tell him no to one of his requests, I’m being a bitch because I can take breaks, but choose not to. Lately I have just been straight up ignoring him unless I take a break for whatever reason, or I’m done for the day. This morning he was horny I guess when he woke up and as I was leaving the kitchen after getting coffee, he begged me to come to bed with him. I said no, and walked past him to go into my office. He started yelling after me how I’m choosing my job over him, and I don’t care about him, and I’m a bitch. I feel like I’m just being an adult, and working?

I'm not really keen on keeping that big a secret from him and I think it's best if it comes from her.

1,"AITA for failing students who didn't submit an assignment on time? | I'll keep this brief.  I'm a professor at a university and gave my students an assignment that was due on ""Monday, December 2 at midnight.""  In other words, it was due one minute after Sunday, December 1 at 11:59 PM.

About 15% of the class did not submit the assignment on time, tried to submit it yesterday afternoon/evening, and are now claiming that they thought it wasn't due until last night.  I am refusing to budge on giving them all 0s because ""Monday, December 2 at midnight"" is not up for interpretation.  It means ""Monday, December 2 at 12:00 AM,"" which is the first minute of Monday, not the last.

0,"AITA for refusing to apologize to my dad? | I wrote about this a little bit on a different account, but I'm feeling conflicted so here i am writing again.

Backstory: my dad found un-used birth control under my bed about a month ago and was extremely angry over the fact that 1.) I had birth control and 2.) I had it sent to my bfs house. Keep in mind that my parents are extremely strict and religious and can't even see my underwear on the bathroom floor without freaking out

Main story: my dad hasn't spoken a single word to me since the incident. Completely straight up ignores me and just acts like I don't exist. He won't even look at me if I walk by. My step mom on the other hand talks to me sometimes, but only to tell me how sad she is that I'm not like the other girls at church.

It's been hard dealing with this. I'm not comfortable in my own home. I can't even go downstairs to eat right now and I'm starving. They won't let my little brother hang out with me. They made family holiday plans for the 4th and didn't bother inviting me.

My bf and his mom think that I should apologize for ever hiding the birth control in the first place, but mostly to ""make peace"" but I don't want to. I feel like their punishment is too harsh and it's hurting me. I'm completely alone. I have over $1000 in bills to pay and I can't even attend college this year because I don't have the money and they don't help with anything.

0,"AITA for getting a DNA test and confronting my parents with the results? | In 1993 when I was 16(F) I met my biological mother and during that time,I was advised that her husband, John was my biological father; when I was conceived, my mother was 17/18 and John was married man with a family. 

The reason for the late introduction to my parents was that I was abandoned by my biological mother at the age of 2 &the courts granted custody to another (non-relative) person who raised me from ages 2-16;for 14 years I did not know that my mother was alive. In 92,John reunited with my mother and they got married and had my sister. It was around this time my mother confided John about my existence & they hired a private detective,I met them,&I heard a forbidden love story involving my mother,John and me being the result of such love affair to which I accepted as truth. 

John is very unwell;he &I have grew close as he's a really great guy but I always knew there was something off about our relationship. My mother & I are not close at all as she is utterly insane; I havent spoken to her in almost 6 years & I have no interest in having her in my life.

Fast forward to the present: after years of doubting my parental lineage & various disputes and my need to seek the truth, it was (forcibly) encouraged by my mother to obtain a DNA test as she had no doubt of my paternity. Well, I got one of those Ancestry DNA tests & determined that John is not my biological father; needless to say, I am very confused about this paternity deficiency. I am also very heart broken; everything that I know & have been told is a lie - that fucking stupid love story about me is all bullshit. 

I advised my mother & shared the DNA results have not heard from her (nor will I). I waited 2 weeks to shared the results with John and he responded ""I always knew that this call would happen, it was a matter of time"". A week later when I followed up with John, he advised that he spoke to my mother & they both concluded that my test results were wrong & that I am being dishonest with them; I am speechless about this; I have always insisted with John that nothing will change between us, I am truly appreciative of his presence in my life.

I have tried to share these results with my (half) siblings to be transparent; my half brother told me to ""fuck off"" & my half sister went off on me telling me that I am ungrateful for our parents from saving me from the abuse I lived with, and that ""daddy is so sick"" and for me to do this and ""to put the parents through this shit"" makes me an asshole.  

I have not spoken to anyone about this as I feel dreadful, maybe ashamed too; my therapist advised that it is not my fault and that what I am feeling is normal and justified, but I still cannot shake this feeling: AITA for getting this test and sharing it with my non-biological father?

1,"AITA for missing my brother in laws wedding? | I have a group of friends from way back when and each year we go on a big trip together. This years trip was in February and we went to Vegas. We book these trips at least six months out and because of schedules it’s really hard and basically impossible to change the dates after it’s booked or people won’t be able to go. 

My brother in law got engaged last year and when they picked a wedding date it was the same weekend as my trip with my friends. I asked my wife if she thought they could pick a different day but she refused to even ask them. I kind of figured then she was okay with me missing it for my trip because she knows how important they are to me. 

When the invitations came she asked me what I wanted for the dinner choice and I said I wasn’t going. She flipped out. She said she couldn’t believe I was being so selfish and this is family. I said I tried to tell her a few months back but she wouldn’t get it changed.  

Anyway, the weekend came and she tried to throw me this huge guilt trip about not going and letting her down, saying I was going to miss an important day and that she needed help with the kids (even though it’s family and there will be plenty of people there). I told her I was sorry but this other trip was scheduled first and it’s the only time I get to see my friends, where we see her family all the time.

1,"AITA for lying about being depressed? | My friends wanted to get some extra input on this situation so suggested I post here.

I’m a last year college student and I’m working on a large piece of work which counts towards a large portion of my grade. I’ve been taking extra shifts at work these past few months and haven’t started it yet and it’s due next month- I’ve had since last May to start working on it. At this point I don’t really care about my final grade as I have a job lined up already when I graduate- I’m going full time in my current job. 

One of my professors who oversees this piece of work emailed me recently to see where I was with it and I had to go for a meeting with them and admit I hadn’t started it yet. They asked if there were any health or private issues going on and if so they could maybe give me longer to submit the work. 

I have to add, recently one of my friends has been diagnosed with depression and she has been put on Prozac for it- as a result she has been given extensions for all of her work. 

In a moment of panic I said I too had been diagnosed as depressed in the hope I could also get an extension. I am planning on going to the docs this week to lie and get a letter from him to confirm I am depressed. I told my friends this and they now won’t speak to me and think I am an asshole- but I don’t see the issue. No one else is getting hurt it’s just a small lie?

1,"AITA for not telling my wife I was laid off work? | Not using a throwaway here so I will try to keep things brief. My company, well my former company, recently went through a round of layoffs and presented multiple departments with a voluntary severance package. Given my role/years with the Company, i was offered 6 months salary to essentially quit. I am not sure what got into me that day, but upon seeing the offer, I jumped right on it.

I know that being in a marriage is to be part of a team, and that important life decisions like this deserve to be communicated with each other. Like i said, not sure what got into me, but being offered \~$60k to quit was quite the rush.

So this was about a month ago. Money isn't tight given I received this upfront. Problem is, I never told my wife and have been ""going to work"" each morning business as usual. I plan to get back into the workforce and have been applying to jobs, fully expecting to have an offer within a few months. I leave for ""work"" each morning as I typically had, but now usually spend my day at the local indian casino, gym in another city, or sometimes just go for hikes.

0,"AITA for not wanting to help teach my husband my native language by telling him to get a teacher instead? | My native language is Arabic. It’s a difficult language to learn. He has made efforts to learn it in the past but has become more serious about it. On top of that, there are many different dialects and I am Egyptian so he’s finding it hard to make use of the Arabic we learn.

Every waking moment he asks me to translate something for him or to practise with him, which involves only responding in Arabic to him or translating every word he says in English back to him. When we are visiting my parents he expects me to translate every single word anyone in the house says.

I appreciate his eagerness to learn but it is becoming frustrating. I can’t even ask him a simple question without him requesting me to say it in Arabic. 

Now, when I do that he gets upset for me overly correcting him and when I try to not do that he says I’m not helping him enough. We can’t have a normal fluent conversation anymore.

I said to him that I can’t be his husband and his teacher and that he has to sign up for actual 1-1 lessons. He says that will not be helpful because of the difference in dialect and formality of getting an actual teacher.

Now he is saying I’m unsupportive and not allowing him to get fully accepted by my family. This is a whole other thing not worth getting into but if you’re remotely with intercultural relationships you’ll know what I mean.

I think I can support him without my involvement and would find it easier to help him if he gets a basic understanding of the language first from an actual teacher. It’s frustrating to be forced to talk to him when he doesn’t understand the language but still expects me to start a full on conversation and just go from there. I told my family to just keep it at English when we visit so he feels more involved.

1,"AITA for pointing out my roommate's promiscuous behavior? | I (23/F) live in a house with 6 girls - we all pay rent and go to the same school. In the beginning it was fun, we all hung out, went drinking, and stayed in for movie nights together. 

However, for the past few months, one of my roommates is always having guys she meets on Tinder over. Because of this, she doesn't hangout with the rest of us anymore and often declines our offers to go out and do stuff. 

She's clearly obsessed with men, specifically white guys (she's black) and often has issues with them constantly hurting her feelings, and last month she even experienced a pregnancy scare. Previously, I've tried being sympathetic but I really feel like she does it to herself. 

Lately, I haven't been inviting her out with us and recently she brought up that she was upset and felt like we didn't want her around. I called her out on her behavior and pointed out the fact that she rather sleep around with guys who don't really like her, and how I think she needs to address the fact that she is insecure and needs to stop hanging out with guys who treat her so badly.

0,"AITA for not telling my depressed friends about my cancer diagnosis? | I got diagnosed with a very low grade myeloma blood cancer last month. Its not an immediately serious situation because it’s such low levels currently, but I have been trying to digest the news that I have a higher chance of it progressing into needing treatment and my life expectancy has been laid on the table.

I didn’t tell my “close group (5 of us, one is my brother)” friends about it. At some points I tried to, but I felt their support system had been really bad over the last few months because they are all consumed with themselves and their own depression these days. Any mention of my health over the last 6 months has been passed off and subject changed. 

I posted a new tattoo I got on Instagram with a caption talking about indirectly about how I wasn’t going to my prognosis effect or stop me from moving forward. They saw this and assumed I was lying about having cancer (at this point they knew I had benign levels but they weren’t aware it had progressed) or clout chasing and have grouped together to ignore me all month, then sent me a long message about how they need time to “process what I have done that’s hurt them” and that they “want to repair their relationship but they are not ready”. 

The hurt they are referring to is that they think I was either 1) lying about it or 2) not telling them above telling a large social media platform  

... what I cant wrap my head around is how it feels they’re kind of proving my point that they are more absorbed with themselves so I didn’t see much point in telling them. The way they’re acting makes it seem they are more concerned about how they feel about me not telling them, than they are about what I’m actually having to process. 

I think it would have been better to tell them up front and not find out via social media, I see their perspective on that, but if it was reversed, the way I feel about finding out wouldn’t matter much to me if my friend was going through that once I did find out? I responded to their message clearly explaining I didn’t think they had been a good support system lately and it was ignored.

1,"WIBTA for ""outing"" my sister as straight? | My sister (26) is a secondary school teacher. She's always been a bit of a character; she's on the spectrum and can be very awkward and obsessive.

This was a total shock to me, as she isn't gay. She's never dated a woman or suggested she wants to.

I'm worried that she maybe doesn't realise this isn't an ""okay"" thing to fake, and it could negatively affect her personal life or the kids she works with. Also, I just think it's wrong to lie. WIBTA if I contacted the school to tell them she's actually straight?",False,False

1,"AITA for telling my husband he needs to box up his deceased wife’s stuff so we can move into their old bedroom? | I met my husband about 10 months ago at grief counseling. I was there because of a late term miscarriage and he was grieving his wife who had just passed away in a car wreck. (Sorry if this is too heavy for some people, by the way. We’re both doing super well now).

I was obviously very sympathetic to the situation and never expected us to become more than friends. But we ended up connecting and got married within months of knowing each other, which I don’t regret at all. I also now have a 6-year-old stepdaughter who’s been incredibly sweet to me, given the circumstances.  

When we first got engaged I sold my condo and moved into my husband’s house to live with him and my stepdaughter. It’s a gorgeous, spacious home and I love it. 

The problem is that my husband still is keeping the master bedroom exactly as it was when his wife was alive. All of her clothes, jewelry, makeup, etc. —just like it was the day she died. This is what my stepdaughter tells me. I’ve never actually been in the room because my husband generally keeps it locked and has made it somewhat obvious he doesn’t want me to go in there. 

So we currently sleep in one of the guest bedrooms. It’s comfortable enough but I’m starting to get tired of this situation. At first I was tolerant. I know our relationship moved quickly and everyone had to make some adjustments. But it’s now been almost a year and he’s still done nothing. 

I got so angry yesterday that I called the room a shrine (which he didn’t like at all) and said I might leave if he didn’t finally box up her things. I didn’t actually intend to follow through with that. I was just upset and hurt and wanted him to understand how important this is to me. 

Whenever I bring this up he rationalizes and says he’s keeping the room that way for his daughter. But I honestly think it’s for him. I’m sure my stepdaughter loved her mother very much but I don’t think she’ll be particularly traumatized if the house no longer looks exactly like it did before. Besides, she is only allowed in the room when he decides to unlock it for her, which isn’t all that often. 

He also said he doesn’t see what difference it makes to me because the guest room is basically a second master. But that really isn’t the point!

1,"AITA for lowballing a guy asking for selling advice - so I could buy said thing cheaper? | So right off the bat I concede its a bit unscrupulous.  But here's the deal. This guy I loosely know asked me how to sell a really nice couch. I'm in need of one, and since I've dabbled in carpentry he asked me to take a look at it, and give me a price. Seeing the opportunity I maybe sort of lowballed him by about 250, and said I could take it off him. I gave him the money as promised, added an extra ten for the trouble and went home with my couch.

I had friends over, and when I told them how I got the couch some of them were indignant, calling me an asshole who manipulated a guy and scammed him out of money. I figured it was a decent deal. He got decent money, I got the couch I needed for half price. But I wanna check with someone who isn't inside my general social circle.

1,"AITA for telling a girl none of us actually like her in front of everyone | Hoo, this is a long one. 

So basically, in our town there’s no girls hockey team, so Serena (14F) joined ours (14-15M). We’re a tight group... except for Serena. It’s annoying because we have to change quickly and then leave about ten minutes so Serena gets the room to herself. She’s always complaining and she can’t keep up with the rest of us. She’s one of the best players in the female league before it ended but she’s slower and smaller than all of us. She, however, always talks like she’s the best out of all of us and if she scores one goal she’ll yell over and over again “how does it feel to get beat by a girl?” 

So we’re in the same class and she was talking to a bunch of girls about how she’s only friends with boys because there’s “less drama” and how we’re all really protective over her and treat her like a little sister. 
My first thought was that’s total bullshit. None of that is true, none of us are friends with her but she’s constantly trying to get in our group. It’s irritating, she gets all pissy if we talk about shooting hoops after school and acts like she deserves to be invited.

I was prepared to let it go, but today apparently a guy asked her out and she said he has to go through all her “guy friends” because they’re really protective over her. First of all, what the fuck? So in math class, when he comes over to talk I finally yell out, “None of us like her, she can date whoever she wants and she’s NOTHING like a little sister!” 
Cue all the girls looking at Serena, and then her bottom lip kind of trembles and she asks to go to the bathroom.

Her and her best friend cornered me after class and told me I embarrassed her in front of everyone and just because I was jealous of him doesn’t mean I had to throw a temper tantrum. I told them to fuck off and left.

0,"AITA for sleeping on the couch when my boyfriend wakes up early? | So my boyfriend works at UPS and goes to work between 3-5 am. 4 months ago, I was in a car accident and have some pretty nasty pain. The only place I could sleep for months was the floor and couch and progressed to being able to sleep on the couch and bed.

My back and knee pain (discs and both ACLs) has increased tremendously again, and I’ve mostly been sleeping on the couch because my boyfriend cuddles me/sleeps in weird positions to where it puts my back and knees into spasms and sends my body into a panicky, squirmy, painful mess and I need to escape. If I don’t fall asleep before the pain ramps up, I’ll be awake until 3–7 am.

When he wakes up, he’s loud and, in my opinion, pretty selfish. He turns on every light in his path as he makes his way to the kitchen (completely open floor plan on first floor). We have Philips Hue lights in the living room, which I wouldn’t mind so much if he made them dim, but he doesn’t. Just full on blaze.

I even have a routine on the Hue Strip behind our couch to come on just for him (probably 70% bright), so he can glide right past to the kitchen and not turn the living room ceiling lights on, but nope. I don’t mind the kitchen lights as much since it’s further away.

I’ve suggested he use his phone flashlight when coming down the stairs because one of the stair lights is in the living room and instantly wakes me up. He did not like this idea.

This morning, I let my annoyance be known and put one of his sweatshirts that he left on the couch over my eyes. He took it from me and hung it up because it’s his “good sweatshirt”, which I thought to be a petty move.

And, just like every morning, he slams the door closed (the door is always locked, so you have to give it a little extra force, but I manage to be able to do it pretty soundlessly by being gentle). And then he drove off to work in my brand new $40,000 car. He has a 40 minute commute and his car is much older, so I’ve let him use my car since I’m not currently using it.

I know by sleeping on the couch, I’m going to be disturbed by him no matter what and I can deal with that to a degree. I’m upset that he doesn’t try to tone any of it down when it’s absolutely possible. Him turning on just the kitchen light versus every single light in the house is a difference of me being able to fall back asleep or staying up forever.

He suggested I sleep in the spare room on the air mattress, but for the same reason I usually don’t sleep in bed is because I can’t prop myself up as well (sleeping directly on my back compresses some nerves). Plus it’s cold in there and he hates when the heat is on.

My actual bed was also very expensive and is on an adjustable base, which I would use if he wasn’t around, but I’m not going to subject him to sleeping practically upright with his legs elevated just so I can sleep in the comfy bed.

So am I the asshole for sleeping on the couch and getting annoyed when he turns lights on?",False,False
0,"AITA for not going back home from a international trip when my sister lost her baby? | 

So my fiance and I went on a trip to Europe during the holidays to visit and meet his family. We just got back a little while ago.

While we were on the trip something happened and my sisters baby had to be delivered really early by c-section. The baby ended up dying.

We still had another 5 days on our trip, so I told them I would come over right when we get back.

So I went over to see her right after I got home. She was upset I wasn’t there right away. My brothers were really angry I wasn’t there to help deal with the situation.

0,"AITA Because I don't want to go to my friends Moscow Wedding | So basically my friend is getting married and asked me to be the best man. Originally they said they were going to get married on a local beach which was fine and I accepted being best man because he really is one of my longest best friends. 

&#x200B;

All of the sudden they've decided they're going to do a destination wedding in Moscow Russia. I told him that I think that's awesome and i'll make sure to send a gift and that he better make sure he takes pictures because I can't wait to see. He said ""what so you're not going?"" I told him i'm sorry but that I won't go to moscow. I've never left the country, don't have a passport and have a deathly fear of flying, for reference I live in michigan and the couple time's I've been to Florida even though the rest of my family flies I'll drive (besides road trips are fun right?). 

  
He's now upset saying that I'm not supporting him, I told him the rule with destination weddings is always that you have to be prepared that not everyone's going to be able to go. He's now upset because not only am I not going, none of his friends are going his stepson isn't able to go because the bio dad (who we've had issues with in the past but I understand his reasoning for this) won't sign off on his son going to Russia, basically only his parent's will go. Now some of them don't have the money, I seem to be the only one just scared of leaving the country, and the rest just don't want to go to Russia (because like.... who wants to go to russia?). He's saying we're not supportive of his wishes, which I disagree with he chose a destination wedding which automatically means a lot of people can't go, and he chose a really weird destination, which a lot of our friend group is LGBTQ and russia's known for not being friendly to that group. But my family is saying because of how long we've been friends I should get over my fear and go support him.

I loved this man. He and I lived a year in the States together after he lost his job and his marriage fell apart. My other siblings did not come with. We grew apart as I headed off to college, but I tried to keep in close contact. Other than my mother (who had divorced him), I was closer to him than anyone. He was more than a father, but a brother and friend.

I felt it appropriate to make a post on FB. This is the primary mode of communication with my friends and peers. Maybe in hindsight I should have waited, but I am in grief.

Two of my sisters texted me very hostile messages condemning me posting about him. I was blown away. One said I should have waited ""at least three days"" and the other said ""only tell people with your phone number."" I was shocked. I had no idea there was a stigma around these kinds of posts. I apologized for making the post and wished them well. They are still furious with me. One of my brothers called me last night and he didn't seem to mind. I just feel so shitty both from grief and guilt that I've done something wrong to memorialize my father.

0,"AITA for splitting one order into 3 deliveries? | I was ordering some stuff online. About 9 items, 3 were around £25, 3 were around £15, and 3 more were about £10 (all rounded numbers but roughly these amounts). There was also a sitewide 3 for 2 sale. I put them all into my cart initially and the £10 items were taken off the total, at which point I realised that if I did it as 3 purchases, one with all the £25 items, one with all the £15 items, and one with all the £10 items, I'd save more money, so I went from having about £30 knocked off the total to having about £50 taken off. It wasn't a huge discount but it was nearly double what I would have gotten taken off otherwise, so I put it through as 3 separate purchases.

My packages came today as 3 separate deliveries all by the same guy, all about an hour apart. They also all had the same packaging and were all addressed to me. On the first delivery the guy was cheery, asked me how I was, made small talk, ect, but by the third delivery the guy seemed a bit annoyed.

After he left the third time my roommate mentioned the 3 identical boxes and I said that I had to get them separately to get the discount but I reckon I pissed off the delivery guy. She then said ""please tell me you didn't make him make 3 deliveries all to here"". I said nothing. She then said ""oh my god you probably looked like such a dick"" and said that he probably had to make 3 separate trips to wherever he picked them up from and then back to here. I mentioned the discounts again and she said that I'd basically saved £20 but made the poor bloke go back and forth for literally hours and not to do it again. I now feel like a dick.

She then asks is it ok to drink it after it’s already been poured...I tell her that you’re supposed to ask to go into the fridge and pour it. Not pour it and then ask for permission to drink it.

1,"AITA for getting the cake my family always gets, knowing that my gf is allergic? | My family always gets this amazing strawberry cake for every celebration since I was a kid. The only thing that has changed is we now get it with chocolate frosting, because my nephews love chocolate.

My gf of two years is allergic to strawberries, so she can't have this cake. I felt really bad when we served it and she couldn't have any at all. So the next time we had cake, I picked up a chocolate cupcake for her. She split it with my nephews, who - again, love chocolate

Fast forward to this weekend. I got a job offer at a huge company that will change my life. I'll be making three times my current salary! I'll be managing an international team! So cool

Anyway, I told my gf first and she was super happy for me. I told her I was going to take my whole family out for dinner and tell them then. She offered to pick up a celebration cake. Of course, I'm going to pick the same cake we always have, except this time I'll order 4 cupcakes - so that my gf doesn't have to share with my nephews. I call the order in and she goes to pick it up the day-of. Dinner was great, whole family was super happy for me, it was an amazing day, I thought.

My gf was quiet today and when I asked what was wrong, she said

> It isn't about the money. But I didn't want to buy a cake that I couldn't eat and then pay extra, times four, for a treat that I could enjoy on my own

First, I offered to pay for the whole thing. I also told her that it's tradition, we always get that cake. It's like if she was colorblind and told us to not decorate the house green and red at Christmas, because she was the only one that couldn't enjoy it

She countered that we changed it to chocolate frosting because my nephews like it, so clearly there is room to change traditions. She also said that chocolate frosting is a preference while hers is not. I said it's because my nephews are family - not to imply that she isn't or won't be one day. 

She challenged me and asked if we had a kid who was allergic to strawberries, would my family change the tradition then? I told her I don't know, probably? How is this even relevant?

She said she felt like I don't take her into consideration (not true) and especially not as much as I give for my nephews. She even said nephews are spoiled. I can see her point that they do get a lot of what they want - which is why I got 4 cupcakes - 3 for the boys and 1 for her. 

She said she didn't want to eat cupcakes forever & that it made her feel like an outsider of my family (which she is, because we're not married)

1,"AITA for not wanting to go to my sons wedding? | Throwaway.

My son has been dating 'Vanessa' for nearly 3 years now, last weekend they annouced they were enagaged. I have never been fond of Vanessa, mainly because she has never gelled with the family due to her general aloof attitude and lack of effort to engage socially. She will often refuse to join in conversations or activities. My son insists it's because shes shy but I think its very clear that she believes herself 'above us'.

I also strongly susspect she is using my son for his money, she has almost no income, she works as a nanny 2 days a week and spends the rest of the time selling hand made crafts on etsy or at markets. My son is in a well paid tech job and I think she is taking adavantage of the fact he's well off. She jumped at the opportunity to move into his nice aparetment very early in their relationship because she had been living in a unplesant house share. There have been other similar instances.

My son was at my house a few days after the annoucment and the conversation turned to the wedding. We were discussing venues and I mentioned our local church, he told me that Vanessa didn't like the idea of having it at church as she wasn't religious, she wanted an outside wedding. I told him that was just impractical, he has several older family members who would not only find the idea of a non religous, outdoor wedding distasteful but would struggle with the limitations that come with it, poor seating, lack of proper toilet facilities, bad weather etc. He said they would figure it out and it was their wedding so it shouldn't matter what the rest of the family thought. This is very unlike my son as I've always taught him to be considerate of others opinions and the value of family. 

At this point I was upset and hurt and told him that I didn't agree with the ideas they had come up with and I didn't want to put any money towards the wedding like this. My son got angry and told me that they didn't need any financial help, they had savings and Vanessa was planning to cut costs by making decorations. I said he was going to end up blowing all HIS savings and there was no way she'd be able to make all the decorsations with all the other things she'll be focusing on during planning so he'll end up paying for those too and they'll start married life with a huge dent in his savings which is just a terrible idea.

He then accused me of never supporting his relationship and told me if I wouldn't support his wedding then I might as well not come. I told him I might take him up on that as I don't support his attitude and maybe his own mother not wanting to come to his wedding will help him realise how ridiclous he's being about it.

We were worried so we send him to a therapist and now he goes once a week. In our eyes he is still the same kid that before. We tried to think about things that he may have. We thought maybe he is bulimic or anorexic ( as he is very thin ) but he isn’t that skinny and those things tend to affect women, not men.

We decided that theorizing wouldn’t give us an answer so we ask his therapist and refused, saying that he couldn’t say what my son told him. I told him that we didn’t want the specifics but at least the reason why he goes to therapy. But he refused again. We try to insist many times but he didn’t give up.

And the day after, our son come to us and tell us that he know that we insisted on knowing why he wants therapy ( we don’t know if the therapist told him or maybe he hear us talking about it in the house ) and insulted us. He didn’t talk to us for the rest of the day.

My girlfriend and I have been together in a monogamous relationship for 3 years. I have fairly traditional values regarding relationships and a very broad definition of what I consider to be cheating or inappropriate behavior. Included in there is exposing ourselves to other people (obviously aside from medical shit or locker rooms) and especially without talking about it beforehand first, this was a dealbreaker we both agreed on. She has always known and seemingly shared my boundaries and we've never had any issues.

As a ""belated"" Christmas present, she presented me with an envelope of about a dozen photos. Each of these photos were of her naked in very suggestive poses. I thought it was great, and asked her how she managed to get such awesome results on her own. She then informs me that she didn't have them taken on her own, she went to a photographer.

I'm absolutely livid. In my opinion, if someone told me ""I love my car, but I don't ever want you to do anything to it, if you do I'd be very upset"" and I went and customized their car anyway then called it a gift, they'd still have every right to be upset because slapping the label of ""gift"" on something doesn't diminish the fact you still did something you knew they'd be upset about. She keeps insisting she did it for me and I keep telling her outright I specifically told her that she knew I wasn't cool with that shit so I have no idea why she'd ""do it for me."" I returned the money she said she spent on the shoot and communication has been very strained.

0,"AITA for being upset with my boyfriend's 'prank' | I'm still not sure if I'm really in the wrong here or if I was overreacting.

So we just had some roommates move in yesterday. It's a guy I've known for a few years and his girlfriend. So I was sitting on the couch watching football and talking to them when my boyfriend told me he was taking our dog and his mom's dog (who we're dog sitting) on a walk. I said that was fine but be careful since walking two dogs can be more of a pain.

So he gets back from his walk and he only walks in with his mom's dog. He says 'other dog broke the harness and ran away, come help me find him.'

So I was freaking out at this point and asked, 'he ran away?' and he told me 'yes he's loose somewhere.' so I jumped up, ran and grabbed my shoes and sprinted out the door to find him. On my way out I asked the girlfriend to watch things while we go look. 

As I got in my car my boyfriend showed me the dog was in the backyard.

 Now I was super embarrassed in front of the new people in our home. I told him don't ever do that, that wasn't funny to me, it was just embarrassing. He told me it was just a joke and to get over it basically

0,"WIBTA for naming our daughter the same name as our cousins daughter? | Me and my wife found out we were expecting back in March, and are due sometime in December. Even before we were trying to have kids, we decided that if we had a girl, we wanted to name her Evelynn, after my wife’s grandmother. 

A couple months ago we moved back to Ohio, where wife is from originally, and reconnected with her aunt that still lives their. We love aunt. She’s the typical favorite-aunt, lots of bonding, etc type of person. Aunt has 2 kids, who are our cousins, that we’re not especially close to, but we spend a fair amount of time together now that we live 40 minutes apart. When we moved up, the older cousin and his wife were expecting, and they have since had their kid. 

At some point, wife apparently tells aunt that we’re planning on naming our baby Evelynn if it’s a girl, after grandmother. Aunt is excited. Yay. 

Then, the older cousin and his wife have their kid, and name their kid Evelynn. To our knowledge (and coming from aunt, as well) they didn’t really have a name picked out ever, and went with what they thought would be best the day their daughter was born. 

I don’t have a problem at all that they named their daughter Evelynn, after all, Grammy Eve was their grandmother too. My question is this, would we be the buttholes if we went ahead and named our daughter Evelynn too? 

Other than some family events being a little confusing, I can’t really see any issue with it, especially since we’re not super close, but I would hate to break some huge unknown social faux-pas. And we did have the name picked out first, even if their kiddo was born before ours.

0,"AITA for fighting for a rent charge that's incorrect in my favor? | I moved in Nov 14, my monthly rent is 1175. In November I paid an 1175 deposit, and a second 1175 for the first month under the agreement that December's rent charge would be a prorated charge for 17 days, Nov14-30, which would be $665. 

My landlord screwed up and did the math based on 14 days, Nov01-14, which is $548, and 548 is what is explicitly stated on my lease as my second months prorated charge.

0,"AITA for buying dice? | So I thought I was fine, but I got bombarded with a few comments saying I was taking advantage of somebody for buying dice off of them so I figured I'd come here because now I'm unsure.

To start, I'm a bit of a dice collector. Some of these sets have been discontinued for ages and are impossible to find, and are largely dependent on somebody being willing to give them up, which is almost never. I came across a rare set tonight.

So tonight I was at my local game store for FNM. A 17 year old guy came in and had a block of dice that usually gets used for counters in M:tG. When I was paired up against him I noticed that they were actually a very rare set of dice that have been discontinued for 16 years now and are very valuable. I asked to see them and as soon as I looked I knew exactly what they were. I started telling him about the dice, how they're rare and valuable to collectors, why they're so special and their history, and how much they're roughly worth, as I didn't remember the exact going price. He seemed surprised but excited that he had something so special. I then asked if he'd possibly be willing to sell me some of them, and he agreed. I wanted to check what the going price for them was because I wanted to be fair; he may not value them the way that I do, but I don't want to take advantage of somebody just because they're not a collector since that’s not cool.

I couldn't find any older ebay searches, so I consulted an FB group I'm in to ask the going rate and specified I was trying to buy from a non-collector and wanted to give him a fair deal. I ended up getting the rough going rate and we agreed on a price, and I bought 9 of these dice from him for $180. That might sound like a lot for these dice but boy howdy welcome to collecting, one of the most valuable polyhedral sets goes for close to $1k now due to demand. We're big sweaty nerds, I get it.

He has 3/4 of the block left so if he ever wanted to collect as well, he has more than enough to work with in the future, and the knowledge I gave him so nobody tries to take advantage of him in the future. He seemed excited to be able to buy some cards he wanted with the money I gave him, and excited that he also found out he has something so special.

However, on my FB post, I got a few comments saying it was taking advantage to even try to buy them from him in the first place, and I was an asshole for doing it even if I paid him what I'd pay an informed collector, and because I'm older than him (I'm 25). I felt because I was older and more informed that being clear with him and paying him fairly would be enough, but now I'm not sure if the dynamics here were poor and I was an asshole about this. I'm super anxious and I've got bad shakes thinking that maybe I hurt somebody with this even if they seemed happy with the deal, so I guess I wanted to know for sure from this sub.

So, it's been 2 weeks and somehow the messages are still coming in.  Thankfully the offers of charity have stopped (here's hoping they were redirected to their communities) but a good deal of them asking whether or not I stopped being a grinch and started being a good husband and father again.  So, to get those people placated first, here you go:  I DECORATED.  Pics without our faces only, sorry.

I also spoke with a financial advisor, who is helping me set up a budget for 2020, and a counselor who helped me realize that I was worth more than the goods I could offer someone.  She recommended 2 separate therapists to me, and neither are taking new patients before the new year, so for now, my wife and I are working on our budget and cleaning out various corners of the house for things to sell.  So far, we've gotten rid of some unused basement furniture, a mini fridge that has been empty for 2 years, a bunch of wine racks and paraphernalia (we don't drink at home since the baby was born 2 years ago, so no need to keep it around) as well as some other things and made about $750, more than enough to pay all the overdue bills, put some money in savings, and groceries in the cupboard.  It's going to be a long road to pay off this cc debt, but we're finally addressing the issue head on and moving in the right direction.

Since my last paycheck (that covered mortgage and utilities, no worries there, for those who asked if I was behind, thank you) I have also been offered (and taken) 3 DJ gigs for Holiday parties.  2 for personal friends/acquaintances businesses, 1 for a charity.  I refused payment for the children's charity gig, instead offering to give the money right back to the kids instead, which was gratefully accepted by the organizer.  The extra cash from the 2 paying gigs paid down some more debt, and was enough leftover to allow me to have bought some nice new books and a Moana doll for my little girl to open on Xmas morning, (to say nothing of the bags of presents from both sets of grandparents full of clothes and toys, so she'll be fine from a presents standpoint).

Inspired by everyone's offers of charity, I volunteered again at Paul's Place in Baltimore, where this time I donned the hairnet and apron and served hot meals.  Cell phones are prohibited inside, plus taking photos of yourself doing charity work defeats the purpose of said work.  I also organized a food drive at my office to provide meal kits for Christmas for needy families, and we were able to donate 574 lbs of food to the MD Food Bank!

Thank you to all who reached out and made me realize that I really was an asshole.  I let my personal shortcomings almost ruin a holiday for my wife and child.  It won't be as fancy as our last Christmases, but I have a feeling that this year will be very special to me, no matter how little is under my tree.  I realized that I have all the gifts I need, and I cannot thank the beautiful people who offered up so much charity to a grumpy stranger.  I didn't need to accept your gifts to accept your love, and the offers alone changed my life.

1,"AITA for telling my sister that she shouldn’t pursue her “dream,” even though it’s unrealistic, when she did the same to me? | For context, I’m 30, and my sister is 26.

Back a while ago, when I was around 23/24, I really was not enjoying my chosen career. I felt like I was a terrible fit for the position and I was severely depressed. On the other hand, I’ve always enjoyed art, especially digital art, and I was tossing around the idea of going to art school. My parents were extremely non-supportive, telling me that I should stick to my chosen career path and that art school would be a poor choice. I talked to my sister about it, as well. She said that it was unrealistic, like my parents did. (Though, admittedly, she did tell me that I should do it if I really wanted to.) She suggested that I give my chosen career a choice for a little while longer, see how it felt, and then maybe try art school. I kept on trucking with my career and now I can say I’m very, very happy with my decision.

Fast forward to now. My sister has been doing her chosen career path, non-health field-related, for a few years. Recently, she came up to me and told me that she’s been feeling dissatisfied with her current position and wants to pursue her “dream” of going to medical school. She was talking about all her plans for getting ready for medical school, etc etc. I told her, just like the advice she gave me, that she should stick out her current position and that going to medical school was unrealistic with her age and her chosen field. I mean, after all, if I could stick out my current career, so can she. She got MAD, saying that she’s always been supportive of what I wanted and dreamed of. Clearly not the case, even if the advice she gave was a good!

Our parents are supportive of her plan, obviously because they think that medicine is more “prestigious” and “worthwhile” than art. My mother chastises me, saying that I should be more supportive of her, and I told her that I was being supportive, just as my sister has been supportive of me. Now I’m mad at them, they’re mad at me, my sister is mad at me, when really I was giving my sister the same exact advice she gave me. AITA?",False,False

Me and my wife have had several discussions asking him to please clean it and countless ""I'll make sure to double check"" in response. Usually I'm the one that cleans it up and I politely ask him to please be more mindful.

Here's where I might be the asshole. Today I went into the bathroom and saw poop smeared everywhere. It took me a ridiculous amount of time to clean and I got pretty mad. So after I cleaned it I yelled at him and said ""seriously you have to be the most inconsiderate dickhole in the entire world. I'm so sick of cleaning up your disgusting messes. There's no way you're doing this by accident anymore.""

I chatted and had a laugh with both of them several times and if either of them had an issue with my suit neither of them mentioned it. 

However, my parents mentioned that some of the ''extended family'' weren't happy with me wearing a black suit and thought it was inappropriate. I was getting some dirty looks throughout from some people but didn't respond, though I got a lecture from my parents when we got home about how I should have gotten something more appropriate.

0,"WIBTA if I told my RA that my roommate never leaves the room? | Sorry, this is my first post on Reddit because I'm kind of concerned about my roommate. She's a freshman and at the beginning of the year, I thought she was really quiet and she was in the room a lot (she plays video games and watches Netflix, primarily), but I thought she was otherwise fairly typical. However, I recently found out that she switched all her classes to online versions of the class and that she's been eating frozen meals instead of going to the dining halls. I was recently sick for a couple of days (so just went to classes that had tests for an hour/1.5 hour) and then went straight back to my dorm. I don't think she left the dorm the entire time. I've tried inviting her out for food or just to hand out with friends, bust as far as I can tell, my question is not an exaggeration at all.

 I'm concerned because it can't be good for her physically or mentally to stay in our tiny room all the time. I'm hoping my RA would be able to tell me that she is already aware of this or she'd be able to refer my roommate to some help. At the same time, I feel like I might be tattling on her and as someone who is also pretty introverted, I can kind of understand why she doesn't want to leave.

So around 21 years ago, before I was born, my uncle died in a car crash on my parents’ wedding day. The whole family was crushed, but life goes on and his affects had to be dealt with. 

His wife, my aunt, sorted through what she wanted to keep and what she didn’t, and put what she didn’t want up for grabs. What she didn’t want included some of his shirts that I imagine she thought were ugly while he was alive. 

My mom took them, planning to make a memory quilt, but there were only five shirts so nothing ever got done. Last week she decided to finally do something with them, and so far we have made two bears and plan to make two more. We’re going to give them to his three grandchildren and one more my grandmother, his mother.

The problem is, as soon as his kids caught wind of our project they demanded the shirts back. They said we’ve been keeping them from them all these years and how could we destroy their memories like that? We’ve gotten long sob story texts about how much his shirts would have meant when they were kids, and we were being selfish because he was their family not ours.

They gave us five shirts twenty years ago, and now they want them back. And them saying that he isn’t our family I think is horrible. He was my mother’s only brother and my brother is named after him. She has a right to his memory too.

I forgot to tell my husband, and apparently he got undressed in the bedroom and saw the camera. He came and started yelling at me that I should have told him and now his nude body could be anywhere. So in general yes that’s a good way to think about internet security but the cameras aren’t connected to the internet.

I told him to calm down and I’d delete the footage, so I go and look for it, and follows me and watches. I see the section and it’s him getting undressed, and then he sees the camera and his eyes go wide and he sprints toward it and spins it around. I started laughing because honestly his reaction was hilarious. This only made him madder, and he stormed out of the room.

We are a tight knit group of around 13 workers, 6 of which belong to the same family.

Recently, we've discussed trying to make more of an effort to see each other, so we planned a visit around my work schedule, which was posted a week and a half ago.

0,"AITA If I Choose A Random Couple For Adoption Than Stepsister? | 
So I (21F) am in my junior year of college. I’ve been extremely careful on not getting pregnant and have tried all avanues. My IUD moved and I almost died so I had to get it removed, the implant in my arm left a rash and started to burn so I had it removed, so me and my FWB started using the calendar and condom method which is basically when I’m not ovulating we would use the pull out method and when I was we would use a condom and a Plan B just for backup.

Well, I’m pregnant. I found out in the beginning of December that I am four weeks along. I knew immediately I didn’t want to keep the baby. I considered going through with an abortion via the pill. I got them but couldn’t do it. I know that it was selfish, but until you’re in those shoes you never know how it truly feels.

So I decided adoption. I told my friend that I was planning on delivering the baby and she told me about her brother and her sister in law back in her home state that have been struggling with infertility and have been desperately trying to conceive a baby for years without fail. We FaceTimed a few times and I think they would be perfect parents for my baby. They’re both well educated with well paying jobs and an amazing home they could raise a baby in. It actually made me excited to be able to know that the baby will go to a family that so desperately wants them. I decided they would be a great fit and since they’re so far away, it’s like it never happened kinda thing.

I finally brought it up to my mom yesterday that I’m pregnant and everything else. My moms first words were “What about Sylvia? Her and Jon would love a baby”. My older stepsister is 28 and infertile. She’s known this for years and we aren’t that close so I didn’t know if she ever planned on having a baby through other means.

I said no. Sylvia lives in the same city as me and I see her during holidays and any other family gatherings. I don’t want to adopt the baby into my own family circle and still have to be in some form of its life. I would basically become the step aunt? I just prefer the idea of having a closed adoption in a far away state with a picture every once in a while. My mom started gushing and called Sylvia immediately despite my protests who seemed really happy. She told my mom they were looking into an egg donor and a surrogate but this baby is so much less expensive and less of a hassle.

I told Sylvia that I don’t want to give the baby to her for the reasons I listed above and kind of already “promised” another couple that they could adopt the baby. Now I haven’t went through any legal channels via the other couple so it’s not like I HAVE to do it, but I really want to. Sylvia got upset and asked why I would choose a random couple that I know nothing about versus my own “flesh and blood” (Our parents have only been married for 3 years and we never lived under the same roof as she was 25 then).

I met Greg about 5 years ago. We dated for about 2 months before I broke it off. We were a terrible match; the two words I'd use to describe us together would be ""awkward"" and ""angry"".

Since then I got married and had kids. 6 months ago Greg reached out and told me I was the one who got away. I was flabbergasted to find this out because I  honestly do not think of Greg at all. I was clear with him over the phone that I moved on completely and had no interest in Greg. He said he understood and was sorry to have waited so long. I made sure to emphasize my message by texting him after the call that it was nice to catch up but I have no interest in rekindling anything and that I'm happily married.

He texted back asking if we could stay in touch as friends. I acquiesced, mostly because I figured we were going to lose touch and I'm never going to see him.

Since then we texted a few times a month about very innocent things. Stuff like how is work going, did you see the news, etc. I have reread the texts and they are completely innocent. We never moved past the superficial topics. 

Well. Greg passed away suddenly a few weeks ago. And apparently left everything to me. It's quite a sizeable amount.

Greg had no kids, was never married. He does have a mother and 2 siblings.

His will was painfully clear but offered no explanation to his decision. His mother and siblings are, for lack of a better word, livid. We had a few nasty exchanges. To be clear, I don't think they're angry because they want his money. They sound very upset that they've been out of the loop on his decision. They sound deeply hurt and I can't blame them. I mean really, who am I here? I'm literally some chick he dated for 2 months 5 years ago. I wouldn't be surprised if his family is trying to find a away to intervene.

I do not feel deserving of this. Of course I could use the money (who couldn't?) but it's not like I'm out on the street or anything. 

I know that legally, I haven't done anything wrong. But I'm having a moral crisis here. This money feels tainted. This feels like a ""you're not wrong but you are an asshole"" kind of situation.

0,"AITA for making my roommate's friend leave our room? I | I live in a dormitory, 3 of us (me (19F) and my two other roommates (19F and 18F) ) share a single room. Our beds are about a metre apart from each other, so there's barely any personal space.

There's a little problem with one of my roommates (let's call her A). Multiple times she has invited her friends over without telling us, even though we have a groupchat. It's always sudden, and her friends leave extremely late (one time her friends decided to leave at 1:30 am on a Thursday). Since there's pretty much no space in our room, if A invites 4 people, they sit around on our beds, which is annoying. We tried talking to her that this shouldn't be happening, but she acts really selfish and disregards our interests.

Now imagine this. It's Monday. Me and the other 19 year old roommate (let's call her S) leave in the morning, while A decides to sleep in. I return back to our room at about 3pm, A is still in bed and she tells me that she decided not to go to university today. Understandable. I leave the dorm again, go to library to study, and then return at about 7:30. S is already at the room. At 8pm there's knocking on our door, and one of A's friends (let's call her V) comes in. Alright, it's not that late, she can hang out here I guess, it would've been nice for A to let us know that she's inviting V over though. They talk, loudly. For some reason, sitting 30cm apart means that they have to yell at each other. S and I talked recently that we should tell A once again that this shouldn't be happening, but now it would be too awkward to tell her 'Hey, you should be more considerate of us, we never invite anyone over without telling you'. Well, as 9 pm approaches, they decide to start singing. I message S that maybe V will leave soon, since you know, it's Monday and 3 of us have lectures at 9am tomorrow. That doesn't happen. At about 10 pm S and I finish getting ready for bed, are in our pyjamas, skincare done, makeup off, but A and V don't get the hint – they bring out a guitar. Now A is playing her guitar and V is singing. Anyways, at 10:45 I say ""Hey, it's almost 11pm. Maybe it's enough?"" I'll admit and say that I said it sternly, since I was genuinely pissed off. Well, V giggles and leaves and A decides (probably just to spite me) to play her guitar for another half an hour before she starts getting ready to go to sleep. I was pretty angry considering that she decided to just fuck around the entire day and invite V over late at evening even though she could've hanged out with her during the day.

Well, recently I found out that V is telling everyone in our faculty that I'm hysteric and I screamed at her and made her leave, she just changed the little detail and said that it was 9pm, and not 11.

0,"AITA for not taking my cousin to starbucks? | Okay so, yesterday my great aunt (80s) and her daughter (60s) came to my house to pick up my grandmother (71). I had never met my cousin before in my life, to the point of just having downright no clue who she was when she walked into the house until I went outside and saw my great aunt. After that, we all get sat down, introduce the dogs, etc. I had been playing video games but came out to be polite and greet them and see what my dog was freaking out over.

This is where the issue arises.

My cousin then says she wants a Starbucks and asks where it is. I start describing where our local Safeway is, which has the Starbucks. I also live in a VERY small town. Mid-description she cuts me off and says, ""no, you're not going to tell me where it is. You're going to take me and get it for me."" To which I just stare at her in disbelief. I've never met this women before and she comes into MY house and demands that I drive and buy her Starbucks with the little money I have within 5 minutes of meeting me. After I stared at her I just left.

Fast forward about 15 min and my grandmother comes into my room, asking again that I take her to Starbucks so she'll shut up since she obviously doesn't like her either. I said no because she was extremely rude and demanding, and that I would've had no problem taking her if she would've just asked politely (and didn't demand that I pay for it.) My grandma then says that I'm being just as rude and leaves.

0,"AITA for snapping at my neighbor when she kept telling me how to raise my dog? | Alright, now that I read the title, it sounds pretty bad, but let me explain. My family has a dog who’s six months old and pretty small, think cocker spaniel. He’s a puppy, so he’s jumpy, but whenever we meet people we make sure we can hold him back and he has gotten much better at greeting people. My neighbor, who lives downstairs, has two cats. Of course, whenever the pup meets her he smells the cats and gets all jumpy. We restrain him and apologize every time, usually he doesn’t even jump on her because we grab him. We’re always extremely apologetic about his behavior to her, and make it known that she can tell us if his barking gets too loud. 

Today I was taking him out for a walk as my designated teen duties (I’m 15) and we encounter the neighbor in the tiny lobby space. It’s less than 5x5, so not even much space for two. Of course the dog goes crazy, and I grab him to make sure he doesn’t jump. This is where my neighbor, who’s never owned a dog in her life, decides to teach me how to handle the pup. 

She grabs him, already setting me on edge, and tries to sit him down on the ground. The pup, thinking it’s time to play with this new person, only jumps up more. Then the neighbor begins to go on about how “yeah, this is how it’s done, you have to do it like this.” And telling me that we need to get him into obedience school ASAP. I’m polite, laughing and saying how jumpy he is and sort of agreeing with her. 

I try and leave, saying he needs his walk, but apparently I haven’t gotten her message. She just keeps going on and making these passive aggressive little comments about the dog all while pretty much holding him down. Eventually, I have enough and tell her, 

“Can you please not grab him, it’s making him more jumpy, and we’ll get him in obedience school as soon as the schools open up again, along with everything else.” 

And then leave to go on the walk. She then told my parents about the way I talked to her, but they know she’s like this so swayed more to my side, but told me to not go off on her like that. 

Yes, I know I could’ve been more polite, and I should’ve just left. I also have the suspicion that she doesn’t like the dog much because of the occasional barking, but she always says she can’t hear it? It’s just, she does this all the time and she doesn’t and never has had dog, only cats. AITA for snapping a bit?",False,False
1,"AITA for asking my brother and his fiancee to change their wedding date? | My brother has been with this girl for 7 years. They were never interested in getting married until I got engaged. She got my brother to propose with my mom's costume jewelry. It wasn't even a real ring. They announced their engagement only a few weeks after mine. It was a slap in the face because my fiance went through the trouble to save up for a real diamond ring and he planned a romantic getaway to propose to me. My brother and his fiancee got engaged on the fly with a fake ring and everyone was congratulating them like it was a real engagement. It cheapened my engagement, honestly. My brother was never into the idea but she forced him because they have a child together and he lives in her house.

My brother's fiancee has always been controlling and weirdly jealous of me, and I noticed that she copies everything I do. I wanted my wedding to be a unique event because my fiance and I waited so long to get married. We have been together for 9 years.

We announced our wedding date and then my brother and his fiancee announced their wedding date right after us. They set their wedding only a month after mine. It annoyed me but I didn't say anything. Then I found out that she scheduled her bachelorette party the same weekend as mine. Also, she copied my dinner menu and stole some of my decoration ideas. It looks like their wedding will be nearly identical to mine.

Some family members who live out of town said that they'll be going to my brother's wedding, but not mine. I was very devastated. They said that it's because the wedding dates are so close together and they can't afford to go to both weddings. I chose my date first and my fiance and I don't live together yet. My brother and his fiancee live together and they have a kid, so why are they rushing to get married?

My mom and I invited my brother and his fiancee over to our house and we asked them to postpone their wedding date. Our weddings aren't until July and August so they have plenty of time to change the date. They made a lot of excuses like they always wanted a summer wedding. I asked them to at least change some things about their wedding so it won't be too similar to mine. They got pissed off. Then I asked why they're even having a wedding. They already have a house and a kid together. My brother's fiancee said that she always wanted to walk down the aisle in a white dress. My mom jokingly asked her if she should even be wearing a white dress because she has a kid. My brother flew off the handle and screamed at us. He called me a lot of names and then they stormed out of my house. It has been about a week and they're still giving us the silent treatment.

My mom and I are trying to work with them to make sure that both of our weddings go smoothly, but they won't work with us. A few of my friends think that I should've left this alone, but I think that I'm justified in asking them to change a few things about their wedding. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for finding it difficult to bond with my stepdaughter? | I'm a mother of six kids, one of those kids being my stepdaughter S. Just to get straight into it, my stepdaughter is the product of an affair. My husband had an affair right after our second child was born, and he got her pregnant. It was a traumatic birth, our second was a fussy baby, and we had two kids under two. When I found out my husband had an affair, it absolutely destroyed me. 

Things only got worse after S was born. Her mother passed away when she was just a year old, leaving my husband and I with full custody of her. It's been 15 years, and I've tried as best as I can to make it work. She has not been an easy child from the start; she constantly threw tantrums, got into fights at school and with me, and still acts out now as a teenager. I wish I could say that I love her in spite of it all, but I don't know how to feel about her a majority of the time. 

Last night, at dinner, one of my younger daughters L and I were talking about an upcoming competition (she's part of a dance competition team) and working out the dates I'd likely have to take off because of it. S made a kind of snippy remark about how it was funny that I'd told her I couldn't take off work for one of her school sports events, even though she'd asked me to since her father couldn't either, but I could go to L's no problem. I told her I couldn't, because I was genuinely busy around that time, but I'd have to be there for L's event. 

S starts off on yelling at me, saying that I don't care about her, and we ended up getting into another argument. Typical teenager stuff, she told me that she hates me, but she's going to get over it. My husband doesn't seem to think so, though. He accused me of openly favoring our children, and reminded me that S is my daughter too. I told him I'm trying the best I can given the fact that I have to be reminded that he cheated every single day. S overheard that, and is now refusing to talk to me, but it's the honest truth. 

I know it is not S's fault, and I want to be there for her and have a good mother-daughter relationship, but it isn't easy when your child looks exactly like the woman your husband cheated on you with. No matter what I do, it just feels impossible to bond with her, even though I want to. AITA?",False,False

I did get some of it back and I learned to walk again, but very differently. There is a very weak, possibly nonexistent link between the flu shot and gbs

I saw a similar post on r/all and I feel like I'm in the same spot because I refuse to get a flu shot. My family member does have cancer. I don't currently go to family events but I feel it's unfair and maybe he should stay home sometimes so I can go. Before my gbs, I was fully vaccinated for travel, got every booster and paid for extras not covered by my insurance. My family has the argument that I'm selfish and the person with cancer might die - but anyone can die whenever and I'm missing out on the core family events

I've seen a bunch of doctors for a long time. My case was interesting. Some say to never do a live vaccine again (gbs is autoimmune). Most say don't do a flu shot (a very weak link). Some say I'm fine for anything and it's just superstición. My favorite student doctor said it best ""this is hard enough, right? Why risk making it worse. We aren't sure you'd live a second time. We don't know if it's related to the flu shot but we do know it does happen to people twice"" 

It's just a flu shot. Who cares? Our situations are equal in the end anyway. My family thinks since there's no real link between Guillian Barre and the flu shot I should just get it - that I'm being silly. But the doctor is right, I couldn't survive this journey mentally a second time so why take any risks. Maybe in 50 years we'll have enough data to say they're totally not related but it doesn't matter now.

1,"AITA for not washing dishes every single time? | I live with my girlfriend and I love her, she seems to expect me to wash the dishes all the time, which I consider unfair.

She is the only one who cooks and does the shopping - she's a very picky eater (to the level of using different utensils when she makes something else for me than she does for herself!) and she sais she prefers to pick her own groceries. But after she's done cooking, she just fills the pots and pans with water and leaves them to soak - until she needs them again. Yes, she's very messy.

I used to do the washing up, but then I became annoyed with being the only one to ever do that and stopped. Then she picked up the slack (washing everything before cooking rather than after), but she was clearly angry about it.

Quite recently she asked me to please not put plastic boxes I had food in (I don't know what to call them in English) in the sink, that they are in her way. Why doesn't she wash them and put them away, if they are bothering her so much? And why does she have to leave the pans dirty for days without doing something about them?

She told me once she expects me to do it in exchange for the cooking and shopping, but she was the one who chose to do that and frankly I feel tired being the only one to clean in the flat. (I'm the only one to vacuum, general tidying is done as needed, but usually it's her stuff so I can't do it anyway). 

I told her this, she said fine in an obviously disappointed voice, but now she starts to look angry again and there is almost no space for me to prepare breakfast because of the stupid dirty pans.

1,"AITA for calling out my friend for wearing shoe lifts? | So I have this friend in college who is already a fairly tall fellow. He claims to be between 6’1” and 6’2”. I’m 5’10”. Lately I’ve been noticing him looking a bit taller than usual. It never occurred to me until today to check if he wears shoe lifts. 


We were at a dorm party and he just towered over everyone else. While he was chatting with one of our female dorm mates, I noticed that he was wearing running shoes and his ankles were so high up, making his stance seem very weird, like he was wearing high heels. 


I asked him why he was wearing shoe lifts since he’s already quite tall. He told me he wasn’t wearing shoe lifts. I gave him a wink and said ”okay mate”. The girl he was talking to looked down and said it did look like he was wearing shoe lifts. 


One of our male dorm mates overheard the conversation and pulled one of his shoes off. In the shoe were two shoe lifts stacked on top of each other, which probably gave him an extra inch of height. 


Everyone around us bursted out laughing. My friend took his shoes back and looked so embarrassed. He called us “manlets”, even though he was the one trying to sneak in more height. 


His shoe lifts were the main topic of conversation for the next ten minutes. He kept trying to downplay them, saying that he was just trying them on since his friend gave them to him as a funny birthday present.",False,False
0,"AITA for not always answering text messages right away when I notice them? | Hi Reddit,

I'm in the habit of not always answering text/whatsapp messages that I receive right away. Not that I wait a week before responding, but a few hours is common. Sometimes it's simply because I did not notice the messages, as I don't check my phone every five minutes and the sound usually is turned off. But sometimes I don't respond right away because I 'don't want to'. I don't want to feel forced to give people attention and get in a conversation right away whenever someone feels like sending me a message. I don't want to be obligated to pick up my phone whenever it buzzes.  If something is so important that they need a response right away, they can call me. Otherwise I'll respond when I feel like it.

Now, most people that know me are fine with this. But recently, a slightly drunk friend told me that he thought I was being a dick by behaving like this. His argument was that it barely takes any time to respond to most things and that it implies that I don't give a shit about others. I see his point, but for me it's more the principle of the matter.

1,"AITA for wanting to let my family know my daughter is getting married and post one or two pictures of the cake I'm baking on social media? | My daughter is getting married to her boyfriend of 2 years at the courthouse next week,  while he's on leave from the army. This is not a shotgun wedding. They do not plan to have kids for the foreseeable future (if ever.)

They intend to have a proper wedding in the future, when finances allow. However, in the meantime, she's forbidden me from mentioning it to anyone in our family or even friends of mine who know her,  but do not know the family.

These are kids who never had an apartment and want us (the parents) to give them what they need to get started. It's a financial imposition to ask us to furnish their house, and I know that both my family and the groom's family would be delighted to help if they could. 

In addition, the groom's family all knows this is going to happen and I feel our family will be terribly hurt if they are shut out completely. We're not inviting people to the courthouse,  obviously,  but they can call and offer their Congratulations anyway. I'm worried that, when they finally do have their wedding,  nobody will want to come because they weren't even given the dignity of a notice. 

Further,  I  make lots of crafts and baked goods. I like to post the projects on social media for critiques and she's forbidden me from posting the wedding cake picture. Her real wedding will have a professional cake,  but I wanted the practice, around just a few of us will be there. Frankly, my enthusiasm for helping her is dwindling and I am contemplating *not* baking the cake, as literally this exposure was all I wanted. 

I'm also thinking of offering her less for setting up house. My original thinking was,  they could save up faster if they don't have to buy furniture and dishes. But she won't let us enlist the help of others. We have to replace what we give her and do without in the meantime, because we don't have money to buy these things right now.  We're willing to do this for their comfort. It sure would be nice to see if anyone else is planning on getting rid of some old furniture or dishes so they can get started.

Anyway, he moves in and it's been a few weeks and I've noticed the roommates 8 pets (cats, dogs, chickens etc) are all scratching in a way that I know means fleas (I work with animals, I don't even need to search a pet at times because their behaviour gives it away).

I mentioned again to him that his pets have fleas, and given their current health have probably also got worms. I get the same spiel about how they were only done last month, but they're probably due again now.

He just doesn't seem to care that his roommate, who is keeping on top of their flea and worming preventatives - by the way has an entirely seperate medical supply box for their pets as well - is just wasting money now because he refuses to look after his own pets properly.

1,"AITA for “not supporting” my Girlfriend exercising? | So to paint a picture of my girlfriend, a lot of her hobbies aren’t physical in nature, one of them being gaming. She is lazy (her words, she knows it) does not exercise at all and has said she wants to get better but doesn’t have any motivation to work out (she hates it). So of course when Nintendo announces a dumb exercise game (Ring Fit Adventure), she got so excited. Saying how this could really be a game changer for her blah blah blah.

A few weeks ago she went out and wastes a whopping $80 on this gimmicky crap. she has actually been playing this game every single day despite disliking physical activities. while I’m happy she is having fun, she’s just falling for bullshit claims that playing a video game will make you fit. I say this as someone who works out myself (for real), I haven’t played/seen a lot of the game but I mean really? You can’t be serious, dropping $80 to play an expensive “fitness game” is crazy when you can go out side and jog for free (which is probably more of a workout this game will ever give).

I haven’t said any of this in a mean way. i have only tried to lower her expectations a bit, saying that she’s not gonna get any results from this game. I’ve tried to convince her to come to the gym with me and get some real exercise, our local gym has a two person membership deal so it would be perfect for us. She doesn’t like any of this. She’s upset with me for “criticizing her” and not supporting the fact she’s getting the most exercise she’s had in years, because of this game. I DO support that she work towards a healthy life style, that’s great! But that’s precisely why I’m critical of this, this game isn’t going to do her any good and I’m just trying to encourage her to do something that will actually benefit her.

0,"AITA: New Wife Finds Boxes of Old Wife Photos, Wonders Why Not Thrown Out After 5 Years | So, I'm (48M) recently remarried to a wonderful, sweet woman (47F), my second marriage (first one fell apart after 15 years and three kids, due to my work and military moving lifestyle, and the Ex's (47F) infidelity and homesickness, lack of communication both ways) and my new wife's first marriage (serial dater, got close twice, focused on job later, never had kids until step-momming mine/ours). First wife moved and lives in another state with the kids, all teens now.

We met three and a half years ago, a year after my separation from my wife, before the divorce. I made it amicable for the sake of the kids and not spending a lot on lawyers, but except where the kids are concerned, I have no relationship with the Ex.  That being said, the two ladies do NOT get along, but more ice than fire.  I generally try to maintain detente for the sake of not traumatizing the kids when all of us are together.  I proposed to New Wife this last February while I was stationed in the Middle East (she was visiting) and we married in July (while I was on leave home). We finally moved into the same house this month. Well, combining households, I'm opening her boxes and she's opening mine, some I haven't seen since before I moved overseas, before I proposed.

She finds 4 tote-boxes of former family photos. Most all of which are of the kids growing up and me with the ex, but also some of me and the Ex's wedding 19.5 years ago, photos when we dated, photos from the vow renewal before the separation, some in frames, some still in the photo-mat sleeves. I took half the family pics when I moved out, and honestly, I have not looked at them hardly since. Never did I thumb threw them in some wistful haze, wishing I was still with old wife. I mostly took them for the sake of giving continuity to the kids, intending to eventually pass them along as part of the family record, momentos of when things were still good. But truthfully, I didn't think much about them.

New Wife was VERY upset. She understood (sort of) about the kid pix, and passing those along, but was taken aback by the volume of pix, and the fact that I had not excised the dating, wedding, or vow renewal pics at any time in the last 5 years. We had a fight/cry session and she's soaking In the tub, truly annoyed with me. I admit her feelings are valid, but I don't see there's anything to really be upset about. The past is past. We both had relationships and full lives prior to meeting. She excised everything post relationship, but then again, she wasn't married with kids. Me, I never thought about it anymore, never sought catharsis that way. Now, she's moody, somehow this makes me mad because this shouldn't be held against me, so we're both at odds.

0,"AITA for defending the commune I grew up in, to my coworkers? It was awkward and I'm afraid I came off as judgmental. | I grew up in a commune. It's not something I talk about a lot unless it's with my friends. Not because it was bad; I had a very happy upbringing. But because it comes across as strange to many people.

But last weekend, I was going out and drinking with a group from work, and mentioned something about my ""fathers"". My coworker asked whether I have gay dads, and I said no, they were both straight. I grew up in communal living, and was raised by everyone in the community who wanted the role of parenting.

(Apologies if any of this is confusing, English is not my only language and also I know this topic is strange. I just really want input on whether I crossed a line, I think my life has given me different social norms than a lot of people.)

Anyway, my coworker asked me what I meant of that, and I told him that I had many people in the community who were my parents; there were about 50 people in the commune and 15 with parenting as one of their roles. They are parents to me just as much as my biologic mother and father. And I see the other children from the commune as almost my siblings.

My coworkers had a lot of questions about it, and seemed to see it as something I should have hated. Not having parents in the same way they did, bring brought up with 10 other children and teenagers. 

But I said, No, I loved it. I really meant it, it was wonderful growing up with so many supportive people and having the kind of network that a lot of people don't have in America. There are a lot of lonely people, people who are lonely except for their spouse who they might not even like, etc. I didn't think the nuclear family was the only option; it's possible to love more than one person as a partner if that's what everyone involved likes. And it's possible to love more than two people as parents. Hearts don't have to be small enough to only fit one love and two parents, I said.

And I had not meant that in a mean way, I was drunk and not thinking before I spoke, that's all. I had not been trying to call everyone small-hearts. But that's how a couple of the people I was with took it. They jumped into defending their relationship with their wives and children and saying that their children were loved and cared for and not lonely.

I just said that it's all ok, we have had different lives and I'm glad your life has made you happy. But please respect that my life has made me happy too.

My niece, “L” was the only child in the family for a long time and she was the center of everyone’s world. Cue me getting pregnant with my daughter “B” and having her 2 days before L turned 3. Christmas was the next week and they spent it with us. L was being a typical 3 year old - getting into stuff, whining, tantrums, etc. Sis in law told me that it was because she wasn’t getting the  attention from me that she usually gets. She asked if I’d take L on a day date, just the 2 of us because she was feeling jealous. I said no because I was recovering from a really traumatic labor and taking care of a newborn baby. Sis in law got mad, Christmas dinner fight, the whole shebang. Anyway, that was 4 years ago and it’s the same thing, constantly. L is feeling jealous of my daughter, B. Sis in law doesn’t think that L gets enough attention. 

Because Bs birthday is so close to Christmas and we always had something going on, we never had a big birthday party for her. Just cake and a few balloons on her birthday. L has always had huge Pinterest inspired parties and I’ve only missed one of them because my mom had to be admitted to the hospital the day of and I was the one who took her. Anyway, this year B turned 4 and wanted a party with all of her friends. I scheduled it for beginning of December so all of her friends could come and it didn’t interfere with holiday stuff. Everything went great, B had a great time. Sis in law has decided against a birthday party this year for L because they’re taking her out of town next month for a big celebration. 

Yesterday was my daughters actual birthday and even though we already celebrated with a birthday party, I still wanted to make it special for her. We had a full day planned: breakfast at her favorite spot, movie, manicure then home to get ready for a Christmas party with some close friends at our house. Sis in law calls me. She’s decided that L does need a birthday party and it’s going to be that night (last night). I told her that we couldn’t make it because (1) we had plans and (2) it’s my daughters birthday, not hers and I don’t think it’s fair that my daughter has to share her special day.

Sis in law called me multiple times during our Christmas party, niece called multiple times and left messages, asking why we weren’t there.

0,"AITA for shouting at my mother that her new belief (NATUROPATHY) is a scam? | To give some background to the story, my mother never worked in her life, my father was able to provide for the family and she preferred looking after us and the house. So after me and my sister left our parents home (I moved to another country, my sister in a small town nearby my parents), start working was not an option for her because she's now in her 50s with no skills and/or qualifications. I guess being alone in the house made her pretty bored and I think also a bit depressed. 

So when she came up with this idea of going to this (very expensive) evening Naturopathy course, I was not totally against it although I thought it was silly. I just hoped it could be an hobby for her and entertain her. This was 3 years ago and I think things are degenerating. 

She's now obsessed with gluten, she's not celiac or gluten intolerant but at this course someone told her that gluten is bad and causes every sort of disease so now she would not touch it and does not allow my father to touch it neither. She spends hundreds of Euros in vitamins and food supplements because apparently this cure everything and are detox etc. She believes that negative thoughts are also the cause of every sort of disease and that if you think positive and eat following her diet (which is just everything except gluten and sugar) you can cure every disease. This seems harmless because she's not sick. However, she recently convinced my grandmother to stop taking all her drugs (my grandmother is old and has some problems with her blood pressure, back, and lungs). She recently told my father to stop taking one of his medications (he has colitis) because apparently 'the doctor want to sell this medicine to take money from the pharmaceutical company"". And now she wants to spend 450€ for a chromotherapy pen sold by a friend of one her teachers. This is just a pen with a light on top of it. And it's 450€ for the beginner one. Then she needs to buy one for 1,500€. These are just few examples of her new obsession with Naturopathy.

After realising things are now degenerating, I tried my best to explain that there are no evidences that the things these people teach her at this course work. That a pen with lights can't cure diseases and there are no researches made on any of the theories she reads about. I tried to convince her that my father and grandmother need their medications. I tried to talk rationally and be calm. As a result, I was treated like a close minded person that can't see over what 'corrupted people' (every doctor, scientist, pharmacist etc) tell me. 

At this point I just lost it and started shouting at her saying Naturopathy is a scam and that people that are selling her the chromotherapy pen are probably laughing at her for buying a 'magic' plastic pen for a ridiculous price etc. She is now very upset and is avoiding me.


So am I the asshole for shouting at my mother that Naturopathy is a scam?",False,False
0,"WIBTA if a difficult family history makes me not want to reach out after a death? | I spent the first 20 years of my life aware that I had four siblings (from my dad’s first marriage) but I never knew them due to issues they had with my parents and me by extension. Because of that, we were estranged.

Two sisters live in Florida, and when I was 20 (four and a half years ago) my dad started rekindling his relationship with the them. To show support for that, I did as well. I never felt comfortable, because of the history, but I tried my best to be as sisterly as an only child could be.

Last summer our father died. Before the wake even happened, my sisters, brother and I went to dinner and other than “hello,” the first thing my oldest sister said to me was: “his money should be split between the five of us.” That rubbed me the wrong way but I moved forward because I thought that dad would be excited to see all of his kids together getting along.

About a month, maybe two months, after he was buried (September/October), this same sister posted on Facebook about how her ex husband wasn’t treating all of his kids equally, and she went on to rant about how her “biological father” treated only one of his kids well and ignored the rest. I have proof of letters, cards, etc he sent them asking to see them/talk to them that they blatantly ignored (they were adults when I was born). She continued to rant and just talked a lot of crap about my dad which really upset me for a few reasons: 1, as I just stated he didn’t throw them away, and 2, he wasn’t there to be able to defend himself against her nasty words; he was the best dad. 

That night, I made the choice to cut off ties with all of my siblings for good. I was tired of getting upset about their BS constantly. Shortly after this, the same sister emailed my mother stating that she believes my mom is entitled to ZERO of my father’s life insurance money/unpaid salary/etc because they divorced and that money should be split among his five children. My dad did not have a will, but his job informed us it was all left to my mom in trust for me. I initially wanted to send all four of my siblings some of the money, but that left a very sour taste in my mouth after my mom had set up all of the funerary arrangements so they didn’t have to. We haven’t spoken since.

I am still friends with some of my nieces/nephews on Facebook because my problem is not with them. I saw that my oldest sister’s son died this week. I saw that they created a gofundme page, so I donated because I want to help and he’s still my nephew, despite me not knowing him at all. But I don’t want to be in contact with her (or the rest of them for that matter) because they have been deliberately greedy and rude for most of the time I’ve known them and I made a promise to myself not to contact them again after what was said about my dad.

1,"AITA for suing a trivia contest? | About a week ago, this group held a trivia contest in our local community theater, I think the group is some kind of charity fundraising group, not sure I just saw the ad on Facebook . I like trivia, so I signed up. It was kind of like jeopardy, but not on TV. It was for 500 bucks, whoever won. I had to take a quiz first, but I did get put on. Me against 5 other people.

Anyway, at the end, I did pretty well. First place tie with another guy. The tiebreaker was a question for the 2 of us. They played a voice sample of a character and we had to guess who it was. I knew the voice right away. So I buzzed in.

I said Mr. Anderson. That's who it was, but they said o was wrong. Then my opponent buzzed in and said Hank Hill. He was right and got the money, I got a stupid gift card to some restaurant I don't ever eat at. I tried explaining to the mc but he said he had to go by what was on the card. (If you don't know, Mr. Anderson is from beavis and butthead, Hank hill is from king of the hill, they're both voiced by the same guy and he uses the same voice for both characters).

I tried contacting the company and everything but they didn't respond. So I talked to a lawyer and am threatening to take them to small claims coart for cheating me out of money.

0,"AITA for asking to adopt my sisters baby? | Sorry for any weird wording, English isn’t my first language

My husband and I have had a lot of conception issues (2 miscarriages and a stillborn baby) 

My sister who is 25 got pregnant and is thinking of putting the baby up for adoption. She knows my husband and I have been looking to adopt and have been in contact with an adoption agency (very little luck) and asked if I could share the information. After discussion with my husband I decided to ask if we could adopt her baby.

When we asked her, she told us it would be too hard to see him at family events and called us very selfish to even ask.

Our parents agree that asking to adopt her baby is selfish and she wouldn’t be able to handle seeing the baby she gave up at Christmas and such.

0,"WIBTA for kicking my mentally ill sister out because she’s so messy? | My (26f) sister (28f), Jen, has been living with me for a few months now. 

She quit her job and uni in the past couple years, however resumed uni again recently and takes one class at a time. This was due to pretty severe depression and probably other issues (drinking heavily, major mood shifts) but she’s never been diagnosed because every time we try to get her professional help, she isn’t receptive and it always hits a dead end.

For a while, my parents were paying Jen’s rent (they are financially pretty comfortable), but eventually it still became too much and we decided the best thing to do would be to have her move in with me, in my guest room. They still give her enough for basic living expenses, and started sending me a small monthly amount in place of her paying rent/bills. 

The thing is, my sister is a slob- i get this is an effect of her severe depression, but she also won’t follow through with help we continue to try and get her, so I’m a bit fed up. 

When I say slob, I don’t just mean clothes in a pile. She eats in her room and leaves the food out for weeks. I have found rotting food in every corner of the room, including THE CLOSET. There’s countless carpet stains. Trash, empty bottles of liquor and clothes everywhere. 

We’ve had arguments about this and I’ve given Jen many several chances to stop trashing my home. Her depression is always the excuse, and I get that it can be a reason for letting everything go, however the fact she still is resisting help for it just makes this more frustrating. 

I told my parents I’m considering kicking her out, and they begged me to reconsider, saying she “needs” me and she can’t go live with them as they’re in a retirement community. They pointed out that she isn’t well and I should really just stick this through, that anything else would make me an awful sister (and an asshole). 

So, WIBTA? 

tl;dr my sister has severe depression and had to move in with me. She is absolutely trashing the room I’ve been letting her stay in (rotting food and trash everywhere). I want to kick her out but wonder if I would be TA due to her issues; my parents certainly think I would be.",False,False

For the past few weeks, my bf(24m) and I(24f) have taken to scaring the shit out of each other. If you scream, you owe the other person dinner or a back massage or other things like that. Pretty simple game. I've gotten my bf pretty damn good a bunch of times but he's only made me scream about 3 times and hasn't again for about 2 and a half weeks. He makes me jump, but not scream and he gets really sad when his plans don't work. And I honestly hate seeing him like that because I know he's trying his best, I'm just not easily spooked. Soo a few days ago when he scared me, I gave him a scream and my God did he look so damn proud of himself that he got me. But I felt bad about it and I spilled the beans after dinner and he looked so sad. He reassured me that he wasn't mad or anything because he's let me win before in other games but some friends I confided in said that I was kinda a dick for tricking him like that. Was I wrong to let him think he won?",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my gf I wouldn't stay with her if she got pregnant and brought it to term? | So my best friend just called a few hours ago to tell me that his gf was pregnant. It wasn't planned and according to him they were both on birth control. He is happy with it though, so I'm happy for him too. My gf was sitting next to me when he called, so she heard as well (my friend knew).   
After talking about it for a bit, she asked me what I'd do. I simply told her that children are not part of my plan (at least not yet), something she already knew. I hoped that would be it but she asked ""what would you do if it still happened?""  
Well damn, I knew she doesn't want to hear the answer from the way she asked, but whatever, if you force me to...  
I told her that my company (founded recently) and my career come first, I won't let anything get in the way of that. Wouldn't want to end up having lived for someone else during my best years and realize I wasted my life without ever doing what I love in the end.  
""What if I'd still keep it?""  
Fine with me, that's her choice, but it is mine to walk away. Sure, she'd get money (that is if I still had any - might be well off in a few years, might be completely bankrupt), but until this runs itself, I'm not even thinking about taking responsibility for a child.

And of course she did not like that and freaked out on me how I could be so heartless (yeah, empathy is not my strongest suit. Yet another reason not to have a child) and if I didn't care if my child would grow up fatherless. AITA here?",False,False
0,"AITA for wanting a kid free bed? | My boyfriend and I bought a bed 2 years ago. This bed stays at his house. I usually stay over at his place on the weekends, but most of the week I’m at my place. 

His daughter (9) is a total daddy’s girl. She often sleeps in the bed nights I’m not over. 

It’s gotten to the point where if I come over, she throws a fit and wants to leave to her mom’s because she knows she can’t sleep in the bed. Lately, the fits have gotten out of control. I don’t want to feel bad about sleeping in the bed that I purchased. 

I had mentioned to my bf about 4 weeks ago that maybe if she wasn’t allowed to sleep in the bed, even if I’m not there, that I wouldn’t be in this awkward spot. Last week after one of her fits, I told my boyfriend I’d prefer her not to sleep in the bed because it’s such an issue when she can’t. He agreed.

I wasn’t over last night, and she slept in her bed. Fast forward to now. My bf just dropped the kids off at their mom’s house and he went off on me about how he had a 9 year old cry on him for 45 minutes because of MY wishes and how upset it made him.

1,"AITA for not wanting my wife to pursue a career that would allow her to make more than me? | I know the title sounds really bad, but it's not that clear-cut. 

My wife and I are fairly young (late 20's). I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. 
While I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.

Her parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.

I thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.

The real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels ""good enough"" for a woman that he makes less than.

0,"AITA for accidentally having a non-religious wedding ceremony? | My wife (29 F) and I (30 M) got married last week Saturday. Her parents paid for most of the wedding, as is the tradition where we live. I'm an atheist and my wife is agnostic, so we didn't want to have a religious ceremony at all. Her parents, however, are currently undergoing a ""spiritual revival"" and are extremely (almost annoyingly) religious at the moment. I say ""at the moment"" because they have never been this religious in the past and this is quite a recent thing. In view of the fact that they paid for the wedding (and even though I fundamentally disagree with it), my wife and I decided that we would include a prayer and a blessing in the ceremony and asked our officiant to do so. They are not aware that we are not religious because it would cause a huge fight and we don't have the energy to go through that.

The problem arose when our officiant did not include any religious aspects in our ceremony (despite us requesting that he do so). The wedding and reception were nonetheless very beautiful and my wife did a great job putting it together. My wife's parents seemed fine the whole night. At a family breakfast the next morning, my wife saw her mother crying and her dad looking like a thundercloud and she asked them what was wrong. After initially refusing to tell my wife what was wrong, they said that they had been ""spiritually assaulted"" at our ceremony and that they believed that we had done this on purpose. They wanted to wait until December to discuss it with us!! 

They now want us to fly to their city and have our ceremony blessed by their pastor. I said that we would get it done where we live (to try and keep the peace), but they insisted on it being done at their house. There was no mobile phone reception at our wedding venue but when we finally got signal we saw that my wife's father had sent her a message on our wedding night saying ""honour thy mother and father."" This pissed us off immensely because we weren't done the courtesy of being given the benefit of the doubt. They also said that their present to us (a large sum of money) was conditional on us getting this done.

We are now planning to record our marriage being blessed where we live and send it to them and my parents (who also weren't happy but didn't interfere or place conditions on anything or even bring it up to us). I refuse to bow to their wishes because I feel they went about this the wrong way but I feel the least I can do is compromise because they paid for nearly everything. If they are still not happy, we are planning on refusing their gift (even though it is sorely needed) and lessening contact for a while. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for being upset that my partner wants us to get separate beds? | Basically we just moved in together less than 2 months ago and my partner is blaming not being able to sleep in the new house on having to share a bed with me. He's never been in a relationship or lived with someone before now and I think that he just needs to give it some time so he can get used to the new space and sharing a bed with someone but he thinks the solution is that we sleep in separate rooms. This really has me feeling hurt because the best part of my day is waking up beside him and being able to snuggle up before work and I just feel like he isn't giving it a chance. The other part is that the spare room isn't a spare room it's my lab where I work on all my biology experiments and do my writing and there is no room for a bed there without me giving up my hobbies and there is one other room but it's his office and he isn't willing to give it up for the extra bed and is putting it on me... I think the solution here is to give it some more time for things to settle and maybe to get him a pair of earplugs.

1,"WIBTA for lying to my brother for the rest of our lives about having a disorder? | My brother who is 2 years younger than me has Aspberger's. We have known for years but it's not something that we talk about in my family because my brother is embarrassed of it in a way. He is EXTREMELY smart and always has been. He excels in math and physics and everything in between. He is going to college and taking hard classes that he does well in. Lately, he has been depressed. More than depressed. A couple of months ago, he tried to take his own life by getting drunk and swallowing a bottle of acetaminophen. He and I are extremely close and he only talks to me. He called me in a panic hours after doing this and I took him to the hospital. He went to outpatient treatment after getting discharged from inpatient. The nurse had called me and asked if my brother was diagnosed with autism ever because he shows some clear signs. I talked to my brother about it today and he is still somewhat denying that he has autism.

My brother loves me to death and I love him just as much. He has always looked up to me. I can't imagine a world without him. He loves how much more alike we get as we get older. He constantly says it with a big smile on his face. I have tried to talk to him about his autism and how he shouldn't be ashamed and he should own that about himself because some people don't even realize he has bad communication skills and he's so damn smart. Occasionally, his bad communication skills are very apparent and his disorder is obvious in other ways as well. I try to tell him that people say Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs have Aspberger's but it doesn't do much for him when I say that. I feel if I tell my brother I have Aspberger's as well he would learn to love it and not deny it anymore, possibly helping himself.

A few years ago we were eating out and got our food to go. I'm not sure why I did this, but I the idea came over me to pretend that her diet coke was my regular and vice versa. I acted very confident about which was which. She kept on taking sips between the two and insisting that they were how she thought, and she started getting frustrated. By then I realized I was too far in and had to play it straight or else she'd get mad at me. This went on for longer than I expected it to but I had to commit to it and just insist she was being weird. In the end I drank her diet coke and she threw out her regular, pretty obviously still confused.

Every now and again she would bring it up and ask if I was pranking her and I would just maintain that she was being a weirdo that time and that I'm sure that I was right. I admit I did this for so long for the purpose of saving my own skin, because she's known to overreact to stuff.

This last Saturday night we got together with some friends and had a few drinks and she challenged me on this in front of them. I told her the truth and at the time she laughed about it with everyone and acted like this big mystery cokegate coming to light was so hilarious. 

Since then, however, she has repeatedly pouted about it and told me that she's angry that I only admitted it because we were in front of people rather then when she wanted to know. I specifically waited until we were in front of people so they she wouldn't have a blow up and would see the funny side of this. My defense here is that she is someone who can't take a joke at her expense and I absolutely would have told her much sooner if I thought she could.

So me and my gf are both university students. Obviously this comes with tests and assignments and all that good stuff. The problem is that she never EVER studies for them. Never. It’s kind of astonishing how she made it here In the first place without studying. Like she’ll have a test and be really freaked out about it and just. Won’t. Study. She has ADHD and takes Medication (vyvanse) for it, if that matters. She’s also convinced that she has a learning disability like dyslexia or something else. I advised her to go to therapy and/or a psychiatrist if that’s what she really thinks but no matter how much I push her, which I only do because she keeps bringing it up, she doesn’t go and so her situation doesn’t get better. She always asks me for advice with studying, because I have ADHD too, and I give her study tips and ways to make studying effective but she honestly never listens to me.

So yesterday, I was at work for a lot of the day and when I got back to her place she was freaking out, and I asked her what’s wrong. And she said she has a test tomorrow and she’s not at all prepared for it. I was flabbergasted, she’s been at home all day (she doesn’t have class Tuesday’s and Thursday’s). I asked her what she did all day and she says she spent it watching Netflix. She called herself a “big retard” and “fucking stupid” , not in a self-deprecating way, and asked me for advice again and I just kind of gave a sigh And she got defensive and asked what she did wrong. And I said to her, “look, If I’m being honest I don’t really want to give you any advice because it’ll be the same as what I always say, and it’ll be the same advice that you always choose to ignore. At a certain point, all it boils down to is that you have to Actually want to succeed, and put yourself in a position to succeed. You should also stop calling yourself stupid and a retard because it’s a self-perpetuating cycle and eventually if you say it to yourself enough times then you’ll actually believe it.” 

She started crying and had a full blown breakdown, and she says she feels I insinuated that she’s being lazy. But that’s not the case, I’m just fatigued because it’s like having to deal with someone who doesn’t want to succeed and then acts shocked when they fail.

Few months later I start to finally make progress, get my own place all on my own, dad ends up in hospital from mixing alcohol and pills. 

I pay for almost the entire $5k deductible, brother and his wife reluctantly pay $1k cause I literally can’t have more money come out of my account at once. 

Am there in hospital after work every single day despite my very, very unstable mom (they’re divorced but lived together) being there, when he’s out I call out of work and drive 6 hours to get him to the rehab falling asleep driving, drive back, have to go in and get his belongings while dealing with mom who is aggressive saying she’ll call the police on ME when she has no right to be there, have to come back three times to get more of his stuff, same things happen, have multiple breakdowns in car after seeing her. 

Take care of all of his bills, break his lease for him, he calls every day to make sure I’m on top of paying his stuff. Incredibly stressful two months taking care of me and him when I was just able to take care of me, but no one else is helping him.

He helped with a couple hundred for rent and says he can’t afford his own place so i say he should find a roommate and he gets offended and says I just want him out of my hair and he does not want a roommate. 

The only reason I’d want him to stay is so he can save money to start paying me back and help with rent since I spent my savings on him but it is so awkward and cramped and uncomfortable. He’s recovered and is sober and it’s good to have a dad and have him back to normal but i feel ive done more than enough when he did nothing for me in the darkest time of my life.

Just had a pretty big blowout with the wife and my kids, and need some perspective. To be clear, my wife is an amazing mother and person, and I respect and love her more than anything. 

I am home now for obvious reasons, but typically am only home 1-2 weekends a month about 10 months out of the year. For 1-2 months I’m working from home. This is usually during summer time or I can do it so I’m home all nov/Dec, which also works out well for the family as kids aren’t at school for the most part. 

I have 6 kids: 16f , 15m , 11 year old twins both girls, 9m and 7m. My wife has not worked since our second child was born, which we both prefer. 

I have never worried too much about how she runs things when she’s home with the kids, which is mostly all the time. I worry about big picture stuff and how the kids are doing, but routine and day to day things I stay out of her way and trust her completely to handle that unless I’m asked for input. 

Now that I’m home, I am noticing some things I don’t care for. Some examples: 
- the twins are incredibly bossy to the younger boys. 6 months ago, twins and 9yr old were inseparable but now they act like their 16 year old sister. Wife is not bothered by this 
-  15 year old seems to think the entire basement is his domain and doesn’t want anyone else going down there while he plays video games. Wife makes no effort to curb this
- 7yr old recently celebrated 3 years being cancer free and naturally is a little behind for his age. He’s all caught up in school and pretty close to on par developmentally, but socially is cripplingly attached to his mother and 16yr old sister. No effort has been made by my wife to push him socially. 

The fight stems from this last issue. He was excused by his teacher from participating in a zoom call with classmates per wife’s request, and I expressed I didn’t think that was best for him long term. It turned into a huge argument and other points above were also brought up. 

So, AITA for being worried about these things?",False,False
1,"AITA for asking TSA to let me and my young son into the gating area, without boarding passes, to watch airplanes take off? | My three-year-old son and I had some time to kill today, so we rode a train to the airport (he's at the age where he's obsessed with trains, trucks, airplanes, cars, etc.). When we got there, he wanted to see if we could watch airplanes land and take off. We couldn't see any from the windows in the ticketing and terminal areas. So I approached the TSA transportation security officer manning the place where they check your license. I showed him my license and he asked for my boarding pass. I stated that I did not have one and that we were just hoping to sit in the concourse and watch some airplanes take off and land. The TSA officer stated that I needed a boarding pass to be let into the part of the airport past the TSA security checkpoints. He then went further and stated that if I didn't have one and didn't plan to buy one, we needed to leave the airport immediately. So we left. 

I thought this was ridiculous. I showed my driver's license. And we would've gone through the usual TSA security theater (including us, there were maybe a dozen people in the airport, so it's not like we were holding anyone up).  And the risk of me somehow sneaking onto an airplane with my three-year-old and a stroller would've been very remote, given that airlines check your boarding passes a separate time before they let passengers board the plane. 

The only basis I can think of for TSA refusing us entry is that there's some federal statute or TSA regulation (or other TSA security procedure) requiring anyone who wants to be in the airport concourse to have a boarding pass on their person at all times, even if they just want to go there to buy a slice of Sbarro's pizza at the airport food court. But if there is, it's not like this TSA officer cited it, and it wasn't posted any of the walls in the area.

Since it's new, there were tons of people there, and it was hard to find an open spot to sit. After a bit of waiting, I managed to snag a spot at a communal table. However, my friend was planning on joining me, so I was keeping my eyes peeled for a solo table to open up so me and my friend could sit together. Eventually, a guy at a solo table in front of me started packing up his stuff, so I got ready and was planning to grab the table for me and my friend. As I was walking towards the table, another girl started walking towards it too. I put my stuff down. She interrupted me, saying she had been standing waiting for the table to open up. I told her that I had been waiting for a table to open up too, and that she could have my old spot. She then said that she was there with her boyfriend and they needed a solo table so they could sit together, and they had been waiting for that spot. I awkwardly told her that it was first come first serve, and that I had also been trying to get a solo table because I had a friend who was coming to join me. She rolled her eyes at me and started to walk away. A girl at another solo table piped up and said that she would move, and that the couple could take her table. The girl whose spot I had stolen declined this offer. Then the girl at the solo table gave me a dirty look. I feel so uncomfortable and bad now. I know it must suck to stand and wait for a table and have someone take it in front of your eyes, but in my defense, I didn't see her and I was also waiting for a solo table to open up so I could sit with my friend.

0,"AITA for wanting my mom to delete an audio recording she took of me coming out? | Long time lurker. First time posting. I'll try not to turn this into a wall of text.

I (F19) have been sort of going over in my head whether or not I should tell my mom about the fact that I like girls. She grew up in a very cult like setting where they were pretty much against anything and everything fun because someone did something in the Bible so don't do it or enjoy hell - they were not Christians, they were something way more fanatic so I'm not coming down on Christians. Anyway, she's said several times in the past that she would wonder where she went wrong or feel like a failure of a parent if I ""turned out gay."" But I knew this wasn't really her talking, but more of that cult talking so I never hated her for saying it.

Anyway, finally decided one afternoon to tell her that a recent outing with a ""friend"" off Bumble was more than that. I teared up, and became a lot more vulnerable than I usually am. I mean, it's a pretty scary situation. I thought she was going to look at me different. But she keeps texting on her phone and says, ""That's fine."" She was a bit more nonchalant about how upset I was than I cared for, but later she said she was trying not to make me nervous by looking at me the whole time so whatever. 

Anyway, something we like to do is go in each other's social media accounts and post something to throw off our friends. So while she was napping, I came up, unlocked her phone, and was about to go on her Facebook when I decided to check out audio recordings. Sometimes, she'll record us when we're reading a bad book or a bad movie to catch all the jokes we make and how much we laugh. So I click it thinking it's one of those until I skip ahead and hear myself crying and coming out to her not one week ago. I immediately wake her up and ask her why she did this. She says because it was, quote, ""a pivotal moment, or whatever."" 

I ask her to delete it. Telling her I was unusually vulnerable than I've ever been. She takes her phone, locks it with a new code, and refuses for no other reason beyond what was said above, saying I was being ridiculous. So now I don't know if I really am being. My friend says I have a right to be angry and that it's a violation of privacy. But I don't know.

This happened over the weekend, when she didn’t work and I did. I got home from work a little after 5 and she and my mom were drinking wine and talking on the couch. When I came through the door my sister immediately stopped talking. Only my mom said hi to me or even seemed to care I was home. 

When I came up after getting changed, I went to pour myself some wine that was on the counter that they were drinking. My sister rudely said “Excuse me that’s mine. Please ask before you take.” Like I was somehow supposed to automatically know it was hers. My parents don’t care if I take their alcohol. I decided not to bother with the wine and went to sit in the living room with them where they were whispering. 

When my sister noticed I was settling in, I heard her say to my mom “I’m going to go okay. Well finish later.” And she started to leave the room.

I admit I got angry. I don’t know why she hates my presence so much and why she had to leave just because I came up. I said as much, kind of yelling “You don’t have to fucking leave the room just because I’m home. I had a long day at work and I would appreciate company and venting too. Finish your conversation.”

0,"AITA For killing my sister’s pet mouse? | Hello Reddit 

I’ll get right to it. My sister got a pet mouse last month for her birthday gift. While I am absolutely terrified of mice, since I did get bit by one as a kid, my sister would constantly bring the mouse to me, unannounced. (Such as when I was in my bedroom, or even when I ate dinner) 

Last Friday, it was in the morning. My sister decided to come into my room with the mouse, but I guess since I was still sleeping, she decided to wake me up and show me it. She placed the mouse on my pillow beside my face, and then woke me up. Once I was awake, I saw the mouse and almost had an heart attack. I picked up my pillow and threw it at away from me, which then hit the wall on the opposite side of my room. (My room is kinda small) With the mouse still on the pillow. The head of the mouse cracked/came opened, and he died.  My sister began crying saying that I was the one who killed her mouse. My parents got mad at me, and since Friday they literally haven’t talked to me. When I try and ask them something, they pretend I’m not even there.

For the vast majority of my speaking life, I have said ""Hey"" as a greeting. Hello is used for the phone, opening my door to delivery drivers, and when speaking in a professional atmosphere like a meeting (retail management, not board room). I never say Hi. I just don't. I don't know why. It feels awkward to make myself say it 

In the last few months my 35 year old husband has decided that it annoys him that I say ""hey"" to the point that he must say something. Meeting him at the door when he comes home for work? Can't say ""hey!"" because he gets upset. Why? Because he says it's rude. Tells me it's disrespectful.

I am not yelling HEY! to get his attention. I'm using it to greet him and use a friendly tone.

In the 3 decades I've used the word, not a single person has ever been offended by it, or at least never bothered to tell me it was offensive. I've googled it, and nothing suggests it's disrespectful. In fact, most people seem to use it when greeting someone who's known more intimately than just an acquaintance. Growing up, it was used all the time.

1,"AITA for not giving my girlfriend the profits from a watch she gave me? | My girlfriend's dad died 4 years ago. It's taken some time but she decided she was ready to get rid of some of his stuff. 
She was getting rid of some of his clothes and told me to take anything I fancied before it went to the charity shop. 

In the box were lots of his clothes but also a box with his military dog tags and watches from when he was in the army, some coins too. I told her and she quickly realised and took the dog tags and coins out as she wanted to keep them. 
There were 3 watched in the box and I asked if I could have the gold watch. She said sure and I took it along with a belt and necklace. 

A few months passed and the watch broke. I took it to a shop to be fixed and the guy said it was super valuable and actually worth over £300+ if fully functional. He checked it out and offered me the £300 there and then. 
I was at a hard point in my life and had car insurance due, rent due and money owed to a credit card and my MOT due. I took him up on the offer and then excitedly rang my girlfriend to tell her. 

At first, she got mad and said I better get it back and that she didn't give it me to sell it. I said that it was being given away anyway and she said that no, the clothes were to be given away but when she realised she had the box of dog tags and watches was in there, she took it out and only gave me that watch because it was me who asked. 

I said that I was sorry for the misunderstanding but that what's done is done and I can't just go and get it back because the guy will sell it for a profit, not just to sell back to me for what he bought it. She asked how much I got, I said £300 and she screamed at me and said it was worth way more than £1,000. I checked this later and in fact it's worth around £800-900. 

She then said if I'd sold it then she wanted at least some of the money. I said I'd already booked my MOT and paid off my credit card. She cried and said I'm an asshole. We spoke the next day and she said she was genuinely reconsidering our relationship.

1,"AITA for ignoring my[27m] girlfriend[26f] for a week? | I’ve been dating this amazing girl for 6 months now. Due to recent events, I have not seen her for a month now since we leave an hour away. 

Just as some background, me and her both suffer from depression. When winter rolled around I told her there were times where I might just need a day or two to myself, where I don’t talk to anyone. She understood and says she may do the same. So far it’s happened twice, once when I needed a day and once when she needed a day. 

On Saturday, I woke up aggravated and agitated. I have a history of anger issues and when I texted my GF in the morning I told her how I was feeling. She told me to take the day and we can talk later that evening. I was happy with that since I was afraid of taking my anger out on her. 

Well the feeling didn’t go away. I texted her later that night and thanked her for the space and we said our good nights. 

After that my week got worse. From Saturday to today I was dealing with more bad news on top of more bad news. I’m not going to get into the specifics, but it’s wiped me out. 

I know my girlfriend has trust issues, so for the first few days we at least said good night to each other and that was it. On the fourth day, she sent me a message saying she was worried about me and it would help her if I checked in so she knew I was alright. I won’t lie, my message was short. I said that my week was horrible and I want to be left alone. I personally didn’t think it was her place to be worried about me. 

The next day she only texted me good night, but I couldn’t even bring myself to respond to her. The next day she didn’t even send me a good night. 

Today I finally reached out to her and let her know I was ready to talk. She told me that while she was happy that I’m ready to talk, that she does not want to listen to it if it’s about the week I had. She said that she had a terrible week, but she couldn’t just hide away like I did. I live alone and she lives with her family of 5 others. I know she deals with huge stresses from them and being as she can’t go to work, she’s been overwhelmed. 

She said that she had enough to deal with and that I had my chance to talk to her about this stuff while it was happening. She said she needs to be able to deal with her own sanity, and my silence gave her an anxiety attack but she knew she couldn’t reach out to me when it happened so she dealt with it on her own. 

I told her she knew what she was getting herself into. I had warned her about this kind of stuff. I’m a bit mad at her for blaming her anxiety attack on me and I told her that’s not my responsibility. She got angry and we haven’t talk since. I’m debating if I need to apologize or not.

As the date of said even got closer, management began dropping hints about the plan for the day. The day before, it turned out, there will be no hiking - they're taking us to a meat restaurant.

I'm vegan. And the manager knows that, because the previous ""fun"" activity the department did was a barbecue, in which I sat in front of an empty plate and drank coffee I brought from my desk. A pretty questionable way of spending the afternoon.

I asked if there will be vegan options. The manager laughed, and said ""Well, the beer is vegan, I think!"".

Which I found extra annoying, because I also don't drink, and that's not a secret either...

I notified the HR that I won't be attending after all, and will come to work as usual.

1,"AITA for giving a presentation at school which basically criticizes most people at the school? | So I (17M) am in a bit of a weird position. I'm not the bullied kid. I mean people tried to bully me once, but it just didn't work. I've always had a fierce confidence, so whenever someone tried to bully me and I bit back, they knew it was going to be too much headache and gave up. 

Nor am I a popular kid. Nor am I considered one of the ''normal'' types who just floats around going unnoticed.

I've always been told by girls that I'm good looking (have sharp jawline and go gym a lot), so looking at me, most people *think* that I'd be one of those popular types, but I just wasn't. I consciously decided *not* to be that stereotype - the fit and athletic jock who is a hit with everyone. I *could* have been that person like my older brother, but I chose not to. 

There's valid criticisms of me too - I'm arrogant, quick to assume and sometimes lack empathy, however I'm self aware and honest about it. 

This brings me to the presentation. In one of my classes, we were tasked with giving an individual presentation on a topic that is important to us - something that is *personal* to us. So of course most people gave topics on a range of issues; ranging from health issues, to societal issues, etc. 

My topic? I used this as a platform to criticize our school. Rather than take aim at the system , I took aim at my school specifically. I didn't name anyone in particular, however I did broadly criticize certain groups. Noone was safe - teachers, jocks, cheerleaders, criticized.

Essentially, my presentation said the following:

- The teachers at the school are lazy and unhelpful. For the most part, they don't pay attention much and seem unbothered in class. 

- Many of the girls, especially those who cheerlead (but also those who do not) are too obsessed with social media. My main point here was shallowness. Both guys and girls are shallow, but our school has a bad reputation for instagram wannabes. I said that perhaps those who cheerlead should focus more on academics, and less on empty validation

- Many of the athletes would benefit from being better role models. They are in a position of great responsibility, and yet our town has had multiple instances of these jocks drunk driving and causing damage. There is a high correlation with our school's jocks and drunk driving incidents

- Many on the debate team and choir should seek help for their mental health. This wasn't an indictment of them, but me standing up for them

The school is a bit clique-y, moreso than other schools I've seen. But **I specifically backed up my presentation with evidence - mainly with statistics and my opinion, backed with some philosophy.**

The teacher was not happy, but he did not get me in trouble. In fact, I was surprised that he said it was really thoughtful. The other students mostly pissed off.

This woman was trying to get off as soon as the plane touched down, despite being at the very back and taking up all the aisle space. She was already arguing with the flight attendant, when she made some kind of motion and inadvertently smacked me in the face. Not hard, barely even stung, but I was already tired and fed up with her. When I get on planes, I make an attempt to not interact with anyone, even the people I fly with. I either sleep or listen to music. I get a drink from the flight attendant once or twice, and that's all the talking I do in an 8 hour flight. 

Well, I got up, squeezing by the lady and started telling her to shut up. (The woman wasn't fat, but she was partially blocking my aisle, so I couldn't have gotten right up anyway) Yeah, I know, I could have started off with a nicer choice of words, but my tone wasn't hostile. It was more like ""can you please just shut up and go back to your seat? You'll be off the plane in <30 minutes"". This lady, who we can call B (you know why) directed her attention to me, and started telling me that I'm being an asshole to her and I'm ruining her flight. 

That set me off, and I called her a few names. A loose paraphrase of the conversation follows:

M (me): I'm not ruining anything.

B: You're causing a scene and blocking the aisle

M: Shut up you idiot, I'm just telling you to go back to your seat. 

B: I have a child, I need to leave first, in case he needs to potty. (I remember she did use the word ""potty"")

M: Use the plane bathroom you dumb bitch!

FA: Both of you need to sit down, and we can begin deplaning

I sat down after, already fuming, and when we were getting off, she was grabbing her bag from the overhead, complaining about her ""treatment"" when I walked by. I dropped a comment under my breath, ""Idiot"" and started walking away. She caught up to me in the terminal, out of breath and looking pretty angry. She argued with me up until my parents saw me, and came over to greet me. They asked if I had gotten a new girlfriend, when I answered with

""No, just some moron I was on the plane with.""

Well, we left, and she nearly followed us to my parent's car, and when we started driving, I got a long lecture about being nice to other people. I recounted it in my defense, but they said my comments are ""unjustified"" and ""Totally unacceptable"".

If in the future, the parents get to know about this they will be really disappointed. Let alone the ethnicity the guy is even of a different religion. The chances of them working out will be 0/10. When she deleted her post, before that i message her asking “Why is this guy so close to you” to which she replies “who”.

I see this as potentional  bonding time.

I'd pay for my son to go, I'd also give them *both* spending money.

Anyway, after maybe 11 months of no contact, she asks me how I am, and if I wanna do something sometime. I say yes, assuming it's a date type thing, and we hang out. It's nothing special, and a bit boring tbh, but towards the end I feel enough chemistry to put my arm around her.

She brushes my arm off and tells me this was only a ""friend thing"", and that she's interested in a nother guy. I decide to be honest and i tell her that i don't want any contact in that case, and that I can't be bothered putting in the effort if this is just gonna be a platonic thing. 

I tell her it's not personal, I just don't see any real point or anything to be gained from it, going for being brutally honest here. We say good bye on a pretty sour note, though I'm not that concerned.

So as we went past a maccas, I told him I was hungry and could I quickly grab an egg McMuffin in the drive through, and he said yes. As we drove off and I started to eat it, he wound down the windows a bit without saying anything but I didn’t take much notice. I then asked him a random question and he gave me a snarky response. I asked him what was wrong and he said it was inconsiderate of me to have complained about being hungry and then gotten food when he obviously would have been hungry and not allowed to eat, especially because it smelled so strong in the car. I asked him why he said yes to us going through the drive through and he said he’s not going to tell me I can’t eat. I asked him if he expected me to fast with him and he said no but I could have made the effort to get up earlier and eat while he was in the shower or another room so it wasn’t tempting for him.

It didn’t smell but did look so gross and I wasn’t expecting it on a well groomed woman like her. So I guess I gave an expression that was funny when I saw it, and later that night she heard me and some others talking about how disgusting she is.

0,"AITA if I cut off my brother and possibly my immediate family from my life? | Throwaway account because I don't want anyone to recognize me. I have a twin brother it always felt like people talked about me and him as if we were one unit. My brother has been a real big dick to me my entire life. He would bad mouth me to other people who wanted to be my friends, just so that they wouldn't. He talks so much crap about me, and it really upsets me. When we were little we moved houses quite a few times. Whenever we went to a new school he would either start rumors about me or he would blow up stories from our old schools out of proportion, that no one cared about before. He bad mouthed me so much that by the time high school came not many people wanted to be my friend. At that point I was like screw this, imma make sure I go to a different uni than him. And I did. I made tons of friends close friends and it was a blast. Then when I went back home for Christmas I was again reminded by his bullying. Particularly, one of my closest friends in Hs just turned against me at some point joining that crowd of hating me. Even when we were little, if he ever got bullied I would always stand up for him. But it was never reciprocative l. He has been taunting me for so long. I talked to my parents about this. But it's getting too much, they think I'm overreacting, and that he is supposedly more of a brother type only because he helped me in school a little bit. Which was very very minor. I just want to live my life in peace have a normal life and a normal social life. I don't want to be pulled back into a severe depression because of his taunting. Idk if it's the right thing to do.

1,"AITA for not ending my friendship with my best friend after he cheated on my sister? | Both my best friend and my sister know about my other account so this is a throwaway.

I'm an 18 year old guy and I have a twin sister. I've been best friends with my best friend (we'll call him G) since kindergarten, so G and my sister have always been pretty close too. They've kind of had a ""thing"" going on our whole lives. For the longest time, they never officially dated for a bunch of different reasons I won't get into, but they were always really close and really into each other.

A little over a year ago, when we were all 17, they finally started dating. Everything went really well for like 13 months, but then long story short, G cheated on my sister and I was the one who figured it out. He swore it wouldn't happen again and begged me not to tell my sister but I told her anyway. I was mad at him and he was mad at me so we didn't talk for a month and a half, which was honestly the weirdest month and a half of my whole life. G's practically like my brother, we've been inseparable since kindergarten, so not having him around was kinda....unbearable honestly lol

After our streak of not talking to each other, G invited me on his family ski trip as a way to make amends (I've been on lots of his family's ski trips through the years). I accepted and ended up forgiving him and letting him back into my life because it was way too weird without him in it. I can tell he's genuinely sorry about what happened. He literally cried cause he felt so bad and I've only seen him cry like once before in my whole life

Anyway, G and my sister broke up as soon as she found out he cheated and they're still not on speaking terms, so my sister obviously isn't happy about the whole situation. She's making me feel like shit for still being friends with G, and she doesn't seem to understand how big of a deal it would be for us to lose our 13 year friendship over her. I know G made a huge mistake, I hate him for it and I'll never 100% get over it, but I'm not gonna let it ruin my best and longest friendship. I think about it like this: if your best friend cheated on their SO and then felt like shit, would you end your friendship with them? No. So why is this any different just because his SO happened to be my sister? G and I are going to the same college in the fall (a different college in a different state than the one my sister's going to), so none of this is gonna be something that we even think about when we're living in different places

She made an assumption that I was the one who blocked him, and while I did, it's indicative of problems in the relationship.

0,"AITA for using my boyfriend's phone? | My (34m) boyfriend (33m) and I have been together for ages, we're practically married, and we live together. He happens to have a really great phone and I have some piece of crap that serves the purpose and I don't feel the need to replace it. Sometimes, when we're at home and I don't feel like turning on the computer, I ask him if I may use his phone (for watching YouTube, going on Reddit or Instagram, just googling stuff...) and he lets me. Sometimes I don't even ask because he lets me every time, and he's right there, he sees it, and never reacts.

He also has a folder of our pictures which I sometimes go to. So none of the other folders, just that one with our photos together.

We recently had friends over and they saw me do this. Nobody said anything there and then, but the next day, two of them sent me a group message and asked me what the fuck. I said that I'd asked him and he let me, so what's the big deal. But they said: Of course he let you! You shouldn't have asked in the first place! That's like an unwritten rule that you don't go through your partner's things. He probably feels pressured to give you his phone because you're a couple.

I tried to justify myself, but they just called me an asshole and told me I need to stop RIGHT NOW. I said I doubt there is anything on his phone he'd be worried about me finding, and they said that of course there is nothing, because he knows I'll be touching his phone.

So now I'm confused. I never heard of this unwritten rule, and I think that if he didn't want me to use his phone, he'd say so. Also, I don't understand what exactly he's supposed to have on his phone that he might not want me to find. I'm fairly certain he isn't cheating on me, and I see all the dick pics he takes because he sends them to me anyway.

0,"AITA for deciding to cut ties with my mum? | I’ll try and keep this brief..

Mum divorced dad when I was ~10, lost contact with my much older sister when I was ~12 and again with my slightly older sister when I was ~15. “It’s all their faults and they’re assholes”.

Mum doesn’t deal well with any of this, going out on weekends and coming home after midnight, locking herself in her room, bringing random guys home, crying a lot.

When I’m 20 I meet my (now) wife and have a baby with milk intolerance (followed by 2 other children within next 4 years). Mum reports me to social services for neglect (“not feeding first child properly”). They find no problems but we now have a red marker so my wife can no longer do teacher training or anything. All is forgiven after a few months as she apologised and says she won’t get involved. Admits at the time that she won’t get as attached to my younger 2 children because of the grief she suffered.

Children now 4, 6 and 8, I’m now 30. Mum still clearly favourites oldest child. She raged at me the other day for bullying my oldest child because she looks at me before answering questions such as can she have a second ice lolly at 9 in the morning because she knows she shouldn’t. Apparently she also seems “withdrawn” but no evidence of this except what mum says she sees. Child doing great at school socially and academically, enjoys after school clubs like dance and church club (like youth club at the church). Spoke to daughter privately and she says she thinks she’s my favourite (as do they all of course!).

I feel anxious every time I go round mums (twice a week) because I don’t want to upset her. She gets upset if I’m half an hour late or if I say they can’t have biscuits before lunch. I said to her at the start of her rage to drop it and not go there again. She just kept repeating I should be ashamed of myself and I’m a bully with no explanation. She says I’m “not worth the spit she could spit on me”.

She texts next day wanting to face time children and I say no. Would be going round tomorrow but clearly no intention to. She’s never supported me in any way only doubted me.

Difficult part for me is that she has nobody without my family and is now nearly 70 and has occasional vertigo (BPPV). Don’t want to leave her on her own. She’ll be depressed and possibly ill. Same time don’t want her in my life because constant judging, stress and anxiety.

We booked this really nice space that overlooks the skyline and plan to host from sunset to midnight. I’ve already bought string lanterns and candles for atmosphere and the theme is basically food, alcohol, and gorgeous night view of our city.

My sister (who’s going to be a bridesmaid) found out and asked me if we could reschedule the party for noonish. I asked her why and she said it’s because she doesn’t feel safe going into that part of the city at night, because that’s statistically where the most assaults on women happen.

I told her I can call one of my fiancé’s best friends who lived near her to pick her up and drive her over so she can go with him and his wife, and then I’ll personally drive her home after. But she said no, because she just doesn’t want to be in the city fullstop at night. She says dark alleys and alcohol and strange men make her anxious and there will be some combination of that at my party. I basically shrugged to this and said, fine, you can not come if you want but there’s 56 people coming already. I can’t change plans just for you.

Well I thought that was that but she told my mom and my aunts and now everyone is calling me an asshole and bridezilla for not accommodating my sister’s fears.

The last time I saw them he had said something ridiculous and while his father was lecturing him he said ""it's okay because (my name) laughed"" and my friends husband tone changed and we had to all sit there awkwardly while her kid got lectured. I felt bad because I don't know how to react to kids saying mildly bad stuff. (I forget that ""dumb"" and ""stupid"" are considered bad words)

Even worst is that these are considered our ""girls night"" together since her husband works till later in the evening she is stuck with the kids (don't even get me started on recommending a babysitter because I went down that road). Also, I guess years of being a mother has trained her to knock back a few drinks and still be in full control while I knock back the same amount and the lines of being a responsible adult in front of children and hanging out with my girlfriend become blurred.

0,"AITA for accepting payment for babysitting when I leave the kid alone? | I'm a student, and I work for an online tutoring service, where I get paid by the appointment (£10 per 30 minutes).

Students can request a 30 or 60 minute session. I put all my clients who want 30 minutes during weekdays, and I time the appointments so I have a 30 minute session, then a 30 minute break.

My sister wanted me to babysit my niece (11). This includes food, homework help, and generally making sure she has what she needs. We don't have any other family who can look after her and her dad isn't involved.

My sister wanted me to watch my niece on Tues-Thurs, for 4 or 5 hours at a time, from 3 until 7 or 8. She offered £5 an hour, and she's paid every time.

Weeks 1-3: I cancelled all sessions to watch Niece, and lost a lot of money.

Week 4: my sister told me that she didn't need me, so I kept all my appointments. Then around 1pm on Tuesday she texted that she did need my help tonight. I couldn't cancel - too short notice. I sat my niece down with dinner and homework and left her to it while I did 2 sessions on Tuesday and 4 on Wednesday. I cancelled Thursday. I apologised to my niece for leaving her on her own, and she said she was capable of taking care of herself, and that if I had any more appointments to be in then she would be alright on her own while I had them, as they're not very long.

Weeks 5-now: I haven't cancelled any. This means that of the 4 or 5 hours my niece is with me, she's alone for around half of the total time. I am always in the next room, and she can come and get me if she needs me. I've used my breaks (30 minutes every hour) to check in.

In this time I've also kept taking the £5 an hour from my sister. I usually end up spending whatever she gives me on my niece, whether that's in the form of buying food that she likes, bus fare, or whatever other expenses come with looking after her.

Last night my sister arrived half hour early, while I was on a session, and my niece told her I was on the laptop in the next room, and explained the whole setup.

My sister comes in while I am with a new client, and starts yelling at me. She says that she has asked me to watch my niece, and I am being paid to take care of her, and that I should have told her that Niece was unattended for half the time she was with me.

It was never a secret, and when my sister has previously asked what we did, I have said that I had a client, or clients, and she's never blinked twice on hearing the information.

My sister is now asking that I give back all the money she's given me for babysitting. This total is between £360-450. I no longer have this money as and I have no proper total of how much due to it being a mix of cash and online bank transactions.

I think my sister is overreacting, and I'm not just going to give her a few hundred and hope it's the right amount, but my sister clearly expected me to be with niece the whole time, so she's not getting what she paid for. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for posting pictures of what my step daughter really looks like to her social media account? | 
My wife and I have a deal with our kids, if they have social media:
1. we need to be able to follow the account 
2. We need all login information, and updates when the login changes. 

Although it’s required, we rarely check their social media. We would like them to behave themselves as if we are watching. 

Recently we found out that my wife’s daughter (16) has a secret Instagram account. The Instagram account has around nine thousand subscribers. The pictures that she posts on this account do not look like her *at all*. They are highly edited and quite inappropriate. She looks 25, not 16. 

Wife and I took the phone when we found out. We have since gone through her messages to see A LOT of inappropriate messages, and the fact that she has done two sponsored posts recently.  We took the phone for a while as we were trying to figure out an appropriate punishment. 

I suggested that the account be shut down, and she can’t have a new one for a couple of months. Wife didn’t agree. It honestly seems to me as if she was proud of this. She didn’t take it seriously at all, and was dilly dallying about coming up with a punishment. I thought I’d take matters into my own hands, so I posted a series of pictures of her where she actually looks like a kid. School pictures, family pictures etc. She lost a few followers over a couple of days. 

When I gave her the phone back she had a complete melt down. She is acting like I ruined her life. She is talking about how she may not be able to do the sponsored posts and she is being bullied. I told her she can always delete the account. Wife found out and got very angry with me. She even told me that this was not a parenting job for me and I should have left her to deal with it.

1,"AITA for not wanting to be a “role model” to my gay nephew? | I’m 27 and came out when I was 22. 

I never wanted it to be a big deal and I mostly ignored some of the hateful comments I got. 

I never wanted and still do not want to be part of the Pride movement. I just want to be able to live my life with my boyfriend. 

My older brother is currently overseas and has a son Aaron, who is 13, with his wife. When my brother is away I kind of step up and help out with Aaron when I can.

I picked up Aaron from school on Friday and he seemed more quiet than usual. I asked him what was going on and he told me that he needed to talk to me. 

He the proceeded to come out to me and told me that I was his “role model” and that I’m the only one who knows that he’s gay. 

I got uncomfortable but thanked Aaron for telling me and made an excuse about having to get to work.

I just have no interest in being a “gay role model” for any kid. It’s not something I ever wanted. Maybe this makes me selfish, but I came out for myself, not to be part of a movement. 

He texted me later that night thanking me for “being so cool about it.” 

I took some time and sent him the following message: 

“Thank you for telling me Aaron. While I understand why you would tell me, I don’t think I am the right person to support you through this.  Please go see your guidance counsellor at school or talk to The Trevor Project or a group like that. I am not entirely comfortable being a role model for you and I think you should look elsewhere for some support.”

I never received a response from him and when I talked to his mom today, she told me that he was upset all weekend but obviously she had no idea why he was so upset. 

I don’t think that I am the asshole generally in this situation as I never asked to be a role model and I don’t think I am required to take that on, but I don’t know if my message was a little to harsh with him.

0,"AITA for not wanting to let my roommate's friends (who are poor and are visiting here at great expense from the other side of the country to visit my roommate) live at our place for free for 2 weeks? | Short version/question: If you live in a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate, and one roommate has a friend visiting from out of town/a different state, how many days is it socially acceptable for said visitor to crash there before they have to leave? 

Long version/Context:

My roommate and I are friends and we get along great on almost everything else, but we vehemently disagree over this one issue. We're both in our early 30's and live in a small-ish but expensive 2 bedroom apartment in San Diego with a small common area. My roommate is originally from the East Coast and last December she told me she was having a friend from back home flying over here that would be staying over ""for Christmas.""

I didn't initially see a problem with this because I figured that if you say someone is coming over ""for Christmas"" meant that they would be here maybe 4 or 5 days. 

Well, as it turns out, my roommate's friend ended up staying and crashing at our place for 14 days, from December 15th until the 28th. This pissed me off, especially considering that I did not care for this friend at all and was mad about having a third person (whom I found annoying) staying at our home for free taking up our relatively small space for half a month.

After the friend finally left my roommate and I ended up arguing a bit and having a discussion about it, with me telling her that I thought it was absolutely egregious to have a guest over for that many days. In return she told me that in her experience if a guest was travelling across the country, it was totally normal to have said guest stay at your place for 12+ days, it happened all the time within her friend group, and she thought I was being an asshole for objecting to it. 

We've mostly worked past it and talked it through, but now ten months later she wants to have another friend from the east coast over and have her stay here and crash at our place for 12 days. She says she has earned it and compromised with me by not having anyone stay over here for that long over the last 10 months, but I still think its an egregious amount of time and you can't have a guest over for that long when you live with someone who is not friends with said guest. 

We've talked about it and realized that in large part it may be a class issue: me and my friends are from southern California and mostly grew up wealthy for the most part, which explains why we were not comfortable staying with people for very long and could make shorter across-the-country trips, while her and her friends grew up with almost no money at all and for them trips to San Diego were once in a lifetime experiences and its normal and polite to host them for two weeks or more.

0,"WIBTA for canceling RSVP to a wedding my BF isn’t invited to? | Hi all. So I just rang my friend to RSVP for her wedding for myself and my BF, but she let me know that he’s actually not invited. The lines to add names on the RSVP cards were for “families” and there isn’t room for people to bring plus ones. 

For clarity, my BF and I have been together for over 4 years and live together. He has met my friend and her fiancé on several occasions, and has even been to their apartment and various other parties and outings over the years. They aren’t close by any means (I’m not super close to her either) but I was shocked to find out my BF isn’t invited. 

I would 100% invite the SO of someone in my situation if roles were reversed. I’d invite her and her fiancé to my wedding even if they weren’t married! 

My boyfriend and I already made plans to attend (request time off work, etc) and now I have to tell him he’s actually not invited, which is just going to make him feel awkward and unwanted. 

All of my friends will be there and I was really looking forward to going, and my BF was looking forward to another opportunity to get closer to my friends (something I also want). Now it’s just awkward. Several of my friends will have their SOs there as they are engaged or are both friends with the bride/groom, whereas my BF is an “outsider”. 

My gut reaction was to angrily say “well I take back my RSVP then!” But I calmed down and told her I need to think about it and consider travel arrangements. WIBTA for canceling my RSVP and not going? More importantly, WIBTA for being angry at her? Confronting her even? I will and do see her very often. We aren’t close, but she’s part of the friend group (made up of others I am much closer to).",False,False
1,"AITA for asking my boyfriend to stop wrestling with the dog because it was weird? | We've been together for a year now and we're both 25. He has a big black lab, weighs around 80lbs that I swear he loves more than me. The dog never leaves his side, is always looking at him, and acts like an 80 pound lapdog towards him. Most nights before bed he'll get down on all fours and wrestle with her for ~10 minutes. They then go get a snack together. 




I've always thought the wrestling was weird but never said anything. Tonight he was doing it again. He doesn't use his hands or arms. Literally on all fours, they touch faces and push each other back and forth. Literally like two sumo wrestlers trying to push each other around with their body.

This is because my mother smokes a lot of cigarettes inside the house. The house is pretty tiny, so I can pretty much smell it from everywhere. The reason why I’m posting this is because my mother and I just had a fight about me wearing the face mask in the house. She says that I am overreacting, and basically being a drama queen.

0,"WIBTA if I turned a former friend into their employer for violating work rules? | So, to start off... I was friends with this person growing up. From like 2nd grade all through high school we were friends, sometimes just acquaintances and sometimes we were super close. After school, I went off to College and then eventually moved to a different state. We are still friends on FB but I don't really ever talk to her.   


I work in a level 4 state prison in Michigan. I found out that she recently started a job as a corrections officer in PA (where we grew up). Obviously, as an employee in a prison, you aren't supposed to have any type of relations or over-familiarity with any of the inmates. People get fired for that shit all the time! And frankly, I have no sympathy for them.  


I just found out that she moved a former inmate in with her and is trying to keep it super hush-hush because she WOULD get fired for that. They met while he was an inmate and she was a CO. He paroled and she moved him in with her. It's completely and totally against policy.  


Now don't get me wrong.. I am not a complete asshole. I believe people should get second chances. I am not saying that inmate doesn't deserve happiness... I don't know him. He could be a decent dude. Or he could be a piece of shit. Who knows. That's beside the point.. My own sister just got out of prison. So, I know what it is like to care for someone that has messed up. It just really grinds my gears when people do the shit that she is doing because it is super unprofessional and it makes a lot of prison staff look bad.

1,"AITA for ordering for my girlfriend at a restaurant because she took too long to decide? | My girlfriend Jackie is literally so slow to decide on anything. Restaurants are the worst. 

We went out for dinner last night and I was already dreading the ordering as soon as we walked in. 

We get the menus and Jackie doesn’t even look at the menu. She starts talking about her day and then the waitress comes back and asks us if we know what we wanna order yet. 

Jackie has still barely glanced at the menu and I can feel myself getting more and more pissed off and annoyed.

She then gets up and goes the the washroom and the waitress comes back afterwards. She says she’ll come back when Jackie is back but I stop her and say that she told me to order for her. 

I order something for Jackie and she comes back from the washroom. 

I told her that she took so long and was being embarrassing so I ordered for her.

She didn’t say much and got quiet the rest of the night. Which was fine by me.

1,"AITA for getting up in the middle of a haircut and walking out without paying because I didn't trust the hair stylist? | I'm a woman with long, thick hair, always cut with long layers. It's always been one of my best features and I get lots of compliments on it. After a brief period in high school where I foolishly spent over a hundred dollars per haircut because that was the cool thing to do, I grew up and realized that the cheap places cut my hair just as well. So, for the last twenty years or so, I have been going to Great Clips and Supercuts for cheap haircuts. I am always very happy with the results. I am not overly concerned with how each stylist I see does it a little different, because it always just seems to look fine. 

Recently I popped into Great Clips to get a haircut. The only person there was this young woman who seemed very hesitant and inexperienced. When she was washing my hair and doing the nape of my neck, I sort of lifted my head up slightly to allow her easier access, as I always do. She reprimanded me and insisted that I rest the full weight of my head on her one hand while she washed with the other hand. It did not feel normal or right to me to have her supporting my head with her hand. I thought that was odd, especially since she had been so timid before, but whatever. And she didn't towel-dry my hair very much, she left it sopping wet, which was also very strange. 

Then when we went back to the chair, she combed it out and then had me stand up while she started cutting. I have never been asked to stand up before, ever. This combined with her uncertain movements had me feeling very concerned. I tried to tell myself that she wouldn't be working there if she didn't know what she was doing, and it would be just fine. However, I couldn't take it so after maybe ten minutes I just told her ""I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable having you cut my hair. You don't seem like you know what you're doing, and I've never been asked to stand up before in my life. This just feels really weird. I'm going to go."" 

She seemed shocked and dismayed and didn't say a word. We were still the only two people in the whole place, so I just left with my hair wet. I didn't offer to pay or leave a tip, and I went directly to another place down the street and got my hair cut in the normal way, by what felt like a competent person, sitting down.

Looking back, I feel like I was maybe a little too hasty or harsh. Who knows how that impacted her self-esteem and confidence with cutting hair? On the other hand, I really didn't feel comfortable and am not going to subject myself to something I am so uncomfortable with.

He said that he didn't see any more and I went ""Look harder"" because there's always litter somewhere near well used campsites. 

He took the bag he'd dropped and was walking around and I stopped paying attention. I went to gather firewood.

I was spooked by this old guy coming out of the woods and hollering ""MISS!!"" I looked to see what was going on, and he started yelling at me and chewing me out for scaring his son, making him search through the woods for garbage meaning he was walking further from camp, for thinking I could parent a stranger's child.

I was like ""Ok now you're scaring me with that tone of voice. I don't like to be spoken to in that way. How about you go back to your camp, I go back to mine, and we have no more trouble.""

I'm now working much less and I'm less tired and I'm managing to save myself academically. The thing is my job very frequently calls me in on my days off or wants me to work days I'm not scheduled for.

1,"AITA for using potentially homophobic language? | So, a bit of backstory here. In Spanish class today, me (13M) and my mate (13/14M) were having a bit of banter. For maybe a month or so, he keeps on calling me gay, and I guess it's gets on my nerves a bit, but I called it him back.

Friend : bologneseboi, is that a fresh trim?
Me: Nah
Friend: ah, I thought you had cut you hair for your gay boyfriend
Me : meet me outside yeah? (jokingly challenging him to a fight)

After that, this girl who I'm kinda friends with took the ""fight invitation"" I gave him as some sort of romantic proposal, and said jokingly ""are you two gay with eachother?""

Responding to that, I said ""I'm not gay, but friend is!""

The teacher heard that and sent me outside the classroom. She told me to explain and I did. She then brought my friend out and started chewing us both out about using homophobic language. She said she could give us a very severe punishment for it, but said she's going to let us off with a warning this time.

0,"AITA for using my deceased friend's D&D character in a new campaign years after his death? | I used to play Dungeons and Dragons with a group of guys from high school.  There were 4 of us in total and I was the Dungeon Master.  One of the players Jeff died in a car accident a few years ago.  The other players Andrew, Sam, and I were destroyed and we gave up D&D because even thinking about it just reminded us of Jeff too much to enjoy it.  Well a few months ago and a bit of therapy later I was able to finally process my grief and move past as best I could.  I got back into the game because I feel that Jeff wouldn't want me to give up our hobby over his death.  Andrew and Sam don't feel this way and have given up the game for good.  Their choice I won't push it.

&#x200B;

Well I am the DM for this new group I put together and in this campaign the players are in the world a few centuries after the end of the previous world I ran with Andrew, Sam, and Jeff.  Their characters are now regarded as legendary warriors who saved the world several times in the past but died bravely in battle saving it one last time.  So in this world there are orders of knights and mages that are devoted to these characters and tell legends of their past adventures which is just me telling the party about all the old sessions we used to have.

&#x200B;

Andrew and Sam came over last night to hang out and they started asking me about the game.  I had avoided talking about it because Sam was the most affected by Jeff's death and I didn't want to upset him.  But now he was asking about it and seemed ok so as I told them about the world. I got to the part about their characters and Sam got upset and started yelling at me telling me I had no right to use Jeff's character like that.  That I was stomping all over the memory of our friend.  I was stunned and didn't say anything before Sam turned and left my house.  Andrew and I talked for a bit afterwards and he said he didn't think it was wrong that I used the character, but that I should have just not brought up our old characters to Sam.  I think I agree, but I'm still a little unsure which makes me feel even worse.

He is saying that I’m just getting greedy since I am now getting more press and that it is shitty that I am going back on a commitment. I told him I never committed to a piece this year but he says when you do it for 5 years straight it is a given.

As such, I take her bins out for her. Not a big issue as I have to use the same passageway to take mine out anyway and she has always been a good neighbour.

Around 2 years ago, her kids all chipped in and got her a mobillity scooter. They had spoken to her before hand but she said she did not want one as she would not use it. They went ahead and got it anyway. 2 years later and she has still yet to use it.

The issue is, it is parked in our shared passage way as there is nowhere else for it. The passege way is too narrow to allow her to keep it in the garden (would not be able to turn it to get through the back door) so there it has sat for 2 years.

Every time I need to take the bins out or use the passage way for anything really, I have to move this damn scooter, there is no light in the passage way and I have lost count of the number of times I have ran over my own foot moving the damn this out of the way.

If she used it then I would have no issue but all it has ever done since she got it is gather dust and be an inconvenience to me. I tired talking to one of her kids about it on one of their rare visits but was told that it would be 'restricting her freedom' and that she might want to use it one day, the fact that the battery has not been charged in 2 years appears to be lost on them.

0,"WIBTA for letting my 3yo nephew go into foster care? | Quick back story: The child’s mother (my wife’s sister) is addicted to meth and is a prostitute and the father has been ghost his entire life. The mother abandoned him and left him with their other sister whom she was living with at the time. The other sister eventually got fed up with the situation and basically told my wife that either we can take him or she will call CPS and let them handle it. This took place in Arizona which has a notoriously bad foster care system which usually ends up in abuse, so we couldn’t let that happen. We decided to take him for the time being.

Fast forward to now, my wife and I are at our wits end. We have 3 children of our own that we are struggling to provide for, we are currently co-living with my Mom and splitting rent/bills because we are not financially secure. My nephew was also born addicted to methadone and we’ve noticed some potential development issues coming to the surface. He can’t speak very well for his age, he doesn’t understand potty training, very destructive, whiny and just very difficult in general. I’ve seen my wife break down several times and cry because she just isn’t equipped to deal with it. It’s also taking a toll on my kids who have started to resent him, even though they may be picking that up from me and their mother. We love him, we want the best for him, but I don’t think we can provide it for him.  We don’t want to be angry with him or take out our frustrations on him because none of this is his fault, but we can’t do this anymore. We decided that we would look into other options, but there is nobody else in the family that can or will take him. The parents are MIA and the other sister said no because she needs to put her family first, which I understand. So this leaves us with the option of getting the state involved and letting him go into the system (in Texas).

As a result to this, he got a bit mad and said that I should cancel since I can have dinner with my family any other day as well.
I refused, saying that they invited me weeks ago unlike him (2 hours before he wanted to go out) and if he wanted to reschedule.

It never got to the reschedule part since he was so mad at me for being so unspontaneous, that I did not get another answer.

Before they left us with her, they told us very specifically not to play any ""x-rated"" video games or movies. Now, I'm very lenient on that stuff.

Because we were curious about how they looked and since Daisy could not stop talking about her new boobs, she took off her jacket for us to better see the results. Everyone said they looked nice. Daisy said she was shooting for a C cup look as she took off her jacket. Well they looked much bigger than that from both the eye test and the mathematical test. Since Daisy was a 32A before, got 375cc implants, and each cup size increase at a 32 band is around 130cc, she was closer to a D cup. I know this because I have been secretly thinking about getting implants myself. 


After the other two girls told Daisy that her new boobs looked great, I told Daisy that she went a bit too big with her implants if she was going for the C cup look.

1,"AITA for telling my girlfriend that I don't care about what she is talking about? | Throwaway account. Last night my girlfriend and I were hanging out on the couch. She was watching TV while I was scrolling through the news on my phone. I was in the middle of reading an article and she just started talking about stupid things (like what would happen if someone's eyeball popped out of socket) so I turned to her and said ""I'm trying to read this article and I don't really care about what you're talking about."" Maybe it wasn't the nicest way to put it but she was talking about something irrelevant that I honestly did not care about while I was in the middle of reading something. If she would have waited until I was finished reading I probably wouldn't have said that and just listened to her dumb stories.  Well she got super pissed by my comment and said ""I listen to you talk about stuff that I don't care about"" then she left my house.

0,"AITA for lying to my husband? | My husband values material things highly, and gets upset if something he owns gets damaged in any way. And I’m not talking large, expensive items. If the spine of a paperback book is opened all the way and cracked, it’s ruined. He once returned and reordered a DVD from Amazon 4 times because there were minor cracks on the case. This past Christmas, my parents gifted us a new Apple TV. The remote is glass. 

We have two boys, a very rambunctious almost 3 year old and a 1 year old. In January, the 3 year old picked the remote up off the couch and dropped it, causing it to crack. I was immediately worried because my husband had been having a terrible week. Let me preface the next few sentences by saying that my husband has never been physically abusive in any way toward me or our children. My husband’s fuse is short. He is angered easily, and he is not a calm angry person. He screams and shouts and says cruel things. Every little thing the 3 year old did that week was setting him off, and I was starting to see the 3 year old being afraid of him. So I told my husband the baby did it. The baby was in a phase of grabbing and throwing anything he could get his hands on, so it was totally plausible. I had assumed that my husband would realize that a tiny defenseless baby would not have done it out of malice, and that he would be much easier on the baby than on the 3 year old. I was wrong. I should have just told him I accidentally dropped it. He would have been furious with me, but that would have been the end of it. 

From that day on, my husband has shown an obvious and strong favoritism toward our 3 year old. He’s even said on occasion things like, “3 year old is my favorite.” And, “I don’t like baby.” It has honestly broken my heart. The baby feels everything bigger than his brother, and babies are perceptive. Even my mom has commented that she thinks the baby can sense that his father dislikes him. 

Now to the event I am asking about. Last night, I was cooking dinner, and my husband was supposed to be getting the baby down to sleep. He was getting a cup of milk ready for baby when I noticed baby was crawling around with the Apple TV remote in his hand. I mentioned it to my husband so he could go grab the remote from baby. My husband responded with something along the lines of, “What does it matter? He’s already ruined it.” I responded with, “funny story. It’s actually 3 year old who broke it.” 

My husband lost it. He called me a liar and said that he couldn’t trust me. He blamed me for his dislike of baby, saying, “you’ll have to live with the fact that YOU are the reason I don’t like baby!” He then told me that I owed him an apology for lying. I absolutely refused. I told him that I would not apologize for trying to protect my child (the 3 year old). Now he won’t even talk to me or be in the same room with me.",False,False

At one point I lost my bottoms getting out of the pool and getting into the hot tub. I was pretty drunk and didn’t notice. When I finally did notice I asked how long ago I lost them and they said maybe 20min? So I blew up at them for letting me be like that.

0,"AITA for not letting my chef brother help me in the kitchen? | My older brother is 25 and works as a chef. I imagine he’s pretty good at his job. I honestly sometimes feel like he thinks because he works as a chef he thinks he’s the only one in the family that’s a very good cook but I pride myself on my cooking, and I do have limited professional training. I would never say I’m better than him or anything like that but I definitely know what I’m doing. 

Admittedly I’ve never actually had most of his food other then the occasional salad as I’m a vegan and my brother doesn’t cook for our family often, but always cooks meat when he does. He always says he didn’t learn much about vegan cooking in culinary school but “how hard could it be.”

I cook for my family about once or twice a week when I have time. They like meat but they do enjoy certain vegan meals occasionally. My brother sometimes but not always offers his help. I always turn it down because he’s a nightmare in the kitchen to work with. He completely takes over and wants to change everything. He also always takes his time doing everything because he “has to rush at work so won’t be rushed at home” so making a salad dressing takes him like honestly 40 minutes. He’s very much a “backseat cook” and I hate hate hate it. My mom does too - she asked me to help her with Christmas dinner instead of my brother just because she doesn’t find his help helpful. 

I decided to make a special dinner for Valentine’s Day this weekend for my family and my brother offered his help. This time when I said “No thank you I can do this” he exploded on me, saying why don’t I trust him, I never let him do anything and he doesn’t feel welcome in the house to do something he’s so good at.

I was kind of shocked and don’t want to cook tomorrow anymore. WIBTA if I did that? AITA for not letting him help in the first place? I’m not a perfect cook but I honestly do know what I’m doing especially when it comes to vegan food.",False,False

She has 2 girls and 3 boys, she works full time as does he husband guy and they live in my parents house. Yes they live with my parents. My mom and dad take care of their little spawns most of the time. It really upsets me because my parents don’t have a life anymore. They have to wake up and help the kids get to school. Then they have to cook them dinner every night. It’s ridiculous. 

The worst thing is that when my parents die they are going to sell their house and divide up between all their 2 kids and all their grandkids which I think is unfair. My stupid sister has a bunch of useless kids that will end up cutting into my inheritance. I love my nieces and nephews but my sister and her husband guy aren’t smart people and their kids will likely amount to nothing. 

So when my sister announced she was pregnant it really pissed me off. I told her straight up that she was stupid and that her kid won’t do anything worthwhile in this world and it’s dumb to bring in to life. As you can imagine it pissed her and her husband guy off as well as my dad. My dad has called me an asshole for saying this and all but told me he prefers my sister and her kids to me.

0,"AITA for refusing to lend money? | Hi guys, thanks for reading
So back in December I had a couple of family members reach out and want to ""reconnect"". One of the two, my Aunt, I've not seen since 1998 when she and my mother fell out. My cousin, her daughter, I've not seen since 2007 when it transpired she was at the same school I was at and very quickly moved to London with her mother and my uncle (my mother and aunts half brother).

So all had been well, up until last week. My cousin called me in tears saying oh she can't afford essentials for her two children (I knew she had a child but didn't know about 2), diapers and milk and stuff, could I please send her about a tenner (£10) that she would give back to me in the morning.

Being the sucker I am, 8 said to her yes okay you can have that, because I won't ever see a child go without. But, half an hour later my aunt called me and asked could give them an extra twenty or thirty pounds for food. She sent me a picture of the bank account she wanted it to go to, which was for my uncle mentioned above, who is known in my local area for being a habitual drunk and drug user. 

I said no to my aunt's request guys because I'd literally spent money in my wedding dress that week, and my dog got rushed to the vets as an emergency (which cost me, my partner, and his parents almost a thousand between us) so I had no money at all. The ten pounds I sent for the diapers was stretching it a bit, literally like scraping the pot for that. I apologises and said I'm sorry, but no I've not seen you for 22 years and I simply cannot afford it. My aunt said ""I guess you don't care about us then"" and out the phone down.

Yesterday and today they've both messaged me asking if can lend them another tenner for food, cigarettes, and nappies again. I've said no again because I a) cannot afford it and b) I'm not comfortable lending money to people I barely know. My cousin has said I clearly don't have any family values, and family can't be important to me if I won't help them out.

0,"AITA for not letting a stranger sleep in my house? | TL;DR: My mother gave a friend of hers (who I’ve never met or spoken to) permission to come sleep at my house without first notifying me. 

I’m an adult (29) and I live in western PA. My mother lives in NJ, so about 5.5-6 hours from me. 

My mother texted me in the middle of the night and told me that her friend left her boyfriend, and she volunteered for me to host this person. The girl is driving from Wisconsin to Philadelphia, on the opposite side of the state from me. 

Now, I don’t know this girl. She’s supposedly around my age, my mom met her at a music festival, and she lives in Wisconsin. I have never met her, I have never spoken to her, and I’ve only ever seen her replying to my mom’s Facebook posts. 

I told my mom I’m not comfortable having a stranger in my house. She immediately got upset with me. She kept explaining that the girl is my age, and I’d really like her, and she’s really cool...on and on. I told her I’m still not comfortable with this person in my house, and she had no right to volunteer me to host a stranger. 

My mom still kept insisting that I would love her; that it’s only one night, she just needs somewhere to sleep, etc. Eventually my mother said she would drive out here (remember, a 6 hour drive) to meet her friend and stay at my house. Thankfully the girl told her she might not need to stay here, but the fact still stands that my mother wanted me to host a complete stranger that she had met at a hippie music festival and only saw twice.

It bothers me a lot, tbh I feel scared when it happens, I can't stand yelling voices at all now, like in movies or at school if someone starts to scream it freaks me out. I literally broke up with a guy because he got in the habit of yelling at video games.

I've started just leaving the house when I think it will start. Just walk for a couple miles in the woods, or walk into town and chill at the stores. Or at night walk outside and sit by the river.

It freaks my parents out; they don't like not knowing where I'm at; they know I leave when they fight and it makes them mad. I told them I won't do it when they keep their tempers in check, they'll never have to worry about it again if they can control themselves

But last week, they had a huge fight, literally started in the afternoon, I walk back to the house at night, they're still going at it. I don't go in and I go to my friends house

My dad blue up at me when I came back saying I was not allowed to leave at night unless I get permission. I need to be minding my sister.

I was talking about this lovely place and that was his response. We have been together for some time now and I have never seen him take this principled stance against alcohol. We both share an affinity for alcohol, always have. I'm confused and upset. I'm not sure if he will enjoy his time in my favorite place. I even booked a wine tasting before he told me this. Maybe it's the sudden decision to make a dramatic change, but I don't like it. I like when we drink. He flirts with me, kisses me, and laughs with me. I'm upset because this is a life decision that affects our relationship and the way we interact. The way he decided to tell me this decision to change a daily habit was rude. What if we don't get along because I've had a few drinks and he's being a stick-in-the-mud? What if I want to go and listen to music and he wants to go to bed? I love him sober, but we just laugh and laugh more when we've been drinking.

0,"WIBTA if I cancelled the friendship with my best friend because she is dating my ex. | So, I'll have to be brief here but I'll provide info in the comments if necessary. I am currently rather confused about my own feelings and I would like to have some outside perspective on whether I am TA because of what I am planning to do next.

My best friend, Kay, started dating my ex Liam behind my back. Liam and I dated for about nine months two and a half years ago and it wasn't a good relationship. He did not treat me particularly well and Kay knew about this. As my confidante and best friend, she actually knew how bad I felt in that relationship until I broke it off. I want to make it clear that today my ex is not my problem, but her actions are.

A few months ago, Kay started seeing Liam behind my back. When I realised this was happening started limiting contact with her. She noticed and started contacting a few of my friends to talk about the whole situation and - according to my friends - get validation for what her actions which apparently she even got from one of my girlfriends.  When she finally contacted me I told her that I withdrew from her as a friend because I am hurt about her actions. Now Reddit, I am fully aware that I don't own neither my ex nor will I ever tell Kay who she's got to date, it certainly isn't up to me. But I am hurt over the fact that she started dating him without ever considering how it would make me feel, throwing the last bit of loyalty and integrity towards me out of the window and that's what I told her. She apologised for not being transparent and after this she just started to pretend everything was fine between us. I kept telling her that to me it's not and that I have lost trust in her.

In my opinion she can't simply expect to date him and still maintain a friendship with me, even if that is what she so badly wants. I feel she chose him over me and I have lost my confidante over this. I don't want to stand in her way, I have always wanted nothing but happiness for her. But I definitely don't want to be a part of this. I am almost three months pregnant and I have to put my baby's and my well-being first right now and I feel like I desperately need to get away from the situation because it stresses me out so much. I think the best way to do it for me is to cut contact and cancel the friendship so I won't have to think about it ever again. I guess by doing that, I will get a lot of shit from our common social circle which stresses me out even more because of my upcoming wedding.

I don't expect her to stop dating my ex but I feel as she expects me to just pretend the whole situation didn't hurt my feelings and wants to reconcile the friendship.

Her parents pay her share of the rent since she is a college student and her tuition is funded by scholarships. However I help out too with my own money. I work part time, so not every day, but my job is now more dangerous and taxing. My gf lost her part time job (at some small food business) cuz of the outbreak, and she seems pretty upset about it, but to be honest, she has nothing to worry about financially so I'm not entire sure why. My parents don't support me financially. I've had to buy my own car, while her parents bought hers for her, so I see her as lucky. Not only that, but I'm in college too.

1,"AITA for kicking my girlfriend out of the house? | Throwaway account because, reasons.

So my girlfriend and I have been dating for about 2 years now, and we decided to move in together last month, to see whether we’re actually ready to stay together for the rest of our lives. 

Things have been going pretty great between us and we were both thinking about marriage.

But after we’ve moved in together, a couple of issues have risen. I know all couples have problems, but these don’t seem to be normal problems. 

For example, we have different schedules. I’m more of a sleep-in kind of guy, while she’s a morning person. I’m fine with that, but she has been trying to get me to wake up earlier, saying that it’s healthy and whatnot. 

Then, she’s vegetarian and I love meat. I have to have meat once a week, but she can’t stand it. She refuses to eat with me whenever I eat meat, and sometimes she refuses to sit in the same room as me later on, saying that “she can smell my chicken breath” or something.

There have been a couple more issues too around the house, and it’s become pretty clear to me that it’s not going to work out.

Now, I paid almost the entire amount for the house, while she chipped in maybe a small amount. Since I’ve spent a lot of money on the apartment, I want to stay there and continue my life. So, I told her that it wasn’t going to work out and told her to leave as soon as she could. 

Well, she claims that “the house is hers too” and that the two of us can fix our problems.

I know it’s only been a month, but I’ve found out many things about her ever since we’ve moved in together, not necessarily bad, just habits and stuff I didn’t know before. And I really don’t think we should waste any more time together. 

So far, this was all to justify why I kicked her out. Yep, I know it’s rather long but just bear with me.

So anyway, she refused to leave, even when I agreed to pay her back the amount she put in for the house. So I forced her to leave, and she had no choice but to go back to her parents’ house.

Now, her parents have called me and told me that what I’m doing is “asshole behaviour” (not the term they used, but to fit the sub). My apartment is a pretty nice place, and she’s old enough to get her own place, but I’m guessing they want the apartment since it’s in a prime location.

I can understand why they would think I’m the bad guy, since they’re her parents. But my parents have said that it wasn’t my right to kick her out too. However, I feel that the house is mine since i’m paying her back, I have paid the full amount for the house.

He then called me boring, and said he thought I was hinting that I wanted a party when I said I didn't want one, and that he was trying to be nice. Told me I ""used to be fun"" and he wanted to get me out of my shell again. He drove off to see a fuck buddy and barely helped with the cleaning.

My SO is on a strict diet to lose weight which I support he needs to lose it for health reasons we want him to be with us for a long time. But we have three growing teenagers that are all physically active between cheer, gymnastics, soccer, (our daughters), and football/basketball/baseball (our son). So we are a super busy family while my SO's job tends to be more sedentary but he has started coming to the gym with me. 

Now mealtime I will make two separate meals one for our kids which is not diet food in the sense they get regular carb food. I.e. bread, noodles, mashed potatoes, and so on. While for my So and myself I will make keto versions of said meal. I will also make things like cookies, muffins, the occasional desserts for our children. Again growing active kids who do not need to be on a diet and I'm not overloading them with these things it's normally I will make them a cpl of times a week if I have the time some weeks less. 

My SO hates that I do this and thinks I am disrespecting his diet. He thinks I am making junk food when I do this and it's taunting him because he can't have these things. However, I have pointed out that I make alternatives for him, and that even though he's on a diet our children are not nor do they need to be.

0,"AITA for not wanting a relationship with my father? | Tldr: my dad cheated on my.mom and I told him if he has a relationship with the woman he cheated on her with, I don't want a relationship with him. 

This is a really long story, and since there's a limit I'll keep it brief. My dad cheated on my mom. We found out back in the end of June. We don't know at that point if he was only emotionally cheating or if the receipt from the hotel meant he actually met up with her. My mom listened to him and agreed to give him another chance (I saw another as I said this is a long story and this was one of many chances). 

I wrote my dad a long letter at the time and basically said ""listen if you want to leave mom, do it but don't cheat. I don't care of you leave and then start a relationship, but if you leave mom for this woman you're cheating on her with, I want nothing to do with you, you won't be invited to my wedding (I'm engaged), and you'll never meet any kids I have.""

I did this because the woman he's been cheating on her with is also married and has also been harassing my mom (she called her at work from different numbers so my mom wouldn't know not to answer, taunting her and telling her she was a dumb fucking bitch). She's evil and if my dad wants to be with her I want nothing to do with either of them.

Well we found out they're still talking. My mom called me in tears and shit hit the fan cause I called the other woman's husband and told him. She now he's leaving her. My mom kicked my dad out and I used to do paperwork for my dad's business. My dad has been sucking up to me to do more work. I laid it down for him last night and reminded him that I only would if he wasn't with the other woman.

My dad told me I was fucking selfish and that he guess he wouldn't talk to me any more. 

He began calling my mom and brother and sister and trying to gaslight them and harrass them. He told my mom I'm a selfish bitch. 

Am I an asshole for not wanting a relationship with him if he's with the other woman?",False,False
0,"Aita for demanding something my great grandmother promised I'd have from a distant relative, even when it's in her will that it goes to me? | When my great grandma moved a couple years ago, a bunch of my moms cousins (my second cousins) helped her and took a bunch of stuff without asking my great grandma about it. 

My mother, grandmother,  and I couldnt help in the move because my mom was in the hospital for months straight (shes so much better now). My great grandma will be 96 this year. 

Ever since I was a little kid, my great grandma has told me that I would be getting a necklace from her, it was my grandma's first ever diamond that my great grandpa gave her. They lived a happy marriage. The thing was well taken care of for it being around 70 years old. She put it in a box and planned on giving it to me either when I turned 21, or for my wedding, or when she passed it would go to me. She even addressed the box to me to make sure I'd get it. 

Well when she moved and my second cousins helped, this necklace dissapeared. The oldest of the cousins took it. At first, she had thought she put it in her closet with her other jewelry. Now after 2-3 years, it's still gone. 

A couple weeks ago, the oldest second cousin posts a photo of the box with the necklace in it (with what my grandma wrote on it too) and says she was cleaning and found a family heirloom (my great grandma has really fancy handwriting and it's sometimes hard to read but u can easily see my name is spelled on it.)

I wanna ask for this necklace, as my great grandma had intended it to go down to the 1st born female in my family. My grandma would have gotten it but she has passed and wouldnt want it. My mom would prefer I'd have it. Great grandma had a son and a daughter (my grandmother) and planned to give it to my grandmother.

I wanna ask for this necklace when it's supposed to go to me, as I want to wear it for special events like my great grandmother wants me to, especially since I'm getting married soon.

0,"AITA For telling my boyfriend my mom said he's autistic? | Backstory- my[28F] bf [29M] and I went to a family cookout a few months ago. He and my mom were talking. She commented that her Mac n cheese she made was dry. He responded ""It is a little dry, but I'm sure it'll be better next time!"" Also, he and her are friends in FB and he posts a lot of stuff about murders and serial killers. He also collects knives. He's never seemed the least bit violent towards me or anyone else since I've known him (7 months).

A few weeks ago my mother told me she thinks my bf is autistic bc of the reasons I listed above. I found it to be ridiculous that she made the assumption based off of meeting him two times and the things he posts on the internet. Please note that I don't have anything against people with autism, I don't find that in itself to be offensive, and if my bf were autistic it wouldn't be a problem for me in the slightest. 

Anyway, one day it just slipped out to my boyfriend. I was on a rant about my mother and it just came out-  ""And catch this shit- my mom thinks you're autistic bc you share weird stuff on your FB and said her Mac cheese was dry."" 

It wasn't meant to be a big deal, he didn't even care. He said he would joke about it with her the next time he sees her. He did tell his parents, however, since they are very close. 

My mom messaged me yesterday- I guess my sister told her I told my bf. She exploded, saying she can't trust me, saying I've ruined all chance of her and my bf having a relationship, that she can never meet his parentsz that I should tell his parents all of my dirty laundry to make it fair(????)and that she'll only speak to me now if he's not around, and she plans to never speak to him again bc I made things awkward, among other horrible things a parent should never say to a child. She was so upset she was screaming, calling me an effing b----, saying I've ruined everything etc. I was just so taken aback and hurt by what she said. 

So please tell me- am I the asshole? Im really not sure if I effed this one up.. I never intended to cause so much drama with one sentence. I'm just so confused.",False,False

Anyways after 3 years my aunt went back to Nicaragua because she did not like it here, I can count in one hand the amount of times I’ve talked to her since she left. So the other day, i receive a text message on WhatsApp from her asking me how I was, etc etc.... I respond to her and tell her that I am currently at work that I won’t be able to text her back. She responds saying it’s fine, that we could talk later. An hour or so later she sends me a text saying that she’s been sick lately and that she doesn’t have the money to buy medicine due to the situation being tough back in Nicaragua, which I understand. I see the text on the my lock screen but I don’t read it. My boss who also uses WhatsApp sent me a couple of messages work related and I opened the app. I’m still at work so I haven’t responded to my aunt. 30 minutes later I get a text from her saying “Wow thank you so much nephew for having the courtesy to respond to me when I’m in need”. Now this really bothered me when it finally wrapped around my head. I didn’t mean not to reply to her, but I’m obviously at work so I couldn’t get to her at the moment. I get home and explain the situation to my mom, she tells me that she was going to talk to her, she also confirms with me that she has been sick and I should probably send her the money. I was honestly very bothered by the fact that she sent that last message the way she did and I explained to my mom that I didn’t want to send her any money because of that and the fact that I hadn’t talked to her in so many years and the first time she reaches out to me is to ask me for something. I already send a pretty decent amount of money to my grandma bi-weekly for her to be good over there. I also buy shoes, send clothes, and money to my dad who also lives over there. So me sending money when I can is not a problem but I don’t like the way this situation unfolded. The only reason I’m posting this here is because I got an argument with my mom because she believed I should send my aunt money because she brought me to this country and she needs help. I refused and went back and forth with her and it ended with my mom saying that I’ve change,I’m not recognizable, and it’s not how she has raised me.

1,"AITA for not planning a bachelorette party as maid of honor? | Ughhhh.

I read this sub all the time but never thought I’d be posting here. I’m kind of worried I messed up but I want to make sure this isn’t just my anxiety talking. 

My childhood friend, let’s call her Becca, got engaged to her fiancé last summer and asked me to be her maid of honor. I was pretty surprised, since we’ve drifted apart quite a bit since we were kids, but I was happy for her and I accepted. I wouldn’t consider us best friends or anything, but we talk pretty frequently and see each other at least once or twice a month.

Becca’s wedding is this Saturday, and she texted me last week and asked what my plans were for the weekend before the wedding. I thought maybe she needed help with some last-minute wedding stuff, so I said I could stop by her apartment and help her.  

I could tell something was bothering her and she eventually started tearing up and said she was really disappointed that nobody had planned a bachelorette party for her. She said she thought we were really close and didn’t understand why it hadn’t occurred to me to ask if she wanted one.  

Maybe I’m just dumb but this is my first time being part of a wedding party and I honestly didn’t know I was supposed to plan a bachelorette, I thought the bride normally did it. I’ve only been to one bachelorette before, for my cousin, and she planned the whole thing herself. Also, none of the girls in the wedding party really know each other that well (the bridesmaids are her college bestie, her fiancé’s sister and a friend she met through work), so I’m not sure how it would even have happened tbh. 

At this point, it’s way too late to plan anything before the wedding. This is a really busy week at work, and I can’t ask for time off with this little notice. Friday night is the rehearsal dinner and obviously Saturday is the wedding day. I told Becca maybe we could go get drinks after she got back from her honeymoon to celebrate instead and she was like “I guess” and said it wouldn’t be the same. 

I do feel bad, but I also think she should have communicated her expectations to me. So give it to me straight, AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for asking future sister in law to step down as bridesmaid? | *LONG POST*

My (26F) fiance's (25M) sister (17) agreed to be a bridesmaid almost 2 years ago when we got engaged. She came shopping for my dress with the other bridesmaids (my sister and 2 best friends) and family and all seemed fine. 

The other bridesmaids are trying to organise a weekend away in a cabin somewhere a couple of hours drive away to hang out together and chill - FSIL dragged her feet but finally agreed the first weekend in May. I'm going to have a night out in my city nearer the wedding with a much bigger group of friends and family. 

The other bridesmaids all work shifts and have to do some weekends so said they can work around her and get swaps/holidays. FSIL is in college 3 days a week and doesn't have a job but does competitive swimming. She now says she can't go the weekend she agreed because she has an international comp 2 weeks after we were meant to go and doesn't feel she can take a full Friday to Sunday off. 
I suggested we make it just a Saturday to Sunday and she said ""maybe bit it's not fair on everyone else"". The others have all tried to include her and I messaged her to ask her to try and make it because I really wanted her there. 

My fiance spoke to her last night and said how much it meant to me for her to be there and she said that she ""doesn't really click with anyone"" except me and my sister, everyone is 4 or 5 years older than her, has ""a lot on right now"" and she's the problem so we should go without her (a line she's repeated several times to us all). 

I don't feel this is too much to ask and I know her dad (also fiance's dad) will have agreed to cover anything she needs for the wedding as he and her mum (fiance's stepmum) are comfortable so her lack of a job isn't an issue either. What makes it a little more awkward is that her dad is supposed to be conducting our ceremony so it could make him annoyed with my fiance and I if we ask his daughter to step down. 

I don't like the idea of giving her an ultimatum but I feel she doesn't have any interest in the wedding and hasn't really asked about it since we got engaged. Also she's taking 2 weeks away for her 18th in April so is missing training for the fortnight but can't miss essentially one Saturday practice for this. She also hasn't mentioned anything about the ""night out"" hen party either which I feel she will also miss because of the same reasons she gave for the weekend away.

0,"AITA for feeling annoyed that my boyfriend's mom kept some of my clothes meant for donation? | I believe I'm technically not in the wrong because this is all in my thoughts and I haven't vocalized this or made it evident, but I wanted to see if I'm justified in the way I feel.

I kept a running donation box for 6 months in my apartment, and would periodically throw clothes in there when I felt ready to donate them. There were a lot of clothes in there near the end and they ranged from more inexpensive stuff like F21 and H&M to slightly more expensive clothes from Ann Taylor and J.Crew. Nothing extremely expensive/designer, but there were clothes in there that were barely worn or still with tags on them. I thought it'd be nice to donate everything; not to mention, I didn't have time to even think about selling them.

My BF and I have been together for 5 years, and his little sister (20yo) is a similar size as me, maybe one size larger (XS vs. S). It did cross my mind that I could've given some clothes to her, but 1) I've already done that in the past with two nice coats, 2) she's never displayed a ton of appreciation for gifts, 3) their family is not hurting for $, with an income of \~$1m.

His mom came over, noticed the box, and asked what it was about, so I explained that I'd been wanting to donate the clothes. She said, ""Oh! I could just drop it off at the donation center in \[underserved town next to hers\], if you'd like?"" I thought that was really generous of her, and took her up on the offer after double checking it was not a chore for her.

Anyway, I saw his parents again weeks later and mom said, ""You had some pretty decent stuff in there! I took and saved some for \[sister\].""

I can't help but feel totally annoyed with this. On one hand - yes, mom was kind enough to drop it off for me. On the other hand - the clothes were meant to be donated.

0,"AITA for snowblowing at 4 AM? | Last year I had an argument with a neighbor during the winter, right in my driveway.  Had a particularly heavy snowfall and had to leave my house by 6 AM to get to work.  So I was out at 4 AM, just started the snowblower to get my driveway cleared.  He surprised me by actually leaving his house in middle of a blowing blizzard to come and argue with me.

I explained to the guy that I am out here running a snowblower because I have to get to work.  I assured him that I'm out here for a good reason, not because its my favorite god damned time to move snow!  The only thing worse than having to listen to a snowblower at 4 AM from *inside the house* is being the guy who is running one *outdoors* at this ungodly hour.         
 I told him he should be thankful (he is retired and has no need; presumably) that he doesnt need to run a snowblower and can stay indoors.  I also pointed out to him that the city runs plows, salt trucks and other heavy equipment which is louder than my snowblower.  They have a duty to keep the roads clear.  Snowfall is one of those things that needs to be dealt with.

He started to get nitpicky and asked if I could do just enough so my car could leave.  I explained that there are other users of this driveway than just myself so the entire thing had to be done.  Plus I'm not going to fire up the blower for just 5 minutes and then have to fire it up again at night when I return from work to do the rest of it.  Absurd.  When I return, the snow is heavier and probably iced up making for a harder job.  He just wanted to argue so I started the machine, turned my back to him and proceeded to do the rest of my driveway.  I had places to be and had no time to argue.

Wanted to add that we live in a northern US state that sees much winter snowfall.  It's no surprise that when snow falls, we need to deal with it, including removing it.  All my years snowblowing at early hours and this is the first time someone has actually had the energy and drive to come outside and argue!  I have heard other's snowblowing noise at odd hours and never thought to confront them with hostility about it.  Even if I did wake up from the noise.  I always figured noise is just a part of urban/suburban life.  Until I live in the country side, I wouldnt complain.

Lastly, its not illegal to remove snow at any hour.  We have a noise ordinance that exempts snow removal equipment noise following a storm.  I'm not worried about the legality of this, more about the manners and etiquette regarding neighborly relations.  Does this guy have a leg to stand on?  What would you do here?",False,False
1,"Update: WIBTA if I told my daughter to find a different hobby | Belated update to a post that was largely considered trolling, but wasn't. 

I won't lie when I say that I immediately ignored the majority of you telling me I was the asshole. Or maybe ignore is the wrong word. I think I expected that from the get go, so being told I ""peaked in high school"" and ""should get fucked along with all the plastic cheerleader wannabe SAHMs"" rolled off my back. But, there were a few of you that did make me think long and hard about my relationship with my daughter and what sort of model (haha) I was setting for her. There was one comment in particular that's been sort of lost to the flood (if you can find it, I'd surely appreciate that) that mentioned my writing and how well it read, almost like a book.

Maybe it's self absorbed, but that's really what made me stop for a moment. I've had to sacrifice a lot to get my family where they are today. I won't get into details because I'm sure it would be boring and pretentious and might make you all feel that I'm just trying to garner sympathy after being such a bitch, but it did involve giving up my dreams in order to make sure there was food on the table. I gave myself some time and space to think and realized the problem stemmed from me, not her. (Surprise) I was bitter that everyone else seemed free to chase their passions when I had to work at things I hated for the things we needed. It seemed childish to me to be so selfish as to enjoy your free time when you could be making an effort for your family instead. That's neither here nor there but it definitely wasn't my daughter's fault that I was so resentful. 

I like to think she was relatively unaware of my concerns with her hobbies (I never voiced my opinion one way or another and always drove her to Michaels) but I can say with certainty that our relationship has only improved in the last few months. I helped her build a miniature restaurant last Saturday and I've got a fun little carnival on my nightstand as I type this. I can't regain the time I've lost, but I can make sure she doesn't have to live the life I'm currently living.

Now I realize chocolate is unhealthy for dogs, so I would never feed him a whole chocolate bar or anything crazy like that, at most I just give him a kit kat snack-sized piece or something like that for scale, and only a few times a week at most. I've been doing this for a few months now and up until a couple days ago my gf was unaware of this (I honestly did not tell her because I didn't see it as a big deal, not because I was hiding it). 

She found out and went ballistic on me and told me I was being cruel to him. I argued that small amounts isn't going to do any harm to him. I told her that she feeds him excessively and as a result he's overweight, so she's being hypocritical. 

We got into a huge argument and my gf threatened to take him to her parents so I can't feed him chocolate. However I was the one who paid for the dog, so I told her he's my dog first and foremost and what I feed him is none of her business.

1,"AITA for planning a two week long trip out of state to visit family without discussing it with my wife? | Hey guys, so I'm going to give both sides because we both usually use this and want to get the full story told so we know who is really in the wrong here.


I just recently found out my grandpa is dying. I haven't seen him in 17 years. I've always wanted to visit, but never could, and now that he's dying I want to see him one last time. When I heard the news, I didn't even think about it, I just bought the plane ticket. He's in Maine, we're in Texas. I'm going for two weeks.


When I told my wife, she was pissed. She said she couldn't believe I didn't at least discuss it with her first, rather than just telling her I'm leaving. But that was because it was a split second decision, plus we have a 5 month old that we can't exactly bring with us and she just started a new job, so she can't really just leave for two weeks.


She suggested we wait and go together later on, and just go for a couple days, but we still would have to find something to do with the baby, and she'd have to find time off work, and we'd have to afford a 2nd plane ticket, and I really wanted to stay at least 2 weeks to spend time with family and have time to myself to recover from the plane trip before I meet up with them. Shes now demanding I cancel it until its discussed further, I think that's totally unreasonable considering I already bought it and I don't exactly know how long he's going to live. It might be too late if we wait. AITA?

Wife's side


So, my husband has been talking about visiting his family for the past 6 years. I've always encouraged him to, way before the baby. He always used the fact that he hates planes as an excuse, as well as not being sure how to face his family after going so long without seeing them. He does however facetime them fairly often and seems to do fine with that. His parents also offered to let us ride with them when they visit, which he also turned down.


Now, years later, when we have a baby and I just started working again after a complicated pregnancy and even more complicated emergency c section recovery, he drops on me, hey, I'm leaving the 25th to go see my family for 2 weeks in Maine. I'm sorry but WTF?? Where was the discussion for this huge decision? I have to find last minute childcare (my only close relatives are my elderly grandparents so they can't help), rides to work (legally blind, can't drive even with glasses), and balance work and baby with no support for two weeks. I did freak out when he told me, and told him he needs to cancel the trip right away until we properly discuss it and figure something out, but that something will most definitely not include leaving for two damn weeks, but rather maybe 3 days with us BOTH.

My son (7)overheard and asked if he could come, so did my daughter (8). My son asked if he could get some potato chips. My boyfriend just shrugged and said “sure, why not.”. My daughter asked if she could get a snack too and he agreed.

Now, after the first errand, they started to get bored and when i got them to the store, they were going crazy. They were putting stuff like cookies and snack cakes in my buggy. I tried telling them no, but they didn’t listen. We got to the potato chip aisle and my son just started picking up and picking up all kinds of different bags.

0,"AITA for having my deaf-mute neighbours' dogs removed from the neighbourhood? | AITA for having my deaf-mute neighbours' dogs removed from the neighbourhood?

My parents and I live next to a deaf-mute couple who own two dogs. In the past we had no issue with them, but our neighbours have allowed their dogs to bark all day for HOURS ON END. Naturally due to the neighbours' deafness, they cannot hear their dogs barking and it simply continues....

When the issue first occured, we left a note in their mailbox politely explaining that my brother and father work jobs that require them to wake up early in the mornings and the incessant barking was becoming an issue. A week went by and we received no response, yet the barking continued. Eventually my mother contacted the father of the deaf-mute husband and explained the situation, his only response was to laugh and tell my mother ""your husband and son should just use ear plugs or sleep in different rooms"".

My mother decided to contact the local council about the issue. After about two months, the council issued a formal warning. The barking continued....

My mother contacted the father again abd explained our situation, the father explained in an irritated manner that ""the dogs are there to help his deaf-mute son and wife with their daily activities due to their conditiod, and that we should just put up with it"". We were confued, surely there is no need for their dogs to incessantly bark like that though? 

Eventually we sought mediation from the council, and the council ruled that one of the dogs be separated and live at the father's property. The neighbours were not happy but complied for a while.

This brings me to the present. I am starting to get fed up with the fact that the neighbours seem to pay no regard to us or the official warnings issued by the council.

So I took matters into my own hands.

Unhappy with the fact that the father neighbours are so inconsiderate and seemingly thinking that this issue is a big joke by laughing at us whenever they see us, I contacted the father myself this time. I explained to him that the barking has continued for months now despite our complaints, and how his son laughs whenever he sees us, I gave him an ultimatum.

They either adhere to the official orders ruled by the council, or I take the matter to the court. This did not sit well with the father, as he decided to abuse me over the phone calling, my family horrible people, stripping his disabled son and wife of their right to have dogs.

I filed for the court proceeding and the magistrate ruled both dogs off the premises as it was quite clear to her that the dogs were merely pets, rather than aids, as there was no paper-work to prove such a thing.

While we are happy with this outcome, we still cop abuse from the husband and dead-mute neighbours occassionally....

0,"WIBTA if I went a two weeks business trip, leaving my wife completely alone with a newborn? | TL:DR at the bottom.

Ok, so, my (30) wife (28) is 7 months pregnant, we’re due in November. It’s going to be our first child and we’re both stupidly excited and terrified. I’m working and she’s a stay-at-home wife, soon to be stay-at-home mom.

Unfortunately, however, I got fired. More specifically, my company terminates my contract with the end of October, offering a very generous severance pay.

So we made a decision – use the severance pay to allow me to stay unemployed for two months, so that I can stay with my wife for the final weeks of the pregnancy, the birth, and then the first couple of weeks of being with our newborn. I am now searching for a new job with the idea of starting in January 2020. She’s totally on board with this and we’re both very happy for this “paternity leave” of mine.

So I got a job offer, and for all intents and purposes, it’s a dream job that I had been coveting for the past several years. Great company, great position, amazing money (more than TWICE my current salary). Chances of me finding anything comparable right now are next to none. Normally it would be a no-brainer for me to accept it.

The catch: as part of the induction/training for this role, I would have to go on a 2-week business trip in the second half of January, abroad, potentially even to the US (I’m in Europe), leaving my wife completely alone with a 2-month-old baby, and 2 dogs, for 2 weeks. I’m VERY uncomfortable with this idea and it makes me feel at best like an asshole and at worst as a monster.

Important details: she would be pretty much completely alone and nobody would be able to help. Our families are not in the picture, they live too far away to be able to assist. We don’t have any friends locally (at least not close enough to help with baby and house management), nor any sufficiently friendly neighbours. We have 2 dogs, and no garden, so the dogs need to be walked, at least twice a day. She would have to manage the baby, the apartment, the dogs, any shopping and what-not, cooking, and basically anything and everything else, all by herself.

She’s saying she “will manage”, she’s happy that I got the job offer and is telling me I should take it. I’m not sure she really comprehends the challenge of having a newborn in the house all by herself.

0,"AITA - applied for & got a job after being asked not to | My 3-streets-over neighbor Leah and I are in each other’s orbits bc we have to be. Both have kids the same age, on the PTA together, mutual friends, kids in the same sports league and school. Never dislike but never warm bonding either. 

Here’s the timeline of what all happened:

April: I was working for a smaller  company and it would have been great except the owner was a total psycho and kept firing people. I started applying for jobs; and emailed Leah with my resume, asked if she’d submit it for an open role at her company. I indicated it was no problem And no explanation needed if she said no. This company is kind of sought-after as an employer and has a decent referral bonus. 

Leah emailed me back. Sorry, she wasn’t comfortable working with somebody she knew. This co has 6000 employees in our city and she and I have very different job functions but whatever. 

ETA: I got fired a couple days later; the owner claimed my resume “was seen” on a job board. 

I shook Leah’s email off and applied anyway. In the last year we’d been granted custody of my late cousin’s 2 kids on top of our 3 biological ones. Not cheap. 

I heard a couple snotty comments from Leah about, “god it must be so embarrassing to be fired” and “job searching is so hard” during the time I was out of work. 

I interviewed, got the job and started in May. Turns out my former employer has himself a bad rep. Yay! It’s gone great for me. 

I didn’t reach out to Leah not wanting her to F anything up. I also kept quiet about getting a new job, where I was working, etc around everybody we mutually know. 

Today: I finally saw her in the company cafeteria. She acted all defensive and creeped out, asked me what was I doing there. I explained I’d started recently and she continued to look at me like one would look at a crazy person screaming on the subway about the apocalypse. 

She asked to see my badge, which I showed her, and then said, “great catching up, see you around!” and went back to my desk to eat. 

I got a couple IMs from her that she felt like I was devious to apply for the job knowing she wasn’t comfortable working with me. I pushed back that our jobs haven’t intersected in 6 months, and that in a company this large there must be other people she knows outside of work - there are at least 3 other parents from our kids school I’ve run into. She pushed back that I should’ve respected her wishes and that she felt I’d deceived people. I responded that I was done with the conversation.

0,"AITA Telling my roommate she can't leave her stuff in the house? | So there are only 3 people in my household. There's me, my bf, and my roommate. Well, at first it was great having my roommate live with us. The rent is split 3 ways evenly. Food is shared. And both our dogs are taken care for. 

Problem is, my rm just somehow loves to provoke drama. It started off with her bf staying over rent free and not doing anything. Raising our utilities about 50 bucks higher. So I confronted her on that. Then recently she had the nerve to go on twitter and post about how dare I whine/complain about caring for her dog. All the while SHE ASKED ME TO WALK HIM THROUGH MESSAGE. My friends recently showed me another thing she posted basically saying she wants out. 

So we talked about it. Shes moving out. Well here's where I was confused. It's already november and all of a sudden she wants out by the end of this month. She also just told us this.. then she tells us she hasn't packed yet but plans to soon. She then says she plans to leave her furniture and such until its convenient for her. 

I tell her no, it's not fair that she all of a sudden wants to move and wants us to keep her stuff safe without paying rent.

1,"AITA for ""ruining"" my girlfriend's birthday? | Long post but please hear me out :(

I have a chronic disease that often causes lots of pain. Yesterday was my girlfriend's birthday, and the past couple of days have been pretty bad to put it lightly. The day prior I took her out to eat, took her shopping, and then took her to her favorite little park that has a waterfall. I was trying my best to keep it together, but pain like this is going to show no matter what. I apparently frustrated her because I complained quite a few times about how much pain I was in and with the pace I had to walk (part of the pain right now is in my leg and I have to limp around so I walk pretty slowly). That night I went to bed pretty early as my disease causes me fatigue (and we did quite a bit that day) and that is the only way for me to escape the pain besides drowning myself in painkillers and the like.

The morning of her birthday I slept in again for the same reason, and I know this upset her very much. I didn't wake up until around noon, which meant half of her birthday was already over :(. When I woke up I gave her her gifts (everything she told me she wanted: a new ring, shoes, some makeup and a bouquet of flowers). After that, it took me quite a while to get ready and we didn't end up leaving the apartment until around 2:30 to head to her family's house (when she originally told me she wanted to leave around noon). At her family's house I didn't really talk much and didn't participate in all of the things they were doing because of my pain. 

After all of this we had to head to her grandmother's house as she was leaving for a trip and she wanted us to take care of her dog and watch over the house. While packing my stuff I admittedly snapped on her a little bit as I felt like I was reaching my limit and was having to carry around a couple of pretty heavy things which increased my pain even more. 

This morning she told me that I ""ruined"" her 21st birthday and she feels like I don't care about her. She texted me ""one day...my fucking birthday...that's all I wanted.""

Now in addition to the pain I feel fucking awful. It hurt so bad to hear that I ""ruined"" her 21st birthday and I kind of fell silent after that because I didn't know what to say which just made her more upset with me.

1,"AITA for refusing to take my disabled sister to the doctor? | My sister Ellie (22) was diagnosed with MS three years ago. Shortly after diagnosis she was wheel chair bound and had little control of her body. In the last 2 years, she has made great strides. She is able to walk with a walking stick and has gotten her license back. She regularly has to see specialist doctors for meds and scans. She is on SSI. 

The problem: My husband and I work opposite shifts, I work two jobs. We have two children, 6F&2M. After a hurricane, our area lost most of its childcare. For six months my kids stayed with my parents/siblings in OH, we are in FL, so that we could do repairs and try to find care. After some issues with family, they came home but we did not have child care. 

We decided to move Ellie down to FL to provide childcare until we can find a reliable sitter or center. This was two months ago. We agreed to pay her $150 a week, her housing (her own room, my kids now share), food, toiletries are all included. When we agreed to move her here, it was discussed that she will need to get to her specialist appts. We agreed that we would make sure she got there. This was made thinking she would be seeing a doctor 2 hrs away (in a city I travel to for appts). She got doctors in a city 6 hrs away. Ellie is using the money she receives from us to pay rent on a home in OH that my parents ""own"" (they live in AL now). Without us paying her, they would not be able to maintain the home in OH, where my Gma, bro/sis lives. A week before she moved, I found a sitter who would do it for $30 a day, up to 12 hrs. We still had Ellie come.

3 weeks ago my sister took a bus to the doctors. She missed one and had to buy a 2nd ticket and she wanted us to pay for the tickets. I said that is not the agreement. When mentioning her next appt, I told her it 100% could not be on the 7th, my DH and I must go to an appt ourselves. 

Yesterday she told me the appt is for the 7th. I flipped. I told her that was unacceptable. She pulled the pity card and tried to act remorseful. I told her we absolutely can’t take her. She wanted us to take her today and pick her up at the end of next week. I told her she can’t tell us the day before an appointment and expect us to cater to her schedule. This is the last straw after many. When she left last, she was gone 4 days and only watched my son for 1 day. I am paying the sitter 3 days, afterschool for my 6 yo (because Ellie can’t go pick her up down the street) and her. She was upset that she only got $100. She doesn't clean the house as agreed, she is rude to my children (she has been a bitch her whole life and being sick doesn't excuse her from it), she doesn't watch them like she is supposed to. I feel I am bending over backwards to help her out and she couldn't be less grateful. I am sick of it and I want to fire her and be done with it.

0,"AITA for telling my employer I can't work the hours I was scheduled? | For reference, I'm a college student that moved back home because of online classes. To make a little extra money, I picked up a job at Publix (grocery store) in GA about a month ago.

Because I'm a full time student, I told them when I was hired that the max amount of hours I could work in a week was 28. Due to staffing difficulties, the dept. has been pressed for workers. I was originally scheduled 24 hours last week and ended up working 37 to help out and get everything done. This took a huge toll on me and my schoolwork. I just got the schedule for the next two weeks (4/12-4/26) on Thursday -- I am working nearly 40 hours both weeks. I absolutely cannot work these hours because I have finals. When I spoke with the store manager about it, she told me there's nothing that could be done as the schedules were already made and I should've given specific dates I could not work. I did that as well and they still scheduled me a shift this week when I have class. I feel that even though my schedule is flexible, the max amount of hours I can work weekly should have been adhered to.

On the other hand, if I don't work these hours then everyone else in the department ends up having to work insane shifts (12+ hours) just to get everything done. I'm not trying to shift the burden on anyone else, but school ultimately is most important to me right now. This is my first job, so I'm trying to remain as professional as possible (even though I probably won't include this on any resume in the future).

I'm considering speaking with management and letting them know that I will not be able to work that many hours because I am a full time student with a part time job. If they can't accommodate my hours that I asked for, then I will have to leave and focus on school full time before next week.

A few minutes later the waiter comes over to the table with the drink and my buddy spots that it's a regular Stella Artois, and not the cider.  So he says ""Hey, just double-checking, is that the cider?"" And the waiter says ""Oh, no.  My bad!  Be right back with that!"". And starts to walk away with it.

That's when I chime in not wanting good beer to go to waste and say ""If you're going to just dump that, I can drink it."". So he says sure and leaves it at the table.

A little later we order the check, and both the cider and the regular Stella are on the check at full price.  So I grab his attention and ask if he meant to put both on the check, and he says ""yea, that's what you wanted, right?"".  And then I explained I would have just stayed with what I was drinking had I known it was going on the check.

0,"AITA for taking back my money from a charity organisation that supports deaf people? | A person who was deaf was collecting donations came up to me while I was eating dinner at a restaurant asking for donations. This charity organisation had a weird system where if you donated $10, you would be able to write your name on a card, which I assume will recognise you for your act. Although I am still studying at a considerably young age, I tried to give her the most I could possibly spare.  I decided to hand her a $5 bill, and as I handed her the bill, she had this look of unsatisfaction on her face. 

Due to me not reading the instructions Clearly, as I proceeded to write my name, the lady quickly pulls back and shows me the amount that must be donated so I could write my name. As I sat there just realising to the mistake I made, the women just walks off. No sign of appreciation or sign of gratitude she just walks away with my money. Now, I understand that $5 is not a lot of money but I am a student and to me and where I come from, $5 does many things.

At that moment, I had the suspicion that this might be a scam.  It was a conflicting thought, I believed that whatever you give should not have a limit and should be always appreciated as long as you don't give something insulting like a 25 cent coin. But on the other hand, I believed that some people who donates hundreds or thousands of dollars to charity SHOULD be recognised and appreciated. 

But whatever the thought was, I decided to take my money back. I kindly tried to call her back, and as she reached my table, I had to kindly ask for my money back. At first she didn't get what I was talking about, but when I kindly pointed to my $5, she knew what i was talking about. She pulled this really unhappy face and sort of had refusingly returned back my $5. It took her a long 2 minutes to give me back my money so much so that I had to lightly tug it away from her as I thought she didn't get the message. As I put the money back into my wallet, she had this really unpleasant look on her face as she walked away. I felt bad, but at the same time, I can't help but feel like I just got out of a scam.

0,"WIBTA if I didn’t go to my SO’s brother’s wedding? | My boyfriend (Alex) and I have been dating for three years. His brother (Eric) and his brother’s fiancé (Jess) have been dating for the same amount of time. 

Jess and I have never gotten along. I’m not lying when I say I have NO idea why. We lived in the same city as them for a couple years, 5 minutes away from each other, and we hung out two, maybe three times over those years. Jess is very standoffish toward me. If the boys left to go get drinks, I would try to make conversation, she would act like I wasn’t talking to her. I would invite her to things, she wouldn’t come, etc. Later it gets back to us that she had been telling his parents/family that I’m not nice to her and I’m the problem. This was clearly annoying and as frustrating as it was, I didn’t want to continue to get his parents involved and I didn’t want to talk bad about her to them, so Alex and I reached out directly to Eric and Jess to ask to go to dinner to clear everything up. They responded saying it wasn’t necessary. So, we really just kind of stopped trying. We would see them over holidays at his parents (in another state) and it was awkward, to say the least. It’s a constant elephant in the room. They eventually move back to their home state where both of their families live. 

Fast forward a few years and they’re getting married. I’ve tried to be as involved by attending the bachelorette party and bridal shower. In Jess’s defense, she was nice to me at these events and I thought we were putting everything behind us. Now it comes down to the actual accommodations for the wedding. 

The wedding reception is at a cabin in the mountains. They have been talking about how they don’t know who all would get to stay in the cabins because there’s limited space. Wedding invites come out and their guests’ hotel is an hour away because all hotels in the town are booked for graduation weekend. I ask Alex to reach out to Eric to ask if I needed to find other accommodations. Alex is the best man so I assumed he would be staying but didn’t know about me. Eric assures Alex  I’m absolutely staying.

A week ago, Eric calls and says plans have changed, and I was no longer going to stay at the cabins the night before the wedding. It would be wedding party only, so Alex will be staying there but not me. Alex tells me this and I’m annoyed as there are no hotels or air bnbs available. Even the hotel they asked their guests to stay at is totally booked. Alex suggests I stay with his family (an hour away) but I’m not super close with them, I don’t want to drink at the party and have to drive an hour back. Alex gets annoyed (this whole wedding has put him in a mood) and says he can’t control Jess and her pettiness, and I have two options. Stay with his family or don’t come at all.

0,"AITA for expecting my husband to help in the middle of the night without arguing. | My husband and I have a 2.5 month old, and as you can imagine our baby comes with his share of needs to be met including in the middle of the night.

Early on my husband and I developed a system where I would nurse him from one breast, then my husband would change his diaper then I'd nurse him from the other breast before putting him back to sleep. This helped because it meant that after falling asleep on the first breast my husband could wake him up a little to get him to eat more from the second which meant more sleeping between feedings. Also if I changed his diaper if have to set him down and wash my hands before starting the other side and he'd already be asleep which didn't work as well.

My husband would fuss and complain every time I woke him up to do a diaper change, but after the first few weeks (when we didn't really sleep at all anyway) it was really only 2-3 times a night so it wasn't terrible.

Then 2 weeks ago, it was discovered that I had a raging infection in my left breast. I didn't get a fever or anything like most do, so by the time it was discovered it was huge and required surgery to drain and clean out.

Unfortunately now I'm nursing from only one side and desperately trying to build my supply up on that side to try and support a rapidly growing baby. This means he's hungry every 1.5-2 hours day and night.

Now every time I wake my husband up to do a diaper change he complains and argues and asks for more time then after getting a bit more time he complains and argues again how he shouldn't have to change the diapers. In the mean time I have to pump and store any milk I might pump then clean them pump parts before I can go back to sleep.

All this arguing plus the extra steps of getting up 5-6 times a night means that while my husband snores away between feedings I lay awake in bed being pissed off at him.

We talk about it every morning, and he apologizes and says he'll try to be better but he's just so tired, and he can't help what he says and does when he's first woken up and how he'll try to be better but probably just can't change.

We tried to set up a deal last night where I would give him a 3 minute warning (can you tell I work with kids?) And after his 3 minutes he would get up and take care of the baby without asking for more time or arguing. Right now it's 3am all 3 times he's asked for more time, then argued about how I should just change the diaper myself then finally told me ""I'm working on getting up"" while falling back asleep 2 more times.

But wait! There was a straggler pack waayy in the back on the middle shelf (too high for most people to reach, including myself). Without hesitation, I kinda squeezed in underneath and pushed it across the metal bars to the front with my phone. Took a bit of wrangling, but I eventually got it.

I was so friggin happy, I turned to leave the aisle, only to see the woman from earlier staring at me with disgust.

0,"AITA? - I Got Someone Fired for Calling a Female Worker the C Word, but he Said it to me in Private. | Context: This happened many years ago while I was at my first job at a movie theater. I was 17 years old and so was everyone else involved in the story, except our manager. I have always thought about this and feel bad for the kid, I would just like to know if people think I'm an AH or if I did the right thing.

I used to work at a movie theater restaurant. I was a runner/busser. My fellow department's job was to essentially run out the food and drink, and to clean theaters in between showtimes. We always had a team lead that was in charge of the department for the day - they would basically direct who would clean what theaters and who would run out drinks and food unless a manager intervened, which was uncommon. There would be anywhere between 5-20 of us on at any given time.

That night, it was fairly quiet. This girl, I'll call her Kendall (16 F) was our team lead for the night. She was a great worker, but could be bossy I suppose, but not if you were cordial with her. I was working with her and about 7 other bussers that night. This dude, I'll call him Lance (16 M) was fairly new to the theater. It was maybe his 6th week on the job or so. He was already pissing off managers by taking forever to run out food or drink (he was fairly heavyweight and did not have the best work ethic).

Well this night, Lance was being told what to do by Kendall and did not seem to enjoy this very much. She was a good leader and would make sure we weren't screwing around. She continuously kept good tabs on Lance, and often told him what to do when we were bussing the theaters (sweep, wipe, leave to help run food, etc.) Well Lance was getting pretty fed up it would seem. After finishing a theater, he and I were standing outside together. Kendall comes up and tells him to head down to another theater to start cleaning. ""What a Cu\*t"" he says to me as she walks away. He didn't intend for her to hear ( I don't think), but still I was caught off guard as she was our leader for the night and he was so new there.

About 10 minutes later Kendall and I were cleaning the theater, Lance was off doing something else. This was annoying Kendall. I decided to let her know what he said about her, since I knew her for months and she was a buddy of mine, Lance was not. Kendall did not approve of this, and she went and told our Manager. Within 20 minutes, Lance was fired.

The managers were not impressed with Lance, and the job did have a high turnover due to the constant crowds and running around all over the place the entire dinner rush on weekends. I believe that if he wasn't fired for this, he may have been fired for something else sooner rather than later. But, that is just my opinion.

1,"AITA for getting this waitress fired | I was out with my wife and teenage daughter. 

Teenage daughter has a shellfish allergy. 

She ordered a pasta dish that was topped with scallops. It was described as “linguine in cream sauce topped with scallops” 

She said “can I get this without the scallops I am highly allergic to shellfish.” 

Waitress said no problem. Great. 

Food comes to the table and I don’t see any scallops but I detected a really fishy smell and insisted my daughter wait. I tasted it, the sauce definitely had seafood in it. I asked the waitress what was in the sauce and she said she’d ask. She comes back and is rattling off the ingredients — chief among them — oysters. 

I flipped out and demanding to see a manager. It took a while to unpack it all but what we learned was the waitress told the kitchen to leave the scallops off but didn’t say our party had a shellfish allergy. 

My daughter could have gone into anaphylactic shock. I was irate. I just kept thinking what could’ve happened if she’d been eating here alone or with friends who didn’t know she was allergic. 

I let loose on the manager, saying basically “this could have gotten my kid killed. I want to know what you’re going to do about it. We told our waitress she was allergic.” He fired the waitress. 

I thought they’d do something like add an allergen warning to their menu or instruct the staff to ask if tables had an allergy but honestly I was happy they fired her. I figured it would be a good lesson for her. 

But now I’m looking back on it and wondering if I should have taken it that far. On the one hand, it was so dangerous what they did. On the other, it is a person’s livelihood.

1,"AITA for refusing to measure out, weigh, portion, etc all of the food I cook just because my wife is on a diet? | I have a feeling I might get dinged for a couple of things but hear me out. I'm not some thoughtless asshole, for one. But here's the deal. My wife started getting kind of fat so we talked about her trying to lose weight. When she met, she was around 125lbs and she has ballooned up to 145lbs, which at her height of just over 5 feet tall, that's pretty large. I agreed she should lose weight, and she set to work.

Except this somehow means that when I cook, I have to follow all of these rules. I have to weigh things on a food scale, write it down, portion it out, pick certain ingredients, not use others, etc. It takes the fun out of cooking and it's honestly obsessive and over the top to me. I don't think that I should have to do that just because she's trying to lose the weight.

In my eyes, she can just see what went into the meal and then properly portion out her serving on her own. But writing it all down and having to stop to measure and weigh things so she can ""track it"" makes it extremely aggravating for me. 

Not just that, but she's also refusing to go out to eat, to the bar to hang out, etc, because she won't know how to log it or track or whatever. So there cuts down on our social life. I told her that she can just skip the alcohol or only drink vodka sodas. She said that wasn't fun and I told her that her time to pick ""fun"" happened before she put on the weight. She said that wasn't very nice of me, and I told her that while I love her, it is a disappointment when someone lets themself go like she has. She agreed to keep working, but told me I should be more supportive and help her out. 

For the record yes I am a lot less attracted to her, but I would never tell her that. But AITA for not wanting to take up all of my time and change how I cook just because she can't stop eating?",False,False
1,"AITA for getting frustrated when a guest ruined my 3D print | My roommate and I had some friends over after class, one of them being a girl who’s on the heavier side. She’s super nice and all.

I’m printing something for a project for my final and it’s 2 parts. The first part finished earlier that day and the second part is a 26 hour print. It had been printing for 8 hours by the time everyone was over. 

We are all standing around talking and she gets near the printer walking backwards. She’s been over numerous times and while the printer isn’t loud, it’s not exactly fucking quiet.

I was gonna say something but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt that she knew it was behind her.

Then she stepped on it. Now it’s not in an enclosure but it was printing on the front of the bed so she didn’t damage anything that I know of.

She apologized and I said it was cool. I checked the print and it was a little wonky, but figured it could have been like that. 30 minutes later they leave to run to the store, and I check the print better. It caused a significant shift in the layers, so the print is ruined. 

She wasn’t there anymore but I was complaining about how that was 8 hours and material wasted. I was upset, and I feel that’s a normal reaction to this. My roommate started telling me to chill out, which made me even more frustrated. He took the part of the counter and threw it away.

I grabbed it out of the trash can and started seeing if maybe I could still use it somehow. I decided to Atleast see how my diaroma will look with all the parts, so I start cleaning the supports off the failure.

I was upset when they came back over because that was 8 god damn hours wasted, but she was already embarrassed and I didn’t want to bring it up. She did ask me if it was the failure I was working on and if she caused it, but I said no and that I had made an error earlier and had to revise the model, as to not be rude.

My roommate still thinks I’m an asshole for being upset and frustrated and for talking about it after she left. I was just trying to be sensitive, and I can be a lot more freaked out that someone nearly ruined my very expensive machine.

0,"AITA for using gym equipment someone else was using? | I (20 M) go to the gym after work at 5:30pm, and have done for the past year or so and this has become part of my routine. 

For some background, the gym isn’t the biggest but it’s the most reasonably priced within my local area it’s also short walk from my workplace and many other offices. Because of this factor, the gym is extremely busy from 5-7pm on week nights. 

Today, I was in the gym and went towards what I thought to be a free bench press. There was still weights on each side of  the barbell, so I visibly had a quick glance around to see if anyone was using it and come to the conclusion that someone had just not bothered taking the weights off each side, annoying but no big deal. 

I sit down to start my set when a guy stands over me, then tells me he was already here and would be no longer than 5 minutes. Again no big deal, I assumed he just went for water etc and had just got back. Fine, I move. 

He then goes back to using the free weights and a bench. Now I understand during quiet periods people do occasionally use multiple machines at once but this gym is packed. 

This is where I’m unsure if I became the asshole, but fuck that guy I’m using the bench I went and sat back down. He didn’t notice for around a few minutes, but quickly went out his way and  asked me to move once he noticed. I explained it was busy, I wanted to finish my set before leaving which I did. He suggested I was just trying to ‘piss him off’

1,"AITA for letting my son's friends smoke weed at our house? | My son is 17. The first time we caught him with weed in his room last year it was a big deal, to his mom/my wife. She flipped out, destroyed it, ""threw"" him out the house which lasted maybe a day. But we quickly came to terms with the idea of him smoking. 

Since nothing we could do would ever stop him, we told him he was allowed to smoke downstairs in the basement. Our thought process being, there he has no chance of getting in trouble or fucking his life up in anyway. 

This eventually led to his friend's joining. Our house is popular as the house they can smoke in without any fear of repercussions. We don't micromanage the basement, as we have trust in our son to do the right thing. 

Well tonight one of the mom's of the kids got in touch with me asking me if it was true I let her son smoke in our house. I told her we don't keep track of everybody that comes over but it was possible. She snapped and said I had no right to allow her child to smoke. I told her the kid is going to smoke regardless of what she says, because he's already doing it, and that this was the best thing for them so none of them would fuck up their futures with a stupid weed charge or getting into any type of trouble.

I said making it as an author is impossible in this day in age anyways, and that she will never, ever make it a professional author.

The next day I took it into work and used an angle grinder to cut through the lock and remove it. That got a couple people looking and asking what I was up to, did I steal that? I said kind of, it was my bike, it got stolen, but I stole it back.

She asked me and eldest to clean once a week and she decided to do rest with help of other kids. We did it one week and then I ordered those tablet you put in flush tank. She did not like that and asked all of us to at least sit to pee so that she wouldn’t need to clean often. I laughed at it first but she meant it.

0,"AITA for removing my assigned partners name from our project causing her to fail the class and most likely get kicked out of school? | So i'm a senior CS major who is on track to graduate this spring. One of the classes I took this year was an advanced computer operating systems class that required us to build a OS for our final project. The class has been a good experience and while it was extremely tough, I enjoyed it. This is where Karen comes in.

&#x200B;

I met Karen a year ago in a computer architecture class and I've disliked her since. She is lazy and barely passes every class she takes. I took a class with her last summer and from what her lab partners said about her, she did nothing on their projects.

&#x200B;

So when our final projects were coming the teacher decided to have us work in pairs on our OS's and present them together. I was unfortunately assigned Karen as my partner. I asked the teacher if I could work alone but she insisted I try and make it work.

&#x200B;

As I expected, Karen did nothing. For the past month I have worked my ass off while she has blown me off countless times and refused to do anything. Towards the due date I decided to remove all the code I did from the shared drive and she freaked out. She sent me harassing texts and calls. She also left a very threatening voice mail saying she would report me to the teacher and claim she did all the work.

&#x200B;

Well, the day after I went to the teacher and showed her all the work I had done and the texts/voicemail. I gave her copies of all of them and she told me I could remove her name from the project and present it myself. Well, last week Karen learned she would be receiving a 0 on the project and failing the class. Since then she has been trash talking me to everyone claiming I ""cheated her.""

Along with that, today I was informed that my teacher went to the administration with the texts and voicemail. Along with this, another student has reported her for degrading posts on social media.

Then when I was 17, I got a job and bought my own phone. It wasn't a very good phone, but it was new at the time and since I bought it with my own money, I treasured it. I was under the mindset that my parents weren't allowed to do anything to it because I bought it and not them. Yet again, 2 years later, my mom intentionally broke it.

I began arguing that we don't live there anymore and I'm allowed to do anything I want. Long story short, my mom got mad at me and smashed the vase on the dinner table.

1,"AITA for wanting to cut off contact with a friend and the widow of a late friend because they're dating now? | Title is horrible but hear me out.

I've been hanging out with this group of friends for about 11 years. Some I met during college and others got into it as the years went by. Last year we lost one of our friends, Michael, because of a cardiac arrest. Michael was married, had been for 4 years and knew his wife for even longer than that. In our same group there is Adam, who was friends with Michael since high school and got into our group at the same time Michael did. 

Now the issue that is the reason behind this post is that Adam has told us a couple days ago that he's dating Michael's widow. We were all surprised by this because we never saw it coming. After Michael died we all did our best to provide comfort and support for her, Adam included, but as far as we knew and as far as he told us at the time they were just hanging out/having talks when she needed. Now we get to find out they have been getting to know each other better for at least 6 months. When Michael has been dead for 1 year and 4 months. 

This has split the group in three. The ones that believe that they should be allowed to do whatever they want and don't see a problem with it. Then the ones that believe he's taking advantage of Michael's widow. And the ones that think they're both wrong and also don't want to be around Adam and her anymore.

I'm with the last group. Yes, everyone deals with grief in different ways but this doesn't sit right with me and I also think it's just a tasteless thing to do. Me and others have said that we would not keep hanging out with Adam and also we would not keep in touch with Michael's widow. If they were free to do whatever they wanted they also should deal with the consequences of this. So, are we being assholes in this? ",False,False

I've been sort of friends/ acquaintances with this woman (we'll call her Nikki) on and off for...decades, honestly. She's never been mentally stable in the entire time I knew her, but she has a job and everything. We have some mutual friends, but I don't speak to them much. She's a few years older than me, and we're both in our 30s.

We ended up reconnecting about 7 months ago and we ended up having a short fling. FWIW, I used a condom and didn't ask her about birth control. Lo and behold, she gets pregnant and is about 5 months along now. I assumed she'd do what any rational person would do and terminate. We don't know each other that well and when we did, things were often very hostile. We fell out of contact and remained Facebook friends this time.

Nope. Nikki is THRILLED. She ended up announcing on Facebook first, not even telling me directly first. It was a rehashing of her previous family life and how it ended tragically, and how she's excited for a new start and she's so grateful that the universe gave her this gift. Turns out, a lot of her friends and family agreed with this. All of the comments were along the lines of expressing happiness and that she deserves this after all the suffering she's been through. Apparently, she'd been married before, over a decade ago, and lost both her son as a baby and her husband right after.

I messaged her that she needs to be rational about this, that we don't know each other or get along, that I never agreed to have a child with her and that nobody ""deserves"" a baby at any cost. She sent me a curt response that just said that I was tainting her happiness and stressing her out, and immediately blocked me from messenger, but I can still see her Facebook (although I'm sure that will change).

A few days ago my sister's brother in law comes back to town while I was over at my sister's place. The kids were using my Netflix account during the day. Later in the afternoon they went out and so I used the TV to watch some shows. 

When the kids came back they insisted I get off the TV and let them resume their show. I told them I was still watching something and told them to wait but they kept pestering me every 5 minutes and kept demanding I switch back to their cartoons. 

This time I told them that they were using my account and should be respectful as I could take away their access if I wanted to. My sister sided with them and insisted I let them watch their show. Funnily enough, in that moment my Netflix account experienced an error and kicked us off the account. My sister assumed I removed access and lightly accused me of not wanting the kids to use my account. 

She asked me to leave her house so I went home. When I got home the account worked again so she realized I had not kicked them off my account but I decided to discuss the issue with her. I told her I did not kick them off but I could have done it if the kids were going to continue disrespecting me. My sister believes I should have just brushed of their bad bahavior.

When Rachel fell pregnant she told everyone that they would be waiting until the baby was born to find out the gender, wich really didn't suit any of my family and especially not me as I would like to buy little bits and pieces for baby as the months go not suddenly find out and have to buy everything at once.


Knowing my sister who is extremely impatient in all matters , I knew she would end up getting a gender scan even if she didn't tell her husband Nick. 

So every day i would sent her a message asking if she knew yet and would drop the question in to conversation. 


She told our mom I was driving her insane with the constant asking but I think it's 1000% normal to be excited to know if you'll have a niece or nephew and to begin baby clothed shopping.

Anyway fast forward to Rachel being 17 weeks pregnant,  I sent her a text asking if she knew yet and lo and behold she text back saying yes she had a scan and it was a girl.

I was through the roof with excitement but then Rachel text me again to say that she wanted gender neutral gifts only.

She was extremely adamant about the gender neutral gifts so i did 80% neutral and jut got a few pink dresses and frilly pink sleep suits as they were gorgeous.

Fast forward to 36 weeks,  Rachel drops bomb number 2.
She sends a group message on whatsapp to say that as she will be needing a c section because her baby is breech she only wanted herself and Nick at the birth.

I asked her if she was joking and she said no, so I wasn't even allowed to attend the birth of my future neice.

She tried to talk me round via text saying she was terrified and that she wanted peace and quiet for her c section and said although I don't mean to i talk alot in exiting situations. 

I found that incredibly insulting but dropped the issue as she wouldn't budge. 

And then comes the ultimate bombshell, 2 days later Nick calls to announce the arrival of my nephew,  not neice,  nephew. 

Rachel never got a gender scan, instead she told me it was a girl to stop me asking her every day.
And she lied about her due date so I wouldn't be on labour watch and turn up at the hospital. 

I've refused to see the baby because I am distraught my neice never existed, I demanded that she give the gifts back as they are for a baby girl but she said no and sent me a pic of the baby in a pink frilly sleep suit! 

I know gender neutral is a thing but these are full on girly clothes, Rachel said she doesn't care if he wears girl's clothes because it doesn't matter.

0,"AITA for refusing to participate in my kid’s school project? | My 5th grader’s math class is trying to tie the curriculum to the real world by doing a unit with budgeting math and percentages. 

My daughter came home and asked how much our mortgage was, how much we spent on utilities, and what percent of my income was going into savings. 

I’m more than happy to discuss the age appropriate details of family finances with her privately, but not if she’s going to go to school and talk about it with the whole world. 

I asked her if she actually cared what the mortgage was or how much we were saving and she said no. I figured, good, she’s 10, I worked hard so she wouldn’t have to worry about that yet. 

I told her to tell her teacher I had declined to participate and he should assign her a hypothetical budget to use.  

I almost just made up some answers for her but I wanted to draw a clear line of disapproval with this project and being asked this private information. I didn’t want to send in a fake set of numbers and have them be assumed as real, either. 

Her teacher called me in and belittled me for not helping my daughter with the project or being composed enough to have “tough conversations” with her and depriving her of this learning opportunity.

This was not the case.  Maybe it's just Charlotte NC fans, but I doubt it. I don't know what the problem was but everybody was on their asses the whole night. So I'm like, alright that's cool. Sorry to the people behind us but I'm gonna dance respectfully.  We were about center stage, halfway back in the pavilion.  

The family in front of us looked like they'd mistaken this show for a candle lit vigil, and I didn't want them to have a bad time or anything so I kept it chill.  It was a middle aged father and wife with two teenage daughters and a younger son. They gave me a few looks but managed to ignore me. 

Then the band covered Bulls on Parade (Rage Against the Machine). For anyone who doesn't know, it's not a sitting down type of song.  I'd been holding back all night and just went a little bit wild when this one came on. So was the band!

I ordered a drink and 2 more plates, then chatted with my family for a bit as I hadn’t seen most since Mother’s Day. 

I then pay, get in the car and my husband asked immediately “how much did it cost?” I told him it was $38 including my drink (not a tipping country so not applicable). He asked if I ate 11 plates, grilled me on how many plates there were, why did it cost so much money? I said there were about 9 plates when done so he and had 4 each and one for our toddler.

I know money had been a bit tight, but I worked an extra shift to cover this outing. I tried to not eat much.

I hate the name. I told her nicely that I don't like it. She loves the name, thinks it's beautiful, and the girls will have cute similar names. 

She was really angry, and told me it's their right to pick whatever name they want. I understand and respect that. I didn't ask them to change their minds, or anything. I discussed it with my counselor who advised that I ask to find a cute nickname. My daughter was even more offended, said no, I have to call the baby by their chosen name. I can't even use her middle name, which is nice.

She went online for opinions to a moms' group who supported her. One poster going as far as to advise her that either I get in line, or I don't get to be in the baby's life.

0,"AITA for not thanking my brother-in-law for buying me dinner after we had an argument? | 21F, BIL is 30. I’ve had issues with him for a long time: classic immaturity, narcissism, likes to intentionally provoke me.

Tonight, he noticed the rubbish bin oveflowing onto the road. 

He says, “There’s rubbish all over the road because SOMEONE doesn’t know how to put the rubbish in the bin properly”. 

It was my fault, but I’m annoyed that he seriously can’t come in and say, “There’s rubbish on the road because you didn’t put the rubbish in properly. Can you clean it up?” 

I retort, and that’s that. We move to another room with my sister, I’m a little moody at this point. I knew he would keep prodding, as he usually does.

He spends the next 10 minutes giggling, “Why is it in a mood? What did I do? What’s its problem?”
Yes, he refers to me as “it”. This annoys me even more. He pokes and pokes. I don’t respond. He leaves the room, my sister asks what’s wrong. I tell her I’m annoyed with how he acted. He comes back in, she tells him, he goes on to make more jokes about it. Giggling, he picks up his toddler son and says things like, “Your aunty doesn’t know how to put rubbish in the bin, does she?”

He repeats this multiple times and can’t seem to drop it. Sister is defending me at this point, telling him he’s being a dick, needs to stop etc. At some point, he walks to the kitchen and drinks Coke straight out of the bottle (which he knows pisses me off). I retreat to my bedroom to nap (prompting a “where’s it going?” from him). 

I’m woken up by my sister who tells me that BIL bought me a pizza for dinner. This seriously fucking shits me. He can’t bring up the bin situation maturely, and now he can’t apologise for it either. He’s not the type of guy who admits when he’s wrong, so the pizza felt more like a twisting of the knife than an apology. 

I don’t touch the pizza on account of me being stubborn. Sister tells me I should say thanks. I tell her I’m not hungry. She tells me I should still say thanks and that I’m being rude. I explain to her that I’m still pissed, she tells me I need to take a joke and that I’m being sensitive. It’s funny how she was defending me at the time but has now done a complete 180. I’m the bad guy now. 

After a few more back and forths, she tells me it’s his way of apologising and that I should thank him. This just makes me angrier. I don’t understand why she’s suddenly enabling him again. What happened to actual, adult apologies? I know that he doesn’t feel bad for his actions. I didn’t want to accept this pizza, so I didn’t say thank-you. I wanted an apology, not a pizza. I said to my sister, if he wants a thank-you he can come here and apologise first. 

TL;DR: My BIL provokes me, I’m visibly upset. He buys me a pizza, I was still mad and refused to accept it. He never actually apologised, so I never thanked him for the pizza. I didn’t eat it.

1,"AITA for intentionally misleading cheaters so they fail? | So, history is my weakest subject, and I had a 78% in AP US. Overall, my grades all follow the same trajectory: low at the beginning, as I'm just coming out of a break, and then getting better and better until the final exam, which I ace. APUSH exemplifies this. What I usually do is bring it up to a B and then kill the final, which is worth a huge portion of our grade (relative to other classes). However, with online school, final exams are cancelled. We had only 2 big tests other than the final, but I knew I'd have to get like a 120% on both of them to get an A, which is obviously impossible given my teacher usually doesn't give extra credit.

&#x200B;

So I figured out a plan: sometimes, if there's a low class average on a test, the teacher curves the test by so many points-- the lower the average, the more points she adds. If you already have a high scores and the extra points cross the maximum amount on the test, they're just entered as extra credit. So if I studied and got an A and then the test was curved, I might be able to get an A.

&#x200B;

However, that means I needed to figure out a way to make a bunch of people fail really bad. I'm in 1st hour, and usually people in later hours rely on 1st hour to tell them exactly what's on the test so they can specifically study that. So I decided, if I fed them the wrong info and got some friends in my hour to play along, I'd mislead them and cause them to do badly. They did, and the test was curved, so I ended up getting a 125.

&#x200B;

I then, with a few friends, went to the teacher and told her how the bad test scores were indicative of online school severely being detrimental to our learning, so in the interest of keeping our grades safe, she should curve the next test as well. I only managed to pull it off because she really likes me (the less good I am at a subject, the more I need to have the teacher like me-- otherwise, I could never pull this stuff off to get an A).

&#x200B;

So basically, I secured an A for the semester, and I'm pretty happy with myself, but the kids in my class who I deliberately misled are fucking pissed about how I caused them to bomb the tests (even with the curve, they mostly only got Ds and Cs that hurt their grade). I think they have no room to complain-- they consistently cheated, and now it just caught up to them. I think they're TAs for cheating.

1,"AITA for thinking my wife is trying to sabotage me? |  

Hello Reddit, my wife recently lost some weight and is back to her pre-baby weight, keep in mind our youngest is 6. I was 320, down to 280 and now back to 300 and I blame my wife.

I have been trying to diet and exercise for some time now. We go to the gym 2-3 times a week. I do most of the shopping and buy good food/no junk food. I will skip the bread, portion my meals better, yada yada yada.

She always goes to Target. Women love Target... Buy Target stock..... and comes home with junk, granola bars, cheeze it’s, chips, ice cream etc. saying it’s for the kid's lunches or summertime snacks.. But if it’s in the house, I will eat it and she knows that. I am trying to tell her kids don’t need those type snacks, but that’s a whole different post.....

She also will go somewhere and call me if I want a snack.. like bring home Frostys for the kids, or stop at McDonald’s, or 7/11. I told her to stop doing that, yet she continues.

She called me last night and asked if I wanted a snack, I yelled no and hung up on her. She was mad. She gets mad when I don’t say goodbye before I hang up... But I had to do that because you know what? I would have said yes.......

1,"AITA for not letting my son go trick or treating? | I am not from the US — would love some insight from people originally from here. 

We just moved to the US this year and it is my son’s first year in school here, all of our first Halloween celebrations. 

My son is in third grade and has been excited to celebrate Halloween. I bought him a costume and we decorated the house and drew on pumpkins, I thought that was enough for him to feel he’d participated. 

I didn’t realize trick or treating was so widespread and thought he’d realize it was a tradition for some families but not ours since we don’t eat much candy, it is raining here, it is a school night, etc. 

Plus I am not very keen on his approaching the neighbors we haven’t met and running around the neighborhood after dark, even if I am with him. 

I told him tonight was not a good night but I’d go to the store and he could pick any candy he wanted. He is *hysterical*. I have not seen him this upset in a long time. 

He went to school and discussed this with his friends and five different moms called and offered to take him out. 

I didn’t want him eating a lot of candy and being exhausted tomorrow so just said “thanks but no thanks” and they were all very surprised and several asked “oh no is he sick” or “did he get into trouble” as though it was unthinkable he wouldn’t go out for this tradition. 

He says all his friends are going out but I cannot tell if it’s the same as “all my friends have the new Nintendo” or “all my friends stay awake until midnight” etc.

0,"AITA For Telling an Engineer to Come Back in 4 Hours? | I told my parents this story and my popps said I was the A but my mum agreed with me.


In my old flat I got permission to install a cheap tumble dryer that I bought second hand. About 18months later the fan in the machine completely melted and I had to buy a replacement.


After a guy came out to look at it he said he'd be able to replace it on the Wednesday of that next week and I got him to tell me (verbally AND via text and email) that he'd be there between 1pm & 5pm.


The next week I'd done an overnight shift on the Tuesday that had ended at 6am. I'd made it to bed at about half 7 and at ten to 9 (approx) someone was buzzing my intercom trying to get into the building. Intermittently, for nearly ten minutes, before I stopped ignoring them (and thinking it was just school kids) and answered it.


It was the engineer.

He said he had the part and just wanted to head in and sort out the tumble drier, I (annoyed) told him it was 9am and he wasn't due until 1pm. He said it'd just be quick and he had a few more jobs to run through in the area and it didn't make sense to do them, leave and come back here later. I said I'd planned my day around him being here in the afternoon and that I was doing other things this morning, that my life didn't revolve around his new schedule and hung up the intercom.


He came back at about 1:30 (I think, I went out about an hour after the call and didn't see him) and things were fairly tense. He did the job in about 30 mins and left.

1,"AITA for getting annoyed at the way my girlfriend reacts to guys touching her? | So I’m in a relationship with a girl I met half a year ago and I love her a lot. 

The only problem is that it seems that in some situations she lacks a backbone. 

Recently she called me in tears about how a work colleague had been constantly playfully touching her up at work. He’s apparently one of those weird people who is touchy with a lot of girls. My girlfriend told me he had touched her a lot more than usual and had even breathed down her neck despite her telling him to stop. She told me that he always does it in such a jokey way that when she tells him to stop he never takes it seriously, although it makes her so uncomfortable it brought her to tears. 

There were incidents before this, apparently her ex also had a massive problem with her colleague. She’s told me that he also honks his horn at 14 year old girls and is a massive creep.

We discussed it and came to the conclusion that next time she saw him she should take him to one side and really tell him how uncomfortable he makes her. She has evidence of him drinking at work so could easily get him fired, thereby using that as ammunition she could get him to take her seriously. I obviously wanted her to get him fired right away but she wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt which is fair enough. 

She had work with the same guy again today but didn’t say anything because she doesn’t want to ‘make a fuss’ or ‘cause drama’.

I should preface this by saying that my husband and I have a baby at home, and we're currently paying for me to finish my masters degree out of town. We're paying for my degree as well as a mortgage AND rent at an apartment. I have my baby with me and my husband visits on weekends which is why I wasn't at the dinner. 

So they have a nice meal. My Dad orders steak, lobster, wine, scotch and dessert. Of course he should, it's his birthday! My husband doesn't drink and only orders dinner. At the end of the meal, the waiter set the bill down in between my husband and my Dad. According to my husband, it was clear my Dad wasn't planning on paying for the meal.

My parents have paid for dinner for us plenty of times, more than we've done for them certainly. But when someone else invites you out to dinner, the expectation is that you at least pay for your own meal. You don't invite someone along so they'll pay for you and your partner's food.

0,"AITA for wanting to break up with my fiance because of his violent and destructive son? | I met my fiance 2 years ago and our love is like a fairy tale, everything seemed so perfect. I met his son when he was 5 years old, he's 7 now. His son, who I will call Josh, was very open and warm to me in the beginning. My fiance was never the best at being a dad to him, but when I came in the picture we changed that. I made sure we had meals together when I was around and we went on trips to the zoo and museum frequently. I would make sure they had ""Josh and Dad"" days, and I would often take him out by myself to arcades or the pool. Everything was going well, but I always noticed defiance in Josh. He fights everything. He lies about everything. His mom says he's 100x worse at her house, and I know there is some tension in their home so I expected that.

Josh is very destructive, more than the average 7 year old I believe. I invited my fiance to come live with me after about a year of dating. I have two extra rooms so I figured we could fix one up for Josh. Josh comes over every weekend, and every weekend piece of my furniture is either broken completely or destroyed in some way (colored on, buttons ripped off, holes poked or cut in things). When confronted about these things he will lie and lie even if we caught him in the act. Josh will steal from his friends, from his school, and from us. Josh stole $100 from my purse last week when his dad confronted him he said ""Well, if I can't have it, you can't either!"" And ripped the bill in half.

Josh is violent, I have had to put all his play guns/swords too high for him to reach because when he has them he shoots people in the face or beats them with his swords. We had my grandparents over for dinner one time and he managed to get his guns and shoot them in the face during dinner. He is often screaming that he wants to kill things. My dog is currently staying at my mother's because when Josh comes over he will lock the dog in the bathroom or outside for hours on end. Josh would chase my dog with big sticks and everytime he walked in the door my (usually very friendly) dog would run away or pee. 

My fiance and I recently found out I was pregnant. Josh acted out tremendously when he was told. I ended up losing the baby 3 months in and Josh was so happy about this... Often telling me ""I'm glad the baby died. I don't want any siblings."" Or ""It's good that your body can't make babies right. I hate babies."" This was basically the breaking point for me. We have tried tough love, open arms, therapy, all of it. Nothing seems to change or get through to this boy. I understand he's 7 and coming from a broken home is always damaging. But, at the end of the day he's not biologically mine and I have been feeling more and more disconnected and really feel no love for him at this point. Not only is it unfair for me, but it's unfair for my fiance AND his son. It's exhausting and fills me with anxiety whenever my husband leaves to pick him up. I feel like I hold my breath all weekend. 

I would never make ANYONE choose between their child and their SO. And even if I did, I would be disappointed if someone chose their SO over their kid.

1,"AITA for being honest in how I felt about my teammate? | So I \[35M\] have been playing a coed sport with the same group of people for almost 6 years. About 4 years ago, a new girl, “Tori,” \[27F\] joined our team. She’s a good athlete and she fit in well with the group, so pretty soon she was also being invited to social events with the team. Over the past few years she’s gotten really close to some of the women on the team, including one of my best friends, Jenna \[29F\], and started dating another guy on the team, Alex.  

Here’s the thing – I really dislike Tori. Something about her just rubs me the wrong way. She’s pretty good-looking and I get the impression that she knows it – I feel like she thinks she’s better than everyone. But everyone else seems to really like her so for the most part I kept these thoughts to myself. I see her 2-3 times a week, so I just made my peace with it and was always nice to her because I didn’t want any drama.  

A few months ago, I matched on Tinder with a girl in Tori’s grad school program, “Cat.” We went on a date and Cat mentioned that she’d seen that we had a mutual friend, Tori. I asked Cat what she thought of Tori and Cat was like “she’s great, I really like her, why do you ask?” I told Cat, basically, that I really dislike Tori and that she seems like kind of a bitch. I generally consider myself an honest person and I was just really tired of pretending to like Tori. 

Things fizzled out with Cat and I honestly forgot about that conversation. So last weekend I showed up to our sports game and said hi to everyone. I noticed that Tori didn’t respond super enthusiastically (she was like “oh, hey…”) so I asked her what was up and she said “nothing.” I hate it when people are obviously lying to me so I asked her what her deal was. She finally looked at me and said “Cat told me that you massively shit talked me on your date. I thought you were my friend and I’m honestly pretty upset, so I’d appreciate if you could just leave me alone.” She said this in front of the entire team and her tone was really aggressive and bitchy. I was pretty pissed and said something like “sorry, but Cat asked me what I thought and I was just being honest about my feelings.” 

Since then everyone on the team has been telling me that I’m a huge asshole and are basically telling me that I should apologize to Tori or consider taking a break from the team. I’m surprised because (1) I’ve been on the team for longer, and (2) Tori didn’t need to call me out like that in front of the whole team. I honestly assumed that some of my friends felt the same way, so I can’t believe they’re actually siding with Tori. AITA? 

TL;DR: I can’t stand this woman on my sports team (Tori) but I’ve always been nice to her to keep the peace. Went on a date with her friend and was honest in my assessment of Tori’s personality. Tori couldn’t handle it and called me out in front of the whole team. AITA?",False,False

0,"WIBTA if I asked friend who peed on my couch to pay $850 to replace cushions | Throwaway bc this is embarrassing 

A friend was in town yesterday and asked if he could crash on my couch. I said no problem, he’s stayed here before. When he showed up, he’d been out drinking and was completely trashed. I wasn’t thrilled but it was already like 10 at night so it wasn’t like he could find another place to stay. I was legitimately worried he was going to throw up on my floor but it actually turned out even worse. 

In the morning he told me, very embarrassed, that he’d been so drunk that he wet himself and it got all over my couch, including soaking through the fabric to the cushion itself. He offered to put the covers in the washing machine but it’s a velvet couch so you can’t do that. He said he would pay me whatever it costs to get it professionally cleaned. 

I called a professional upholstery cleaner and they said since it had gotten through to the cushion there was nothing they could do, and even if they cleaned the fabric it wouldn’t likely remove any smell. I also called the store where I’d gotten the couch and they said basically the same thing. 

It sounds like at this point cleaning is not an option and the only choice is to replace the cushions. The store told me that replacement cushions would be $430 each, so $860 total. 

I feel awful asking him to pay such a huge sum of money. Another friend suggested I split it with him but I don’t think I should be on the hook for over $400 when I was the one doing him a favor letting him stay here. WIBTA if I asked him to pay the full amount?",False,False

0,"AITA for getting mad when my boyfriends family brings up ex’s and how he likes other women? | Throw away as our friends know my regular. 

It’s been a common theme that every time I (27f) go over to my boyfriends (Gary 27) families house or meet with them, that they (his mother and stepdad) mention an ex or him and another woman in some context “Gary loves big boobs” or “yeah, Gary really loves blondes haha” both of which, I do not posses, or more realistic references pertaining to his life. 
The last dinner, his childhood fling was brought up, her Facebook was brought up and shown to me and how well she is doing in life. This evening, we were celebrating thanksgiving as part of the family will be out traveling during then. Then out came a comment referencing a girl in his (Gary) friend group, stating that if the said friend wasn’t dating so and so(Gary’s friend), it would have been Gary she ended up with. Then proceeded to make comments about how Gary felt about said friend back then. (We’ve been together 5 years) Gary had to awkwardly make his way through the conversation. 
I got upset over it tonight, I did not think that I was appropriate conversation to bring to the table, especially during our thanksgiving dinner. 
There are many more examples than the two or three minimal ones stated in this post, and I’ve dealt with them all with a chuckle when it’s a joke and I just generally go along with the conversation when it’s something deeper, such as showing me the childhood fling thing. 
I trust Gary, and I love Gary and I’m not generally an overtly jealous person, although I am a human being. I just felt sort of disrespected at the table and I expressed it to my boyfriend who has stated that that’s just how SD is.

0,"AITA for not wanting my flowers stolen? | So backstory- basically I’m adopted. My mom and dad had two children and one died from a peanut allergy when she was a young teen. Anyways, since then they put flowers on her grave and visit it at least every month. I also am still living with my parents and am not going into personal details about my living situation other than that. 

So around April 2018 I wanted some flowers for my bathroom. Fake flowers. Never had any in my bathroom growing up when every family member in the house had them. I figured why not make my own bouquet? So I went to Michaels and picked out very detailed, realistic, extravagant flowers with long stems. They were beautiful and $17 each with tax which is a lot for one flower and I bought 3 since they were big enough to fit the vase. 

Anyways, fall came and in September I took those out and put some fall ones in. I put the nice ones in my closet on some racks I had so they wouldn’t get crushed. 

When fall went away I decided I missed the flowers and figured I didn’t need to decorate my bathroom for Christmas. I went to get them and they were gone. I searched my entire closet, bedroom, and even under my bed. I asked my mom if she had seen them. I asked my dad. Nothing. 

Years go by and I finally got myself some new flowers. They’re pretty....but weren’t as pretty as the originals and they stopped selling the original flowers at Michaels. These looked like very obvious fabric flowers. I still would ask every 6 months if she had seen them, showing pictures. 

Well, just this morning, I was in the garage and saw the bag that has the flowers that usually goes to my mom’s daughter’s grave. I noticed a familiar flower. I opened the bag up and found all three. The petals were bent, crumpled, and the stems were covered in dirt. That’s $51 down the drain in flowers that I only paid that much because I thought they’d last years. I didn’t even get half a year with them. 

I was angry and confronted my mom about lying. I remember exactly were I put my flowers, I NEVER would have put them in a dusty garage, and no one else but her ever goes in my room. Which meant she purposely took them and put them in the garage. Probably forgot they were mine and used them in for her grave. 

She got defensive, said I must have put them in the garage and “why does it matter so much?” I asked why there was dirt and she said she stuck them in the ground around her daughter’s grave. I was shocked. She called me selfish. Asked me why can’t I share with her dead daughter. 

I was angry because I’ve been asking her for years with pictures if she’s seen my flowers. And there’s no way she could mistake mine for hers- mine had giant long stems and vert detailed while the flowers my mom uses for her grave are those bundled fake pink roses you get at the dollar store that they keep out front.

1,"WIBTA if I told my daughter to find a different hobby? | My daughter Ann (17)  has been obsessed with building miniatures ever since she saw Hereditary a few months back. Since then, she has probably spent close to 500 dollars on miniature sets from Amazon, Hobby Lobby, and etsy. All of this money comes from her job at a local movie theatre, so I can't exactly cut her off. 

I can't explain why, but something about it drives me up the \*\*\*\*ing wall.  Maybe it's because Toni Collette was so creepy? Maybe I just want to spend some quality time with my daughter instead of  watching her waste her life in her bedroom. I hear my sister talk about dropping her daughter off at soccer, or how her son's the lead in the school play, and then think about how my daughter's upstairs building a tiny cottage with tweezers. She hasn't ever really shown interest in any hobbies before, so I thought it would be grateful that she's finally good at something, but mostly I'm just annoyed. Her grades are fine (Bs), her chores are always done, but mostly every second of her spare time is spent putting together miniatures. I try to ask her if she'd like to go for a walk with me, or sign up for cheerleading, but she always says no. My husband thinks its sweet and has started letting her put them around the house and in his office at work.  Every day, I drink coffee next to a 60 dollar miniature greenhouse, and think about when the last time I had a genuine conversation with my daughter that didn't revolve around the merits of craft glue versus hot glue was.

0,"AITA for getting my roomate's boyfriend kicked out and am forcing them to keep thier cat in thier room? | I moved into a shared student apartment a week ago. As our lease says, the rooms are single occupancy and animals are not to be kept in the common areas so I know I'm in the 'right', I just want to know if what I did was a dick move. It is also a female-only apartment.

I live with international students (relevant because of communication issues) who all know each other. At the time this all happened I only guessed they knew each other since it was hard to talk to them. At first, everything was ok. My roommates were clean, quiet and seemed nice enough. We didn't talk at all but that's to be expected with cultural and language barriers. It was hard to talk with them but I'm sure that went both ways.  Then, 2 days ago I went to leave the apartment and saw a ton of boxes and a guy in the house. All my roommates were hanging out in the living room talking, w/e. I assumed he was just a friend helping one move in. Later that night I heard hissing under my door. I left to check it out and realized that they had left their cat in the common area. This wouldn't normally be a big issue but I have a cat in my room (why I choose this unit since it was animal-friendly) who was hiding in my closet to avoid the hissing cat. This cat then spent the next two days hissing at me and the cat in my room. I was also worried because there are now claw marks on the couches in the common area which I would also be liable for since I also have a cat.

That night I was kept up by male voice until 3 am. That morning I saw the guy in the kitchen and was going to try to figure out what was going on with him and the cat. I said hello and he literally said nothing and walked right past me into the bedroom. I was overtired, feeling ostracized like I didn't even live there and a little panicky (I specifically chose a female-only suit over co-ed because living with guys I don't know makes me very panicky) so I immediately contacted the management.  Management sent out a letter and the next day the guy comes up to me and confirm that he lives with his girlfriend, that the cat is a 'shared' cat and that no one else cares that he is there or the cat is there. Well, I care and I told him that I have as much right as any other person (ie his friends) about what happens int eh common area. I then told the manager what he said and she got the ball rolling to have him forcibly kicked out next week.

Why I feel like I may be the asshole: he started begging me to let him stay (even offered to pay me), said he would be homeless, that he didn't know the lease because he was an international student etc. On top of that, I'm not even a week into my 12-month lease and I'm sure every roommate in my appt currently hates me because he will be kicked out/evicted within the next 7 days and there cat is now being kept in the bedroom.",False,False

I don’t work on base (there’s no gate or check point to get through) , so we get a lot of civilians in our store, but the majority of our customers are military in uniform. 

Today, I had just come on shift when one of my associates came back to the office to tell me that one of our regulars had come in and she was acting strange. She looked like she was falling asleep/phasing in and out of reality, and she had been walking around the store for like 30-45 minutes. This particular customer comes in fairly often, and she isn’t always the most polite customer, but she doesn’t cause trouble. She was in full uniform and obviously completely trashed on some sort of substance. 

I learned from the morning supervisor that this customer had been passed out in her car in the lot all morning and when the morning supervisor had checked on her to make sure she was okay she drove off. This was the second time she had been to the store today, but she hadn’t come in before. 

We let her leave the store because we can’t hold her if she doesn’t do anything wrong (like try to steal) but as soon as we saw her getting into her car we took down her plates and immediately called the military dispatch center. We notified them of her behavior and let them know that she was driving under the influence. 

They immediately dispatched three or four cars to try to intercept her, but it turns out she didn’t get very far. Trying to get onto the nearest freeway ramp (which we can see out our store windows) she ran right into a pole.

1,"AITA for posting and printing a family picture my SIL ""nixed""? | So upfront, I'm not crazy about my brother's wife. She's kind of a princess, more than a little icy/aloof, and we've never clicked. So I might be less inclined to give her any leeway than I would other family members.

I'm the de facto family photographer and we recently all got together for my niece's first birthday (brother and SIL's daughter). At one point, I gathered everyone together--my parents, my aunts and uncles, my brother and SIL, and my niece--for a collection of photos to commemorate the occasion. 

Later, I was showing my brother the group of photos on my camera and he really liked them. I asked if he had a favorite and he said they all looked great. At this point, SIL was looking over our shoulder and said that she liked pictures 1 and 3, but really hated 4 and 5 because it looked like she had a double chin (she was leaning over to kiss niece on the head and it definitely gives that illusion). 

Well, the problem is that picture number 5 is the only one where my mom looks amazing. My mom is really camera shy and tends to be tense until the very end. It's the only photo where she is smiling and looking like her usual happy, beautiful self. Everyone else looks good and it's only my SIL who is in an unflattering position. So I said I'd think about it, but then later posted that photo on Facebook and got that one printed for my parents' house, as well as to send to my brother. I do a lot of post-processing work and print on my own dime, so it's a lot of work for me.

Well, now my brother says ITA because there were lots of photos that I could have used but I went with one of the ones his wife asked me not to use. Which A) I didn't actually ask her opinion and B) she just looks like she has a little double chin, it's not the end of the world. She's kissing her daughter, it's sweet. But my brother says that it was niece's birthday photo and an important occasion for him and his wife, so SIL's opinion should have been taken into consideration more than usual and that she mattered more than my mom in the pic.

I was quite happy for her since she is really introverted. So after meeting him at a party they decided to exchange their gamertags and started gaming together for a week or so. He invited some of his friend and they play with my girlfriend which doesn't bother me because my GF plays a lot of videogames (she's even better than me) and she used to play with other friends of hers and even played in a clan. She plays videogames for fun though. After playing with him for a couple of times she started telling me how much fun it was and told me what they were talking about while gaming and so on. Somehow I got really jealous not because she was playing videogames with other guys but she was really ehtusiastic about it and kept telling my how cool it was playing with him and his friends.

I have two dogs - both are purebred Weimaraners that I purchased at great expense four years ago. But my girlfriend has been apparently suffering from allergies (which I do not believe are due to the dogs) for the past few months. I do not accept that the dogs are the cause as she has only suffered mild skin irritation since I purchased them up to this point.

My girlfriend is constantly voicing her unwanted opinions on my life. What I do during my personal hours, how I spend my money, and so forth. I have grown weary of defending myself and this was the final straw where I put my foot down in the firmest way yet. I explained to her that I am drained by her incessant demands for me to put her before my dogs and that if she cannot understand the strain she is putting myself and my pets through then she should leave my house.

She became emotional and left to go to her sisters, I think. I have suspicions that she's at another man's house and is using this time to be used as a mattress instead of apologising to me.

1,"AITA for demanding money from a girl who'd lost her phone at my bar the other night when she came to retrieve it? | I own a pub/bar one of many in this highly populated part of my city. So, far too often people lose their phones when they have been drinking and it's up to me and my employees to collect them at the end of a night or to hold onto them if they have been turned in. There is almost a bucket full of them at this current time and more every day. 

Today, a young girl came in to explain she'd lost her phone and has been in contact with one of my girls (Emily) who said she'd put the phone aside for the girl to retrieve it. She gave a description of the phone and we brought it from the safe where Emily had been keeping it for her. I gave the phone to the girl, she unlocked it and began to check the messages she had missed and thanked me. 

I told her that ""people come in here with their thousand dollar phones (it was an iPhone X) lose them, and are quite lucky that my girls go to all the trouble to find their contact information and pass the message along to them that their phone was found at my pub."" I told her that ""due to all the effort that Emily went through you have to give us $20 so that I can pass it along to her. That's the deal."" It's a $1000 phone I'm saving her so $20 should be nothing really. 

She laughed and said ""so long as you actually give it to her and keep it for yourself."" I don't like to have my integrity questioned however I told her I am the owner of the pub I really don't need another $20. It's for my employee who was kind enough to take care of the phone and notify the girl her phone was left at my pub. 

She asked if there's a local ATM and I pointed to the one near the door and after a moment's hesitation she went to the ATM and withdrew the $20 and gave it to me before thanking me and leaving. 

Her boyfriend beside her appeared quite suspicious/critical of me once I demanded the $20 and I saw him talking in her ear when they were walking toward the ATM and due to this I decided I'll check with the people of Reddit.

This includes, paper plates, paper towels, toilet paper, toothpaste, snacks, drinks and anything else that normally would be in cabinets in a house he stores in his closet. 

My brother works and contributes to about 5% of the groceries in the house, my mom supporting us with the other 95% from her retirement fund from the Navy.

I feel absolutely demeaned when I need to keep track and use Monopoly money when I need some dental floss or toilet paper, I use a lot because I get frequent nose bleeds, so I often run out of money and need to use old rags from my garage. 

We’re by no means poor, my mom is just frugal, nowhere to the extent of my brother, but she buys anything we need and we have everything we need but my brother holds it behind his closet and guards it like a security guard, it’s ridiculous.

I told him he’s being a complete asshole and he has a god complex for caring so much about a made up currency. 

My mom has this kind of keep the peace viewpoint with us so she goes along with the system and sneaks me snacks and things that she needs to buy secretly, because my brother waits for our mom to get back from the store by the front door and helps her bring them all up to his room.

0,"AITA For Being Upset Family Won't Let Me Hold New Baby? | Hello everyone, I want some opinions on this because it's been driving me crazy. So my cousin was like a sister to me growing up; we had countless sleepovers, went on family vacations together, we were pretty much always together as children. She was my best friend. As we became teenagers, we kind of drifted apart, but we grew close again not long after she became engaged. I was very involved in helping with her wedding, I was a bridesmaid, went to every shower and party, etc. I thought we were finally getting close again. When she announced her pregnancy, I was thrilled. She and her husband lived about 2 hours away from me, but we got together anytime they were in town, I went down to see them quite a bit during her pregnancy as well, and we always had a good time. She told me the baby's gender before her gender reveal party, and I went out and bought gifts for the reveal and for her later baby shower. She and her husband even asked me to be the baby's godmother. I was honored and so excited for the future.

When the baby was born, I went to see them in the hospital the day after and held the baby for the first time. A few weeks later, once they were settled back at home and ready for visitors, I went down again to spend the day with them and see the baby, where I got to hold him again. Then, about 2 months later, they came to my city for the baby's dedication at their parents' megachurch. They invited me and of course I went to support them. There was a party afterwards, at my cousins' parent's house. I rode back to the house with my cousin and her husband and the baby. I sat in the backseat with my cousin and the baby and during the ride the baby reached out to hold my finger. I thought this was sweet and was enjoying talking to him when my cousin physically moved my hand away then sanitized the baby's hand with glittery Bath & Body Works hand sanitizer. She made me sanitize my hands, too, and though I was a bit taken aback by this, I went with it because I figured it was typical first time mom stuff. When we got to her parent's house, I asked to hold the baby, but my cousin said ""no"" and walked away without another word. I was devastated by this. I was clean, was not sick, and had just washed my hands. A few months later, at a different family gathering, I asked to hold him and was again told no. They recently had their second child and I have not been allowed to hold that baby at all.

My cousin only lets her own parents hold the baby for limited amounts of time under her direct supervision, and routinely says they can only hold their grandchild if they do certain things for my cousin, or if they buy the baby expensive gifts. They have held the brand new baby only once for a Facebook photo. 

At first, I thought it was something I was doing wrong, but I babysit regularly for friends and hold other people's babies all the time, so I'm starting to think it's not a problem with me.

I recently bought a house and it needed some light renovation (sanding floors, painting, that kind of stuff) before I could move in was required for me to move in.

My family and I are very close and help each other out alot. When ever there is some heavy lifting or IT work to do, they call me over. Being a single guy having just bought a house, my family eagerly offered their help doing the renovation.

The problem started as soon as I started talking about what I wanted to do with the place. I wanted to tear down all build in closets, since the house was for a family of four, and I was just a single guy. I did not need closets in every single room, and wanted to concentrate new closets into a single room, to create a walk-in closet. I certanly did not want a huge closet in my new office and home-gym. My parents however insisted that it was a horrible idea to tear out the closets, saying that it would devaluate the house, and that I could never have enough closet space. I retorted that I did not need closet space for a whole family, and that I certanly did not want a closet in every single room regardless of the rooms function.

We got into many heated discussions about these closets in the past month, but in the end I just tore them out, all except one, that I carefully dismantled, with the help of my father - saying that I'd consider putting it up again. In reality I just didn't want to deal with the shitstorm of destroying the closet that my family seemed in love with - I had every intention of throwing it out.

I have started settling into my new place, and the old closet that I dismantled is taking up space. So tonight I mentioned that I had decided to get rid of the last closet. And just as I expected, the whole discussion about the closets started over. My mother said that I ""did not listen to their many years of experience"" and that I ""was ruining my new house"" and that I ""refused to listen to advice or input"".

I started replying with my usual arguments, but ended up loosing my shit (because this was the 10-20th time we had this discussion in 1 month) and loudly stated something along the lines of:

>If I cannot throw out the damn closets, then I shouldn't have bought that damn house in the first place! The whole idea of me buying my own place was to make it my own, not have it dictated by where the previous owners integrated their f\*\*\*\*\*\* closets. Also, you are not giving me advice, you are giving me opinions, and expecting me to follow them.

I also added that the only reason I stored the last closet, was because I did not want to listen to their complaints about the closet any more. My mother was obviously hurt my statements, and went all quiet.

It was a flight that you couldn't reserve your seat online ahead of time, so we purposely got their early so we could request seats with more leg room, or at least things like aisle, window, etc.   I ended up very lucky and got a seat in the front row of my section, so it had much more leg room and was very comfortable.

I felt kind of bad, but at the same time, I purposely went early to get that spot.  Even if they were willing to move me to a comparably comfortable seat, I may have been willing to.

She seemed pretty happy and excited to gossip with me but I got kind of a bad taste in my mouth and said that she probably shouldn’t have told me that.

She immediately got very upset asking me if I was serious and then accusing me of not caring about her and being an inconsiderate asshole because I “ruined it when she was just trying to bond with me”.

0,"AITA for not wanting anything to do with a mentally disabled coworker? | TL;DR: Mentally disabled coworker has exhibited disturbing traits and I will be mean if it keeps him away from me. Coworker thinks he doesnt know any better and I should be nice. 

I work in a big box store. They hired a cart pusher that is mentally disabled, and at first everyone went out of their way to be nice to him. I got very bad vibes tho, and point blank refuse to talk to him. If he addresses me, I pretend not to hear, and go out of my way to avoid him. Something about him rubs me very very wrong. Maybe it sounds dramatic, but he has the glint in his eye of serial killer to me. 

He repeatedly comes up to my coworker who is nice to him and prattles off about how his friend was murdered, in great detail, and some guy shot her. No concept of social norms. Additionally, every time theres a murder of a woman in the news, he has to recite in detail about it. 

He is clearly mentally disabled to the point his mother has to care for him, but he can handle pushing carts. 

I recently found out that in a fit of rage he hit his mother in the face with a hammer. He also openly bragged in the break room that in high school he threatened to hit his teacher and she got scared and it was ""funny"". 

He has a bad habit of coming up to people he doesnt know and just starting conversations. After finding out about the hammer and the teacher threats, I told him that I dont like him, thats why I dont talk to him, and Id appreciate if he would leave me alone. 

Im a young woman and I am fearful that if I'm nice to him because of his disability, that he will percieve it as a crush, and then get mad and potentially hurt or stalk me when I don't reciprocate.

My coworker told me that he's too mentally disabled to control what he says and he doesnt know better so I should at least be nice. I feel like hes a threat, and while I wont be malicious and he has a right to work, I dont want anything to do with him. At. All. I will not be blindly nice because of his disability.

1,"AITA for massaging my guy friend in front of his girlfriend? | I (32F) met my friend (30M) at work last year. We both quit our jobs and became close friends, he introduced me straight away to his girlfriend and this girl is a gem. We hang out a lot the three of us and I love both of them now, even if I knew him first. 

Today, we were hanging out at the beach for the fireworks and my guy friend was in a bad mood. I asked him what was wrong and he said he had a bad headache. I asked him if he wanted me to give him a head massage because I usually give massages to my friends & family.

However, he's pretty tall so I couldn't give it to him while sitting. He then put his head on my laps and I was massaging his head while talking to his girlfriend. I didn't realise it was an uncomfortable situation before seeing the girlfriend's face, which was a bit sceptical. I then quickly put an end to it and sat back at my place.

I'm scared I made her mad, even if she was super nice to me the rest of the evening, I find myself completely stupid for not realising it would be super awkward. 

By the way, I'm dating someone else and I often tell them about my dates and all, so there is absolutely no ambiguity between me & him, and I always see them together, they're a package and I love it.

1,"AITA - This Bud's for you? | My wife works on a community book festival committee that brings in authors from all over the US. She's been doing this for years. It's important to her that the events are successful (i.e., well-attended).

I commented on the Facebook post: ""is this event with the former commissioner really happening at the same time as Game 7 of the World Series?"" 

No one took the extra ticket.

She got all pissed at me, as if a person could exist who recognizes the name ""Bud Selig"" and doesn't know when the World Series is being played.

0,"AITA For locking my roommate and her friend out? | My roommate and her friend have started doing this thing thats really annoying. whenever my boyfriend and I are in our room (dorm room 2 beds, desks, yknow the drill) and my roommate and her friend leave, they leave the door wide open internationally. they laugh and say ""this is what u get"" i assume for showing minimal pda with my bf in my room??

my boyfriend and i arent doing anything, usually just watching netflix in my bed, but like bro privacy?? people in this dorm walk the halls and im uncomfortable with that and she's doing it intentionally to make me feel that way.

tonight she and her friend left the room giggling saying good luck as they left the door open. they do this going in and out of the room like 5 times in an hour. each time i get up and close the door...

i get sick of it on their like 6th trip, so i just lock the door. (i know she has the key, but if i have to go through the hassle of getting up to close the door they can go through the hassle of unlocking it)

anyway the friend comes for their 7th trip and cant open the door and starts banging like crazy. i dont open the door because she knew what she was doing. she went back to wherever her and my roommate were hanging and got the key and came in .
she then told me it was very rude that i locked the door because ""its my roommates room""

i calmly said if u r going to make me get up and close the door, u can go through the process of unlocking it. my bf also asked why they were acting so passive aggressive for no reason .

0,"AITA for cutting off contact with my mother after she kicked me out for something HER dogs did? |  This started I was 24f. I moved in with my mom and stepfather to job hunt in their city. Found a decent job, but asked to stay with them longer to up my savings because CO is expensive. They were fine with it.

During this time I helped get their dog business going in exchange for paying less rent. I also taught a weekly writing workshop, for free, at the HS where my SF worked. Helped clean the house too.

I went to the mountains for the weekend and developed a head cold while there. I knew the elevation changes on the drive home would make it worse, but didn’t have a choice. Got home around midday while everyone was at work only to find that their dogs had DESTROYED the kitchen. They had ripped doors off the cabinets, dragged trash everywhere, pulled dishes out of the sink, pulled stuff off the counter. They'd messed up the kitchen many times before, but never to this level. Because of the layout of the kitchen it was easy to keep them out of it by putting up a babygate but my mother and SF never put it up.

When I saw what the dogs had done I kicked them out of the kitchen, put up the gate, scrapped up the worst of the trash, and texted my mom ""The dogs tore up the kitchen. Put up the gate so they can't get back in and cleaned the worst of the trash, but I'm sick and feel like crap. Need to go lay down. Sorry I can't get the rest of it.""

5 minutes later I got a text from my SF that I was irresponsible and disrespectful and they were tired of me not contributing to the household. He said they were kicking me out and I needed to be out by Christmas Eve, about 1.5 months away. Normally my SF and I got along well, but we’d had some spats before. I've also had issues with my mother over the years.

When I received the text I decided I was done with them. It was the final straw for me. It was their dogs that had caused the problem, and their unwillingness to use an easy solution for a known problem (putting up the gate to prevent the dogs getting in the kitchen). I was sick and did what I could. Not to mention all the things I had done to help them launch their business (which, 2 years on, is a major part of their retirement plans) and teaching at SF’s school.

I got a new place to live within 24 hours and was out within 3 weeks. I have not spoken to my mom since then, and blocked her on all SM and on my phone. It has done wonders for my stress levels and depression. Then, on my 26th b-day a few days ago, I got an e-mail from her saying she was planning on sending me an Amazon GC and how she'd ""always love me despite everything."" I responded with ""I do not want a GC. I have made it clear that I do not wish to have contact with you anymore."" Her response was to go off about how much I’m wasting my potential and should get over myself and grow up.

So: I was kicked out for something my mother's dogs did, it was the last straw after many other issues over the years, I cut off contact completely, and now my mother is throwing a fit about it. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA For Complaining About A TA Wearing Revealing Clothing? | I had an exam yesterday afternoon, class of about 50 people. A TA was there handing out the exams and invigilating and she looked like she was about to hit the club up after, now she's really hot and slimthick. But I just don't think it was appropriate to wear to work, especially in this scenario where it was distracting. Her tits were out and when she came around to sign people in everyone was staring and it was distracting because she'd walk around and everyone would look. Even the girls were looking as she walked by, so it wasn't only me.

After the exam I spoke to my prof about this and complained and he said he can't do anything about that. My friend said I'm an ass for getting distracted by her and complaining.

1,"AITA for talking to a volunteer about her inappropriate attire? | I work at a local cat shelter that is no kill, and runs primarily on volunteers and donations. Which means it runs well because it is very popular in the community. There are about five paid employees, myself included, spread throughout the week and over twenty volunteers.

I am our equivalent of a shift leader because I am the only paid employee. The others are two volunteers, a brother and sister who have been working since they were fourteen and twelve respectively. Now B is 21 and S is 19. While we work, cleaning boxes/feeding cats/washing dishes, people from the community can come in to play with cats. This week, a man who regularly comes to socialize feral cats told me that S was dressed inappropriately and shouldn't be working on a shift when kids could see her. I told him I'd look into it, and found S cleaning a litterbox.

Sure enough, most of her crack was showing. I should mention here that S is a very heavy girl, and she probably didn't intend to be dressed inappropriately. If I had to guess I would say she didn't know how it was going to fit until she wore it here. In fact, when she stood up she pulled up her pants. They just didn't fit and kept slipping down. I pulled her aside and calmly told her that her pants were not fitting well and made her look inappropriate. I told her since there were people around we needed to fix it, and offered to let her take the rest of her shift off. Instead she called her father and had him bring a hoodie, which she tied around her waist, and finished working.

Today my boss came to me and said she'd heard what I did to to S, and told me I have no right to berate volunteers-I did not berate her. My boss didn't listen, and said that people like S and her family keep our shelter afloat and I should be ashamed for bullying a younger girl on her size. I am in my forties. She gave me an official warning (our shelter works on a marks system, if you get too many you get fired).

Also, I did manage to get my boss to relay what she had been told and to me it doesn't sound like she has an exaggerated version. I don't know why she's blowing it up so much, though.

Some context, this is not focusing on my relationship, this is on my thoughts. 
I did not know about these issues before getting into the relationship.

I’ve been dating my SO for three years now, and for about two of them, we rarely get to go on a date anywhere. I love getting to go to their house and cuddle and watch a movie, but it’s every time nearly. We occasionally see a movie in theaters but about two-three times a year. They have pretty bad social anxiety, any time we go somewhere they’re vomiting and breaking down, even if it’s a simple trip to a local store. I never say what I think, I’m also as supportive as I can be. But in the back of my mind I’m sometimes a little disappointed and irritated that we can’t do anything new. I try to not suggest we can anywhere because of this, but sometimes when I want to go somewhere she would otherwise enjoy, I invite her. Very rarely it pans out, but once a one day beach trip did so. But this time I had somewhere I was very excited to go because she was getting to come with me. She reassured me she could go. Then that morning came, I woke up around 4 am, got ready and started driving to her house, and halfway through she canceled. I turned around, went home, and just sat there. I was very disappointed. She was belittling herself and I was getting her to stop, I reassured her I didn’t hate her, etc. She calmed down and felt better. But I feel horrible.

0,"AITA for asking my mom not to refer to my dad’s girlfriend as “baby mama”? | Throwaway because I’ve said some identifying stuff on my main account.

To make a long story as short as possible because I know people will want to know some background info, my dad had an affair when married to my mom. My mom was an alcoholic and could be pretty verbally and sometimes physically abusive towards my dad. Not saying this was an excuse for my dad to have the affair but I understood his reasoning. It was a messy spilt. 

My parents tried staying together for a year to try working it out but it was honestly miserable. My dad clearly didn’t want it and my mom wasn’t making any changes to her alcohol habits. My mom found out my dad was continuing the affair. 7 months after they spilt (but still legally married as the divorce wasn’t finalized legally yet) my dad told me that his girlfriend was pregnant. My mom found out and as expected she didn’t handle it too well.

Over 5 years later, I have a half-brother I adore. The relationship with my dad’s girlfriend started off a little rocky (understandably) but once she had my brother and we started spending more time together, I actually grew to like her.

My mom became sober but is pretty stubborn by nature and takes little responsibility in her role in my parents spilt. She’s become civil with my dad but still despises my dads girlfriend. I understand and she’s entitled to feel that way. But the issue is she’ll bad talk my dad’s girlfriend in front of me. My mom won’t even say her name and often refers to her as “baby mama”. 

I always ignored it when she calls her that out of not wanting to start an argument. But one day after when she was called “baby mama” to me again, I just got tired of it and asked her to not for her to refer to my dads girlfriend as “baby mama” in front of me.

My mom was MAD. She said that “I was sticking up for her” after what she did to my mom. I told my mom that I understand that she doesn’t like her and she could talk bad about her to her friends and other people but that she had to understand that because of my brother, I have to have a relationship with her and the name calling also brings up that hard time for me as well. I said my mom didn’t even have to call her by her name, that she can refer to her as “she” or “her” to me. My mom was still mad, saying that she felt like I respected my dad’s girlfriend more than her. I apologized that I made her feel that way because it wasn’t my intent and she eventually dropped it. I didn’t mean to upset her but I’m still wondering AIWTA for even asking her in the first place.",False,False

Since then, I couldn't help but notice quite the number of people not only looking at me surprised, but also more or less angry. T

To give an idea of its power, when a car is passing near me I can barely hear it going on, sometimes I can't even hear it if there's a tad too much wind. On the other side, people have noticed me ranging from a good dozen meters to just a few ones.

I get that my music can bother people, but I believe that they can endure it for ten seconds (literally).

To answer the question of the headphone, I found out that my hearing declined quite a bit over the years and I've been told that I was almost shouting when I thought I was talking normally. Thus a few weeks ago I decided to take a first step.

1,"AITA if I ask my roommate to stop throwing up in the bathroom? | This affects me and two other roommates, so I guess it's all of us that's potential assholes.

I'm 19F sharing an apartment with 3 other girls (20-24).

We're pretty sure that one of the roommates, I'll call her Kate because why not, has some sort of a disordered eating issue. She blames her problems with food on poor digestion but we know she binge eats, although she tries to hide her stashes, and the frequent throwing up just screams bulimia to me.

Kate often eats and throws up really late at night, when we're all sleeping or at least trying to sleep. It's pretty loud and honestly gross, and the vomiting-toilet flushing can last for up to an hour.

Don't even get me started on the smell the next morning, even though she does clean up and open the windows. Vomit is just a stench that lingers.

Trust me, we'd all like for Kate to get help, but she's an adult and you can't force someone to talk or change their behavior if they don't want to.

She does this stuff couple of times per week usually, otherwise she's a quiet person who doesn't give anyone trouble - she pays bills on time, does her chores etc. None of us wants to throw her out, but we want her to take her ""business"" elsewhere because it's interfering with all of our lives.

If she won't stop, she could at the very least throw up in her room which is further away from other bedrooms and the stench would stay there.

Just kind of nibbling at first, but at my worst I would bite small pieces off my arm (always the same spot). Today, almost 10 years later, it's hardly visible anymore, but if you look closely you see a faint scar. You still feel it though when you touch it, it's rougher than the surrounding skin. 

When my gf noticed, she asked in a very pushy way until I told her where it was from. Since then, she has been suggesting I look at scar removal and also acted more distant. Just recently, my best friend (who happens to be the bf of my gf's best friend) came and told me that my gf told his gf about my scar and that she was weirded out by how I ""cannibalized"" myself.  

That's okay, she has the right to be weirded out, even if it hurts, but that she went and told someone about what it was from made me furious. I went home to ask her what exactly she said. Turns out I was lucky enough that she left out the backstory, but goddamn, I told her it was personal (my best friend knows about the scar, but not how I got it).

* He cooks with my all-clad skillets with the heat up high for fifteen minutes, and then “washes” them by bringing them over to the sink and dousing them with cold water. He says he “likes the sizzle.” At least one of the skillets is warping a bit, it won’t sit straight on the stove anymore and doesn’t cook evenly.
* He uses my chef’s knife to scrape crud off the counter. I told him to use my razor blade scraper to do it, he said “well, that would be overkill.”
* I have a small toaster oven that acts as a mini-oven, I absolutely love. He butters toast BEFORE putting it in the oven. The fat drips onto the element. He did this so much that I’ve already had to have the element replaced once. He continues to do it and says “we can just replace it again.”
* He cooked a tomato sauce in my seasoned cast iron skillet and then ran it through the dishwasher.
* He leaves lemon juice, tomato, vinegar spills all over the granite countertops. When I tell him to clean up immediately, he laughs and says, “it’s granite, it’s indestructible!”

This all annoyed me so much. I’m annoyed just typing it. Finally I told him that unless he starts actually respecting my equipment, I’m going to put it all under lock and key. He said, “what, you’re banishing me from the kitchen?

I decided to invest my money in a friend’s start up. When my siblings asked what I was doing with my money, I said “investing it.” And they said, basically,  “oh so you think you’re going to make it into more money.” And I said that was the plan. 

They asked if I’d invest some of their money too. I said sure. They didn’t ask what I was investing in. They both gave me about a third of their money. I invested it in the start up. 

The start up didn’t get a patent that they needed and things spiraled and we lost the money. Now my siblings are irate saying I should’ve told them upfront that it was a friend’s business and not the stock market. 

I said if they’d asked I would’ve gladly explained and I was sorry they lost their money but they had to know that was always a possibility when investing. 

They say they feel misled and want me to repay them their lost money, I told them I didn’t ask them to invest or even bring it up, they wanted me to invest it.

Yesterday, I had dinner with just Charley. We had a good time catching up. We didn’t talk much about his girlfriend until he noticed my phone wallpaper as we were waiting for the check. I wrote down a reminder to change that before meeting up with Charley yesterday, but I forgot about it. He asked me why I had that photo as my wallpaper. I was a little embarrassed and hesitated to speak for a few seconds. I just told Charley what I have already told him before, that I was a fan of her before they even started dating, but I respect their relationship and he doesn’t have anything to worry about. Charley never ridiculed me for not being good with women, but yesterday he told me that of course he doesn’t have to worry about me because a guy like me would never get a girl like her. I was really hurt by his words. I told Charley that he might be tall, good-looking, and make a lot of money, but he’s a huge dickhead for saying that. He said he’d rather be the world’s biggest dickhead than be me. I was speechless. He started playing on his phone. Our bill arrived and it came to $63. I put down $40 and walked out.

0,"AITA for not hiring someone based on how they treated me in high school? | A little bit of background. I am the sous chef of a small farm to table restaurant about 30 miles from where I grew up. The executive chef an I have a system for reviewing applicants; I conduct the first interview, and if I think they have potential, I set up a second interview with the executive. We have worked together for years and he trusts my judgement.

Last week, I had an interview with a name I immediately recognized, lets call him Jake. Jake was in my high school graduating class, and for the good part of junior and senior year he made my life hell. Now I wasn't particularly popular in high school, but I was never bullied, except by this guy. His favorite thing to do would be to loudly insult me in front of his friends, then force me to leave because I wasn't cool enough to be around his cool friends. This happened at lunch, gym, assemblies, and sporting  events. I distinctively remember one football game where he kept telling everyone how much weight I had gained recently, calling me a fat fuck and making me sit in the bleachers on the other side of the field. I still think about that stuff today to be honest.

Fast forward 10 years later, and he is sitting in front of me interviewing for a job. I decide to not bring this up, and he never mentions any of it. His interview actually went really well, and he had a pretty good resume. But before we even start talking, I know I am not going to hire this guy.  I finish the interview, tell him I will be in touch, and he leaves. I later call him and tell him we accepted someone else for the position. 

As i was driving home I started to feel a little guilty. This guy was definitely qualified, and we don't see too many applicants being in a small town. High school was 10 years ago, I know I was a different person then, and maybe Jake has changed for the better. 

Am I wrong to judge someone for their actions so long ago? I definitely feel like a bit of an asshole, but honestly if I had to work with him again it would bring up a lot of memories I try not to think about anymore.",False,False

Getting off the bus, there was a girl in her way with earphones in. After walking past/around her, she made a point of saying 'thanks for moving' and scowling at her.

We were chatting with a girl working in a restaurant, it was a bank holiday weekend. We were talking about the business  of the restaurant and she said 'Yes, for those in the hospitality industry this would be one of the busiest times'. Maybe this is me being too sensitive but I just felt the way she phrased this could make the worker think she was uppity or something?..

1,"AITA for telling a girl she looks better with makeup on? | Anger-inducing bait title: Achieved. Here we go:

So I'm a guy who usually keeps my head shaved/buzzed or bald as often as possible, mainly because of my hairline. The part that grows though does grow fast.

At work though I usually wear a hat mainly because (in addition to the above reasons and wanting to look good) I work outside and I sunburn easily. Occasionally (And rarely) after I shave/buzz I'll work without it and wear sunblock instead.

So there's this girl at work (I'll call her Dani) I've known for maybe a couple years. I don't think she's on the spectrum or anything, but I feel like she may not be all-there in social situations, definitely heard her say some things that were weird or off. Also I barely know this girl, I've maybe had a few extensive conversations with her, but never hung out outside of work or anything.

So today was one of those days I just recently shaved and decide not to wear my hat and let it all hang out. Dani is there, she immediately sees me, doesn't miss a beat and blurts out, with a smiley/cheery tone ""**Hey! Wow what happened to your hat? Aww, you look better with your hat on!**""

Of course I'm kinda shocked and taken aback by this comment, I don't need to explain why. Dani, however, was confused and didn't seem to understand why that's such a weird thing to say. She supposedly meant it as a 'complement'. So to that, I responded with - wait for it - saying she looks better with makeup on. I mean, I figured it was an appropriate analogy, basically telling someone ""you look better when you mask one of your natural features"". And yes, I'm well-aware how it would make most girls feel.

She actually didn't seem bothered by that comment, but other people who heard me kinda did. Honestly I don't actually think that, but I wanted to make a point of how it feels to be told that.

She then actually responded with something even weirder - basically telling me that ""she's reached the point where nothing from me would affect her personally"" because of how long we've worked together. That was kinda surprising since I see her on the average of maybe twice a month and never hung out with her. She then went on to say something about ""don't you have those friends that are close and you can say whatever to... like tell them if they have a booger or if their fly is down"".

Again, kinda weird that she sees me as that since I barely know her but whatever. I don't agree with the examples she mentioned being analogous to what she said though. I mean maybe if an actual close friend said that to me it wouldn't be as weird, but would still be kinda weird.

T-6 months to milestone birthday destination celebration, create a plan and invite friends/ family

0,"WIBTA if I had my frozen sperm destroyed? | So I (28m) have been having a lot of discussions/fights with my girlfriend (29f) lately. I will have to give you some background information for this to make sense.

Roughly 2 years ago I was diagnosed with brain cancer. They also found metastasis from the tumor all the way down my spine. I went through chemotherapy and radiation as a result. One possible side effect of the treatment was that I would become infertile. So I had my sperm frozen before the treatment just to be on the safe side and I really did become infertile. 

The problem is that I don't want to have biological children. I also suffer from major depression and my early 20s were absolutely awful as a result. It took me several years just to become a functioning member of society and I still go to therapy and take antidepressants to this day. There's also a history of depression in my family. My mom and my uncle have also been diagnosed with depression and they think that my grandmother also suffered from it.

Because of that I decided that I don't want to have biological children. I just don't want to see my children go through the same problem as I did. I know that wouldn't necessarily happen, but I don't want to take any chances. A large part of my life has been absolutely awful because of depression to the point where I was seriously thinking about taking my own lifefor many years.

Recently my girlfriend and I have been talking a lot about having children. I absolutely love her and definitely want to marry her and start a family with her, but I don't want to have biological children. I would be okay with either a sperm donor or adoption. She doesn't want either of these options though and definitely wants me to be the biological father of her children.

She says that just because depression has been a problem in my family that that doesn't mean my children will suffer from it, too. And while that is true I still don't want to take a chance. The thing is she never knew me when I my depression was really bad. We've known each other for three years and have been together for two years now.

A few days ago I mentioned that I'm thinking about getting rid of my frozen sperm. She immediately started crying and begged me to keep it. I 100% made up my mind on this topic though. I'm not going to have biological children with anyone. I think it's irresponsible and I couldn't live with myself if my children had to go through the same struggles as I did. I just don't see any reason why I should keep my sperm. It costs me ~300€ a year to keep it frozen. (It's frozen at - 196° C.) We're not struggling financially, but I've made up my mind on this topic and see no reason to keep it anymore.

So, WIBTA if I got rid of my frozen sperm and make it impossible for me to have biological children?",False,False
1,"AITA for gifting my partner nice things? | Every occasion, my wife and I get into some sort of fight that involves her getting mad at me for being nice and giving her presents or a planned out fun day. What's suppose to be a celebratory day turns into a fightfest with both of us in separate rooms crying or upset.

&#x200B;

Last year, I gifted my wife expensive tickets to a show I thought she might enjoy. She got upset that I spent hundreds of dollars on a concert for an artist that she never once expressed in. She claimed that I got the tickets because I wanted to see the concert. I honestly thought it would be a cool experience for the both of us to see this iconic band.

&#x200B;

This year, I wanted to surprise my wife for V-day with something nice. I rented a nice ass car for the day to take her out, bought her flowers/candy, wrote her 5 nice cards, took her to lunch, movie, store, and had an evening activity planned as well. While she was ok at first, she started to get cranky 5 hours into the day because she didn't have a chance to get coffee because I was taking her around from 1 place to another. (I will say that my wife is extremely religious about her coffee. She knows what she likes and doesn't like when it comes to coffee and needs ONE cup every day). To be fair, I did have a lot of stuff planned today. She was also stressed because she had a job interview (she is currently unemployed) and I went with her to the interview in the fancy car so that we could start the planned day of activities right after. Just today, here is what she complained about:

&#x200B;

not having coffee all day when i know that's the only thing she needs every day (she doesn't care about food as much as she cares about getting her one cup of coffee)

me spending $ on a fancy car (when she doesn't care for fancy cars and because we only rode in it fror about 20 minutes each way and the car was parked all day in the city)

me taking her to my favorite weed store as part of the surprise and having to wait 30 minutes for the guy to show up to the store (if i had told her what we were doing, she would have gotten coffee in that time but i kept it a surprise)

me giving her nice or fancy gifts when she doesn't want or care for them

me making her walk in the cold when she had thin dress pants on for the interview and not allowing her any time to change. . .

me getting upset when she doesn't show appreciation for my efforts

me not taking medication for my depression

me not going to sleep on time (reason for my tiredness)

&#x200B;

I don't get it. I try and she's not happy. Every time I surprise her with nice things or notes, she questions it.  

Anyways, we got into an argument and she told me she's tired of me being depressed on every other day and then being all perky for an occasion. It seems fake to her. I told her that she's a sad person too. She took that to heart and called me a defensive asshole and left my car to walk the rest of her way home.

On the other hand, they never get that excited about their mother (my wife) but they never seemed to not be happy to see her. They are just more reserved with her. When I come home from work, me and the boys cook together and we have fun doing it. I help them with homework. They feel more comfortable with me when dealing with hard homework because while my wife is not a yeller, she easily gets frustrated. When I help with homework and they make mistakes, I expresses my disappointment as well but not in a rude tone like my wife does. Other then the homework issue, overall me and the boys love spending time together. I have rules like all parents should have but I have fun with them. After work, we would disappear to the office at home where I have a couch, a PC and a computer  and play video games, watch really funny movies  and do other activities and the time would fly very fast but not to the point I would forget their bed time. And on Saturdays I drop them off at sisters house so they could spend time with her kids (their cousins) and I go out with friends and on Sundays me and the boys do outdoor activities like play football or hang out at the pool. My wife is very jealous about this. She makes comments like: why don't you give the kids their space??? Leave them alone !! I was very close to my parents but they were not clingy !! She gets on my nerve and I would respond with rude comments and I know it doesn't help but I can't help it.  She is irrational, immature, annoying and she gets on my nerve. The boys who are only 8 and 7 years old are much more mature then her and for this reason I'm ashamed of her.  She said that I’m clingy and need to give the boys their space but they love the hell out of me and I think she is jealous and I even called her out on it and as a responded by saying that my sons are not my friends and stop treating them as such and I responded by telling her that I’m sorry you grew up without loving parents like I did and I’m sorry you feel the way you feel and you jealous cause I had a better childhood then. This caused an argument. She said that I don’t care about her and I’m teaching the boys to hate her but that’s dramatic. The boys always show her love. Just not in the same way they show it to me and im definitely not teaching them to hate her. I talked to my friends about it and they all agree that my wife is jealous and a drama queen.

0,"AITA for refusing to apologize for telling my aunt to shut up about the year I forgot Mother's Day? | So bit of backstory here; my forgetting Mother's Day happened six years ago. I'm 22(f) now and was 16 when this happened. At the time, I was having a complete mental/psychotic breakdown caused by a medication I was taking. In all honesty, I don't remember much of what happened for most of that year and the year prior.  I'm doing great now, and my mom has long since forgiven me as, in her own words, she's just happy I'm alive and well. 

My aunt, however, doesn't seem to be able to let it go. 

We don't see my aunt all that often, maybe once or twice a year, but she brings up the Mother's Day thing every single time. My mom shuts it down any time she hears it, but unfortunately she doesn't hear her every time. I normally bite my tongue to keep the peace (a difficult thing, seeing as I wasn't exactly raised to keep my mouth shut), however, when she was at our house last weekend I kind of lost it on her when she made one of her usual comments. 

I flat out told her to shut up. I told her she had no idea what that year was like for me, or what it was like for my parents when they learned what I was going through. I told her that I even forgot my own birthday that year, because I didn't even know what day it was most of the time. Basically, I let out years of frustration that had built up with her snide comments. When I was done, I stormed off before I said something really nasty and stayed in my room until she left. 

The reason I'm asking if I'm TA is because, in the week since, I've had several people (mostly other family members) tell me I was out of line. My aunt's son (23), even called me to tell me to apologize, saying that she was only joking when she brought up Mother's Day and that she didn't know the extent of what I went through. Hearing this, I now feel extremely guilty about the way I reacted, but I still refuse to apologize unless she does so first. The way I see it, my mom shut her down repeatedly over the years, so she should have stopped mentioning it. I'm also beginning to feel like a dick for telling her to shut up.

If I’m being honest, I’ve got some trauma due to being raised in the religion, and have a slight dislike/disdain for it, but I don’t bash others for believing. You do you boo boo, idc. My mil also knows I’m not religious, neither is her son (my husband), and nor will we be raising our daughter religiously. We’re of the mindset that once she’s old enough to understand and want to learn about a religion of her choosing, we’ll support her in that endeavor, whatever the religion may be. Having said that, it’s recently come to my attention that when we’d drop DD(9mo) off with MIL, she’s been taking her to church. Honestly, I wasn’t a fan of it, but I figured she’s young, so it’s not like she understands anything/is having anything imposed on her, so whatever, I guess. Plus I understand my MIL truly loves her religion and her grand daughter, so I’m not going to make a fuss and make her have to choose between her god and her grandchild. But *then* I found out my MIL has been buying and reading her religious children’s material, like a my first bible, having her watch Veggie Tales, buying her clothes that say “god loves me” etc. I also found out that she’d been taking away the $1 bills her uncles would give her, and give them to her church in tithing envelopes with DDs name on it, and have her drop it in the bucket. I do NOT like this, and want to tell her so. She knows our plans as far as our daughters upbringing and our own values and something about the situation just feels gross to me. My husband, on the other hand, thinks it’s nbd and I should leave it alone, bc it’s just her trying to bond with her and it’s not like DD knows what’s going on or is old enough to have anything ingrained in her.

0,"AITA for continuously reporting my colleagues mistakes, resulting in one coworker being so stressed she had to take a leave of absence? | I'm going to try and keep this kind of fuzzy for anonimities sake. I'm a nurse who works in a community setting - I see 10+ patients in a day, some for woundcare, some palliative (symptom management for those with progressive illnesses through end of life until death), and anything inbetween. I have 6 colleagues that I work with in a day and we each have our own area that we cover. 




The backbone of nursing is good documentation. Without it you're at risk of losing your license. It's drilled into our heads since day 1 in school, and is a very basic component and expectation of our job. 3 nurses I work with are negligent in their assessments and charting. They don't complete weekly wound measurements (the gold standard to ensure no deterioration occurs), they aren't ordering supplies for their patients, and they aren't completing thorough assessments. 



At the start I gave them gentle reminders about best practice, and offered constructive criticism on how they could improve. This didn't work, so I gave feedback to management (omitting names) on what I'm noticing so it could be discussed at our meetings. After numerous reminders and emails sent out over the span of months (by management) with no improvement I sat down frustrated, as their negligence resulted in more work for me and adverse effects for patients (as specific as I'd like to be.. But there were a few serious incidents where patients became upset to the point of tears as a result). 




After months of leeway I've started reporting any errors I catch directly to management including the name of the nurse. They finally listened, and sent out an email saying continued negligence will result in nurses being reprimanded up to and including termination + mandatory reporting to the nurse regulatory body in our province. This week I caught a TON of errors from one nurse in specific. Some smaller stuff: No wound measurements, not fully completing an admission chart, not ordering supplies on specified order days. Some bigger stuff, too: no vitals taken or a thorough pain assessment done (on a complex palliative patient.. There is no excuse for this), not answering patient page outs, etc. 




This eventually lead to this nurse having her first written warning in her employee file. I overheard her crying today, saying she's going to take a stress leave. I feel like I'm the cause. Yes, she continuously didn't complete basic tasks of her job, however I feel like a tattletale.

1,"AITA for asking my friend to not buy the same skis as me? | Throwaway account so uh yeah.

So, two years back I (17F) moved to a new school. I didn't really make a lot of friends for a while, but I got into a lot of the clubs while trying to. I joined the ski club and really liked it, so over the next summer I saved up to get my own skis. I finally did, which is great. 

A few of my friends joined ski club this past year with me. One of our other friends didn't, but now with us all staying home he's heard a lot about it, since we didn't get to go on the spring trips we were all looking forward to. And he wants to buy skis and join us next year since it'll be our senior year and we want to make up for this year.

Except he wants the same skis that I have. He's heard me talk about them before, and asked me if I would be all right if he got the same ones I have (they're not 'girl skis' or whatever, and we're about the same height). I said I'd prefer if he didn't. I really, really like my skis, and I like having ones that aren't the same as other people. All my other friends rent skis or use their parents or whatever. But, in the end, I said if he did get them I'd be annoyed but I'd get over it.

Except now he's telling all my friends that I ""won't let him get the same skis"" and that I'm being petty and dumb for getting annoyed. But I think it's fair that I said I'd be annoyed, because I do like having something that's just 'mine'. But it's not like they're special-edition or anything, so of course other people will have the same ones as me. I'm not saying I'll stop being friends with him or anything if he gets the same skis, I'll just be a bit annoyed and then I'll get over it! I even told him a few weeks ago that if he wants the same ones so much he should get them, and I'll deal. It's gotten out of hand with all our friends siding with one person or the other and I'm kind of worried he'll stop wanting to be my friend because of this.

My SIL hit me up for spa passes, and when I told her I would need a manager’s clearance for the kids to wait in the kid area, because it’s not safe for them to be in the steam/hot tub/ sauna area, she copped a derogatory attitude with me, for being “just” a lifeguard. I did it all, I gave her a full spa pack, on my tab, plus full access ( she still complained that it was only for one). While she was relaxing, I gave her kids gifts: 2 lbs of pixie stixx and a pound of chocolate cream bon bons. I bought one kid a Bop it, and the other a Simon Air, but didn’t give them the wrapped games until five minutes before they left. I may have also given them some blow pops, since someone as poor as myself could never possibly understand marrying someone for a new Benz, and the importance of owning such a vehicle. Personally, neither her brother (my spouse) nor myself would ever spend that much on a fancy-trimmed sedan, while raising a six year and an eight year old, without investing in seat covers. Her kids love me, and I regret buckling them in with apple juice instead of Gatorade or Hugs or...do they even still make grape Squeeze-its? Did I go too far? She pulls snide comments and remarks like this, because she’s never really struggled or worked for a living. She didn’t even have to take out college loans. Her father paid for everything. I work, and take classes when I can. I may not have come far, but I am mostly debt-free, and not a burden to anyone. I have pointed this out to her before, and she still uses it to tear at me.

This sibling borrows my car (which I paid for) and leaves it without refuelling and leaves it in a mess every time. Dirty tissues, rubbish and it always smells of fucking perfume after. My girlfriend got a little worried because of that!

Anyway, she borrowed my laptop case ages ago, saying she'd give it back that day. She didn't. I asked her for it and she literally said ""Bye!!"" and got in a taxi to the train station and went back to uni. 

Today, with all the family about, I simply said, ""Hey, can I have that back now please?"" pointing at the case. Holy shit. She started screaming at me saying I'm selfish and blah blah blah. She said ""You've got loads of money, buy it yourself!"" to which I responded, ""I did. It's mine... That's why it fits my laptop perfectly but is loose to yours..."". 

Then my mum started on me saying I should share. How the fuck am I supposed to share a laptop case when we live cities apart?

I just want my stuff back. I don't complain about the mess she leaves my car in. The one time I asked for my phone charger back, she flipped out and cried to my parents (I got it back and refused to apologise).

0,"WIBTA if I refused to speak at a memorial for my brother? | My older brother and I were 13 years apart, but he died suddenly when I was 4 - he was 17. Obviously, my parents took it really hard and they were scared I would too. At the time, I don't think I knew what was happening at all, but my parents made it a priority to have me in grief counseling, which I did up until a year after he passed. To this day, I have absolutely no memory of him. I don't know his voice, face, etc. except for what I've seen in photos or videos.

I don't know if I'm going to explain this well, but I feel like my parents have always placed more emphasis on our relationship than actually existed/exists? They always talk about how as a little kid, if I was having a fit, I'd just see him and start to calm down, or how we were ""two peas in a pod"" and inseparable, how my older brother was so excited to have a little brother to teach and how they see so mcuh of him in me or whatever. But I don't remember any of that. When people ask me if I have siblings I say no, because I don't and it feels like I never did. I have no connection to him, I just don't feel anything towards him. He sounds like a great guy but I don't know that.

Anyways, my parents are hosting their annual memorial for his birthday, and they want me to speak. Before, they thought I was too young but apparently 16 is the perfect age to talk about your dead brother. I hate talking about him or the memorial with my parents because they get really sad and nostalgic and it makes me feel uncomfortable because they start up with the ""you look so much like him"" and I just feel suffocated. My friends are torn - half think it'd be rude if I didn't just make up something generic and go, the other half think I should just skip the memorial altogether if it makes me feel weird. I feel like any adult in my life will automatically tell me to speak because it's the right thing to do for my parents, but I don't want to. It would all be generic lies or parroting stories my parents have told me a million times.

The comedian is apparently somewhat famous but I've ever heard of him. Anyways he kicked off the show talking his friends Aziz Ansari and Louis CK. I was like whoa...bold move and I was seriously taken aback and pretty defensive.


 He told more jokes and I didn't laugh once. He then said somthing about ""#movement (auto mod didn't like this term ) has run its course!"" I couldn't help myself so I yelled out somthing like ""that subject is never funny."" He stopped in his tracks and called for the door  men to walk me out and that he wasn't messing around because he was sick or something.

The manager met me outside and said that I was kicked out but he's comp our drinks which made me feel good until he started chewing me out like a little kid that stand up is an ""art"" and it's the ""height of asshole"" to heckle a set. He said I was on a two week ban. Really...ok.

1,"AITA to tell her not to bench press my friggin boyfriend? | I have been with my bf John for a little over half a year now. Things are great he is a real catch.

The only thing that I've had to adjust to is that his two closest friends of all time are two drop dead gorgeous women. And he lives with one of them. Of course that is just one of my many insecurities so whatever.

The girl that he lives with is really athletic. She is a karate instructor so of course. I follow her on Instagram and yesterday she posted on one of her stories the following:

A video of her basically bench pressing my boyfriend with the caption ""if gyms are closed we have to make do girls"" and then a little text below that read ""90kg achieved. Next goal 100"".

This actually pissed me off. I understand that she wants to keep fit but heck. That is my boyfriend and I find it really inappropriate to do that kind of thing. So I responded to her story if that was really necessary. This is a copy paste of our exchange :


Me: Was this really necessary?


Her :?


Me :??


Her : Can you explain?


Me : Why bench press (John)


Her :.... Why not?


Me :. Idk dude it's kinda shady.


Her :Is it tho?


Me : Yes.


Her : I am still confused?


Me: Look dude I get it. You are a gym freak I see it. But (John) has a girlfriend and this is just really stepping over boundaries. There are simply certain things you don't do out of respect for another party. Simple as that. I don't say anything when you hug or stuff because that is something that I had to compromise on regarding my personal beliefs. But this is, again, stepping over the line to inappropriate territory. I don't mean to come off as mean or anything. I hope you can read out of my text that I don't mean to Attack you or be rude! I would just appreciate it if you simply would think about me on the future regarding such things involving (John)


Her : (my name) take that up with John seriously. He didn't seem to have a problem with that.

Then she didn't respond again. Her answer peeved me a bit. I expected at least a ""sorry I wasn't really thinking"" or sum. Idk. Later John texted me saying that we have to have a serious talk tonight. Before I go into that talk I have to know if I am the asshole here.",False,False
0,"AITA for not leaving work to pick up my distressed daughter? |  AITA for not leaving work to pick up my distressed daughter?

My  daughter is 15 years old, she went to a party last night that got way  out of hand (too many people, drugs, teenagers being stupid teenagers). I  told her that she wouldn't be allowed to go to this party because my  wife (her mom) is overseas atm and I would be working a night shift so I  wouldn't be able to pick her up or drop her off.   


Being the  rebellious teenager she is, she went anyway (I'm not surprised or angry,  I did the same at her age) but then called me at around 2 AM saying  that she was feeling uncomfortable because her friends were pressuring  her to drink and do drugs and she really didn't want to, so she asked if  I would be able to pick her up.   


I work as a security guard,  and the way the job works is we have 5 people rotating in 5 different  spots. It's a very high security company we work for and it's instant  dismissal for leaving a post unguarded. I called my supervisor and asked  if he would be able to get a replacement in ASAP for me, but because we  were already a guard down and it was 2 AM, there was no one available.

I  called my daughter back and asked if she was drunk, she said no. I  asked her if there was anyone else at the party who was sober, she said  yes. I told her to go up to them and say ""My friends are pressuring me  to drink, but I really don't want to, is it cool if I hang with you  guys?"" and to just stay with them until my shift finished in 3 hours  when I would be able to pick her up. She said she would.

When I  finally picked her up, she refused to talk to me at all until we got  home where all she said was ""I can't believe you wouldn't pick me up  when I asked you too."" She's locked herself in her room and I've not  gotten a very angry phone call from my wife asking what the hell I was  thinking not picking her up immediately. My wife understands the dynamic  at my work, however I get the impression she might think I'm being  dramatic when I say instant dismissal. I'm not, I would have been fired  and between my wife and I, I make 80% of our income.   


I didn't  want to call her an Uber or a taxi because I didn't feel comfortable  with her being in a strangers car at 2 AM. I was worried something might  have happened to her at the party, so I called her best friend who I  know went as well and asked her if anything happened. She assured me  that the two of them were joined at the hip the entire night, and while  my daughter wasn't having a good time, nothing outright bad happened.

0,"AITA for telling students they could leave | This was a while ago, but reading this sub got me wondering about it. 

A few years ago I was attending a community college. I also worked there, work-study, as a tutor. 2 days a week I sat in on the class I tutored for and helped students. 

I want to emphasize here that I was not a teachers assistant. I was told, explicitly, that I was just there to answer student questions during their free-work time, since it was a large class. 

One day I got to the class and the teacher wasn't there. Students come, we all sit and wait... and wait... 35 minutes later (it was a 2 hour class) the teacher still wasn't there. I let the students go and go home myself. About an hour after that I got an email from the teacher, telling me how disappointed he is with me, how irresponsible it was to not keep the class there, and that he had been working with another student in his office and lost track of time, why didn't I come get him?

The next day I met with him to apologize and explain that I had, in fact, looked for him but I didn't know where his office was and the main office was closed because of the time. He basically said whatever, don't let it happen again and we moved on. 

So I kinda feel like it's not my job to hunt down the teacher for his class, and I already kept the students longer than strictly necessary. Was I the asshole, though?

The wedding invite explicitly stated (in a terrible bit of prose) that they expect cash as a gift, as they have ""everything"" else they need.

$100 on the bachelor party
1.5 days of vacation days for me (because the wedding and rehearsal are midweek during 9-5 work hours)
4 hours missed work for my husband

0,"AITA For not being close with my adopted sibling at all? | So I'll try to preface this by saying that I hold no ill will towards her nor am I jealous or something of the like given I often see people jump on those reasons in similar posts and I added adopted because it is relevant to the story. I figured I'd try to get that out of the way. I am not English or American so I am sorry for any mistakes.

Now I am 22M and I have two ""Blood"" siblings who we'll call Jack(24M) and Jane(25F).

Now my parents pretty much suffered from empty nest syndrome when all of us moved out, first my brother when he was 18 to go off to Uni, followed by my sister at 21 to live with her boyfriend in another city and finally I moved out 3 years ago at 19 also to go to Uni, my mom was literally inconsolable for the first month when I moved out and would often make little jabs at all three of us for ditching them when in reality we all just grew up and are in active contact with them.

Now it is very relevant to add that the Uni I go to is pretty mych on the other side of the country resulting in me not being able to visit my parents regularly and I basically only visit them twice a year at most and they visit me a few times a year as well, but it is not often purely because of the distance.

2 years ago my parents informed me they were going to be fostering a girl and apparantly already went ahead with their plans and wanted to surprise us with the great news, my brother was the first to state the obvious that they were both in to their 50's and adopting a toddler was simply not a good idea, I said I was happy for them but stated the same worries, I mean the moment she would be 18 they would nearing 70 and who is to say they'll be in good health at that point?

Well they went ahead with it and about a year of having her they formalized it and adopted her legally

Well, I have seen her a few times these past 2 years, But I have no relationship with her, I am pretty shitty with kids to begin with add to that the fact I rarely see her, it is not exactly a good formula to create a sibling relationship, my brother feels the same as he also lives far from our parents. Only our sister sees her more regularly.

Now with the things going on my parents have been calling far more often and after a while of this my mom seemed aggitated at me, when I asked her why she said she was annoyed that I never ask to speak to my sister so I told her I am not sure what to discuss with a 6 year old.

When I think about it we're just not close, I mean I get my parents love her and want her to get the full sibling experience but  it just doesn't feel the same to me as it does with my brother and sister as we grew up together and all, she is if I am going to be blunt a 6 year old that I see once in a while if that makes sense yet I feel incredibly guilty about it as obviously she can't help it at all, I just feel this entire situation is mostly awkward and I am not sure what to even do, I can't force brotherly feelings to appear out of thin air.

My roommate and I just graduated this winter and we both got jobs in the same cities so we decided to rent a 2 bedroom together. We are both 23 and guys.   We just moved in this week and haven’t had any time to move in any furniture such as couches.  All we really have is our beds, desks, drawers and some chairs for the living room and a table.  I have a double bed in my room while he has a single.  

Tonight his GF (22F) iis coming for the week (Until sunday morning) to visit.   She graduates in the spring.  This is fine and isn’t a problem.

I told him sorry, but no.  He then said she had a huge crush on me and this was every guys dream, he said she told her sister she wanted to share the bed with a older, mature male.  This was really tempting as I don’t really have much experience being intimate with girls.  However I still said no, i said too much could go wrong.  I suggested my roommate buy a air matress for her but he said no.  His GF then called me and said please, it would be so much fun and she would make sure her sister behaved.

0,"AITA for refusing to clean certain things for the past ten years? | I've lived with my family for my entire life but around the time I hit high school I started realizing all my chores were bullshit. The bullshit part about my chores were how much of the mess around the house wasn't mine. Most of my time was spent in my room or at my computer because my family was highly judgmental. I basically got depression and anxieties by living with them. I avoided interacting with them as much as possible. I still do but I consider our relationship way more healthier given my mom, the main source of my stress, passed away. Different story.

&#x200B;

Because of my isolation, I basically never enter most rooms in the house. I also learned to clean after myself because that's what normal people do apparently? So everywhere I went in the house, my typical spots were cleaner. The living room, kitchen, hallways, and laundry room were always a disaster. My mom and my sister left all their belongings around the house despite having rooms. My brother is ironically a clean freak but he and my sister have a tendency to miss the trashcan despite it being right next to all the trash. My brother and sister's rooms are major disasters. Like, they have clothes, trash, and old food everywhere. In terms of cleaning up, they refuse to keep up with cleaning. They don't clean up after themselves or clean a little over a week. They instead wait until I do it or until they need to have someone over so it's gotta be done right fucking now. (I stopped doing dishes and it took them three weeks to do any.)

&#x200B;

Another point is that they kept buying pets. I love all my pets with all my heart but we have never had a normal amount of animals. We currently live in a single-wide manufactured house with 5 animals (7 before we released our turtles). I have agreed to zero of these. They do walk the dogs and take care of their food and boxes better than I do these days but I have let them do most of the work since they like having a permanent zoo. They like to leave all their clean laundry in baskets in the wrong rooms and with improperly trained pets they don't stay clean (read: piss).

&#x200B;

All of this was the main reason for me deciding to move out. I have enough to worry about with a full-time job, depression to stay on top, etc. It's also a burden on my mental health to constantly be living around someone else's mess and five animals. For the past month, I've basically been doing the bare minimum like they do. Have I been an asshole for all this time?",False,False

We recently moved to a larger town (from a small one) as my husband found a better higher paying job. Don’t have any family or friends here. 

My husband got invited to a charity gala for work, which although was optional would not have been a good look if a new employee sat it out. We were not expected to donate any money, but it was a black tie event.

I had nothing to wear to this event, but he was insistent that I needed to come. I tried rental agencies but I’m a larger girl and nothing fit me right.

I went to a plus-size bridal type store and found a dress that fit me properly and looked stunning. I looked at the price tag and had a mini mental breakdown because it was so expensive. I’d been looking for so long and this was the only dress that fit. 

One of the sales assistants (a larger woman herself) took me aside and asked me what was wrong. She was so kind and offered me so much sweetness. She said that her manager would kill her, but she understood my situation and without outrightly stating it told me that the store had a 30 day full refund program. She implied that I could buy the dress and return it. 

I went to the gala and I looked amazing, my husband looked amazing and it was the first good day I’ve had in a while. I tucked the tag into the waist of my skirt, everything was going well until 

one of his coworkers said hello to me and whispered: u/itcarriesonman you left your tag on and she proceeded to pull it off. I felt my heart drop and I felt awful. I didn’t say anything right away, but I was devastated.

I took her aside later in the night and told her that I wasn’t planning on keeping the dress, I needed to return it and that our family was in financial trouble. I asked if she would be willing to pay for the dress. She refused.

So much so that people know me as book kid. I read English books and its finland so people are usually curious. 

So while im reading i constantly get people asking stuff like “what are you reading?” “Why do you read so much” “whats the book about” “where did you get it?” Etc
Usually if im in a good mood i will answer ONE question if they ask again i will give them a death glare, on the third question I’ll tell them to fuck off

If its a kid i will go up to three questions in a good mood. otherwise I’ll death glare them and tell them to fuck off.

So one time i was hanging out with my friend and we were reading together. A kid comes up and asks what im reading, i tell him and he thinks for a bit and asks me what its about. Death glare, he asks again, i tell him to fuck off, the kid looks shocked (he was maybe eight) and walks off. My friend turns to me and goes “what the hell dude he was a kid” i just shrug and go back to reading.

1,"AITA for getting a family thrown out of a restaurant for underage drinking? | Throwaway account.  We were at a local restaurant last Saturday evening. This is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. There was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

But as I watched I noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who I assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. In fact, I'd guess the 4th girl consumed MOST of the mom's margarita. I mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. Full disclosure that I'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. So I mentioned it to the hostess. A short time later a manager (I assume) came and asked to see the girls' ID's. The girl with her own drink produced one. The second girl who had been drinking from Mom's drink did not.  I did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. I assume they were asked to do so. 

My husband said that it was a crappy thing for me to do. I feel like I was protecting the restaurant. Was I the Asshole?",False,False
1,"AITA for telling a friend to cancel her gym membership? | I enjoy going to the gym a lot and have been for quite a few years, rather than pay for a cheap gym that will always be busy I shell out a lot for a place near my work that has a lot of amenities such as a pool, sports massage, spa etc. and it costs me £160 a month. This is very expensive but I'm happy paying it and is gives me everything I want.

A friend and I were recently talking and she explained that she wanted to get in better shape and tone up, I told her what I do but with men and women's bodies and goals being different I told her I can't help that much. She asked what gym I go to and wanted to sign up, so I got her a discount with those ""invite a friend"" things and she started to join me. She got a personal trainer session and he started her off with a body weight exercises and (in my eyes) a useless routine using rubber bands, exercises balls and a ""circuit"" that is just her using her body weight. 

She only ever seems to go when I'm going to the gym and just does the circuit this guy designed for her. I don't know how much she earns but it feels wrong her paying for an expensive gym when he routine can be done at home or a cheap gym. AITA for telling her she should probably quit the gym and just get an exercise ball at home or join a cheaper one?

1,"AITA for getting her disqualified from a contest? | Throwaway due to privacy.

Our local movie theatre does giveaway's often. Basically they'll tell you to ""like"" the post; tag someone you'd take with you and answer a 25 word or less question. Today's post was about amazing people who have helped you through tough times. My (F52) daughter L (F28) tagged her housemate who is literally the laziest person I've ever met. He doesn't help her cook, clean, he doesn't work, he manipulates her to do everything by herself and then tells her ""she didn't have to do that"" because he was 'going to do it' and she has no right to be upset because ""He does things without praise all the time!"". He even refuses constantly to help her carry the groceries from the car up the stairs to her house and L is physically impaired. He's quite simply put - a leech. He can only pay rent from government money and doesn't do much more. L works 40 hours a week and still has to come home and do everything while C tells her ""I'm hungry"".

I didn't see the original comment - I just saw it hours later that ""L commented on (movie theatre's name) post"" in my notification I didn't see that the movie theatre had already commented with a winner at first (they don't reply to the original comment, but simply tag the winners in a new comment at the bottom of the comment list) - and only saw my daughters original comment. So I replied and said ""Are you serious? C is the least helpful person I know. He is lazy, manipulative,  disrespectful, argumentative, doesn't help you do anything - not even bring in the groceries and you're disabled - or pay his way. He is the least deserving person you know to go with you! You could have picked anyone else!"".

L had actually won the competition (not sure how exactly it works) - but after my comment was made, less than 20  minutes later, L called me, crying and yelling saying that the cinema had deleted their comment and redrawn prizes saying that there was a ""mistake"" and the winner was actually (random girl). L thinks I'm an absolute asshole for doing what I did and that I have no idea how much this would have meant to L and C and how dare I hate C for ""no good reason"". I told her I hate C because of all of the above reasons and she told me that she ""never said that"" and that C is an amazing person.  L claims she's also had a couple of messages from friends asking if she's in an unsafe relationship and if she needs to be 'rescued' from C - which was, in L's words ""completely humiliating"".

So AITA? Or is this just a blessing in disguise if other people are now also keeping an eye on L's situation? They wouldn't be offering to 'rescue' her if they thought everything was fine right?

1,"AITA for kicking my employee out of the office? | I am an Office Manager at a tax firm. We had to work today, but very few people showed up (they took vacation). Our boss said we could leave as early as 2PM and all but one person took him up on his offer. His name is Eric and he is an older gay guy. I don't think he has family or any friends and he spoke about breaking up with his boyfriend a couple of years ago. Nice guy, hard worker, quiet yet obviously lonely. I told Eric he should just leave and whatever work he had could wait until Monday (which is 100% true and he's ahead on his work). He declined and made up excuse after excuse as to why he needed to stay.

Sometimes he comes in at 8AM and doesn't leave until 7PM even though his work schedule is 8:30AM to 5:30PM. He doesn't ask for OT. My boss started to grow concern about his working so late because he thinks he's overworked and suggested that I take on some of Eric's work. That's not the case at ALL. He just doesn't have a life outside of work. He's one of those people. I know my boss would find out that he stayed late, AGAIN and on a semi-holiday, and that would result in my having to take on his work. I told Eric that I wasn't trying to be rude and knew he was working, but he had to leave - boss's orders.

1,"AITA for clarifying that an iced coffee is cold? | The family and I stopped at Dunkin Donuts for some morning beverages.  When placing her order my wife asked for an iced latte.  The person taking our order then asked if she wanted that hot or cold.  I interrupted the exchange to say ""an iced latte is cold."" I immediately got the death stare from my wife and I'm sure the employee saw it and I didn't say anything else.  

Afterward my wife yelled at me for being so rude.  I defended my case by saying her job was to take your order.  When someone orders an iced drink it isn't necessary to immediately ask if they want it hot or cold.  So she must not have been paying attention.  I also reminded her that I am a smart ass by nature and I didn't really mean anything by it.  But you could see a downshift in the employees upbeat attitude afterward.

I think I could've diffused the situation at the time but my wife reacted so quickly that I didn't have a chance to follow up with the ""I'm just messing with ya."" And I think she certainly did deserve to be messed with but I wasn't trying to ruin her morning.

1,"AITA for not inviting a groomsman’s fiancée to my bachelorette party? | My fiancé Sam and I are planning a joint bachelor and bachelorette party. How it works is that we both invite who we want (basically who we would be inviting to a traditional party) but it is a joint celebration. There will be a couple of small activities that are girls/guys only but for the most part, all of our friends will be celebrating together. 

One of Sam’s groomsmen, Alex started dating his fiancée Steph about 6 months into our engagement and just over a year later they are already living together and have recently gotten engaged. I think that we have been very accommodating of her in regards to the wedding, making sure to add her to the guest list even though we had already started planning when they got together. We have also changed our seating plan so that they can sit together for the reception. She is a nice person from what I’ve seen and the four of us have hung out a few times but I do not consider her a close friend so she is not on the list of people I chose to invite to my bachelorette party. 

Not long after the invites to the party went out, Alex asked Sam if Steph is able to come with him as it is a joint party. Sam told him that which girls were invited is my call, so they would have to ask me. The next day, Steph reached out to me, asking if she would be able to come with Alex. I told her that I was only inviting close friends so she would not be able to come. My reasoning is that this night is about friendship and I don’t want to make it a couples event. Besides, I don’t think it should be a problem for him to spend a night with just friends.

She seemed hurt by my response and said “Okay, I’m sorry for wanting to be included.” A few days later she messaged me again, apologising for her passive aggressive response and explained to me that the reason she wants to go so badly is because Alex works in a bar while she works a standard 9-5 job and as a result he hardly ever gets a weekend night off and they almost never get to go to parties together. She also said that getting a Saturday off is a big deal for him because it is their busiest night and him taking this day off as well as one for the wedding in a couple of months means he won’t be able to it again for quite a long time, so she really would appreciate the chance to spend it with him.

After hearing that, I do feel a bit bad about my decision but I still would prefer to keep it as a friends only event and I worry her being there would ruin the dynamic. I told her I would think about it and I am wondering if I am being an asshole for excluding her from the party and should just suck it up and invite her.",False,False

I stayed with her and just listened to her talk for the next hour and she started hugging me and cuddling me some more while she cried and i just let her.

0,"Aita for not realising I was someone's best friend? | This is a 15 year old dilemma (sorry if that isn't permitted) but my anxiety still gnaws at this sometimes when things are slow (I'm in the process of getting help for the anxiety) so I'd like to know once and for all how much of an ah i was.

From my pov, when we were about 13 a girl in my extended friend group lived on the road I walked down to get to school. She was Ok but not someone I considered a close friend. Over time it seemed like she was usually ready just as I came by and we would walk down the road together. She would tell me stuff about her life that i assumed was just early morning small talk. I didn't really talk much about myself. We were in the same form (uk equivalent of home room?) But didn't have many other lessons together so we only really spoke on the way to school. After a couple of months of this I saw her quite upset, talking to people i thought she was good friend with so i left them to it figuring it wasn't my business. 

From *her* pov, we bonded during our walks to school, which was a treasured routine and she would wait for me every day, and she told me important secrets. I was her best friend and when she was having a really hard day, I looked at her and walked off. She came to me incredibly upset and told me off for being a bad best friend, i totally failed to deal with confrontation, stammered an apology. she stopped waiting for me in the mornings/i started taking a different route and we went back to acquaintances.

I know this is a pretty mild one but I still sometimes look back and cringe and most of the (few) people I've recalled this story to think i definitely behaved p aholishly.

0,"AITA for not telling my parents we had a baby? | My parents and I have had a relatively rocky relationship, which got much worse after I met the woman who became my wife (long story). There were various incidents of different severity, but it kind of came to a head in 2016. We had been keeping our distance from my parents - particularly my mom - after a tumultuous year.

My mom and I had a rough conversation the day after Thanksgiving in 2016, when I explained why we had been keeping our distance; she responded with vitriol, shouting at me and calling me names (disgusting, evil, horrible, etc.). Two days later, my aunt called to disinvite my wife and me from the family Christmas celebration. It became clear that my parents were trying to punish me, though I wasn't sure why. My aunt would not tell me what I had done wrong.

A year passed, and I did not hear from anyone in my family, except for my mom's brother and my dad's oldest sister; I was all but fully estranged. In that time, my wife and I found out that we were pregnant with our first child. We didn't like the idea of a traditional baby shower, so we decided to have a baby ""party"", and we invited everyone with whom we still had some semblance of a relationship.

We learned that my parents had told anyone invited to the party that they had to choose – my parents or us. They were serious, apparently, because the ones who came to the party have not heard from them since.

Given that my parents hadn't spoken to me in over a year and that they had gone to pretty extraordinary lengths to ostracize my wife and me from my extended family, I had no reason to believe they had interest in my life any longer, so I saw no reason to tell them about the birth of our daughter.

I received an email a couple days after my daughter was born, in which my mom expressed her ""disappointment"" that I hadn't told her. I replied by explaining why, and I told her that our relationship could be salvaged, but a prerequisite was her acknowledging the hurtful things she had done in the previous two years. I also noted that I couldn't guarantee that the relationship could be salvaged, but an honest apology would be a good first step. I didn't hear back from her.

Last year, I received a similar email, and I provided a similar response; this time, my mom told me my grandmother was in a nursing home, but she refused to tell me where. We asked my godmother – mom’s sister – who called us disgusting and cruel for what we had done, though she didn’t tell us what that was.

My best guess here is that my parents find that our decision not to tell them we had a baby was cruel, which leads to my question here. I have been generally confident, but sometimes I really wonder whether I'm missing something and that it's actually my fault...

0,"AITA for kicking someone out over spoilers? | More specifically, that and their attitude after the spoilers occurred.

So this actually happened a few hours ago, and after a period of radio silence between us, I'm left wondering if he or I were the one to overreact. 

Alrighty, so on to the story. The person I'm seeing (32m) and I (27f) enjoy watching shows together. Generally speaking he picks them because he has kind of a different taste than I do (ie, I could watch mad reruns of The Office and be content, but he likes to mix it up, and watching shows with more grit). Now, in principle, I'm generally fine with this because he does show me things I haven't seen before that I do end up enjoying (although I have had to put a foot down once or twice when I'm completely disinterested in a show, and he puts it on anyway... but that's a whole different ball o' wax...).

So today we were watching one of His Shows, that took me a little while to get into, but I'm beginning to be invested in the storyline, so I'm actively watching as well. At the end of the episode, there was a moment off camera with a gunshot, and it was framed like Female Character would die. I reacted like, ""oh no,"" so he says, ""Don't worry, she doesn't die,"" which peeved me, but I felt was said with good intentions. The next episode comes up, Female Character actually shot someone else, and the story moves on.

He followed my sigh of relief with, ""She does die later though.""..... Like wtf dude, ok spoilers much?

So I asked him to give away nothing more because I would like to watch the story unfold. He counters my request by saying, ""Well, Male Character dies, too..."" .... Male Character also hasn't died yet... 

So I asked him to say nothing more about it, or I just don't want to watch this with him right now cuz he was ruining it for me. He complains that, ""You're allowed to make comments but I'm not? Yeah, ok that's fair.""... which would be a fair point if my ""comments"" weren't all related to what's *currently on screen* in *shows he's already seen and I haven't*.

So I got frustrated with the whole ordeal and just quietly switched off the show, did not choose another, and leaned back silently to browse my reddits and breathe. He took this as me being passive aggressive, and started scrolling on his own phone making very loud comments about everything on his feed.

I asked him to stop that as well, and when he chose not to, I asked him to leave. (Funny enough, got a text half an hour later saying he'd cooled off... )

0,"AITA for charging client full price for massage after a poop accident and she left for half hour? | Throwaway account, and not a shit post! (Pun intended lol)

Warning: this post may be gross.

 I'm a licensed massage therapist. I currently work at a spa, and I pay ""rent"" for my massage room.  Before treatment I ask what areas they want focus on. This client,(F30s?), expressed she was having some pain in her lower back and glute(butt) muscles.
I leave the room, and and I told her to dress down to her comfort level.

This client booked for 1 hour massage. About 15 minutes into the massage, I tell her that I'm going to pull back the sheet and start work on her lower back.

Now the gross part. The client wasn't wearing underwear, and when I pulled back the sheet there was brown liquid mush around her butt crack. This wasnt just a skid mark or not wiping very well, but the sheet now had what appeared to be poop on it. Runny yet sticky at the same time. The sheet was gross.

I've never been in this situation before, and I didn't want to embarrass her. I couldn't continue the massage, it would be a health hazard and it was smeared all over the sheet and some of her lower back. I said to her oh I'm really sorry I think you might need to go to the washroom and clean up a little. I'll give you a few minutes and let me know when you're ready. I left the room and heard her go into the washroom. 15 minutes have gone by and she hasn't come back out, so I knock on the door and ask if she's okay. She responded Yes I'll be out in a minute. But that minute turned into another 15 minutes, so she was in there for a half hour! She came back out and I continued for 15 mins. When I finished, I left the room for her to get dressed and met her up at the counter to pay.

This where I'm wondering if IATA. I charged her the full amount for the massage, because she books the one hour time slot, and I had another client after her so I couldn't exactly run late. She got really mad saying she should pay half the price! I explain that I was sorry, but the hour was booked for her and it would be the same if somebody was late, they would still have to pay the full price of the time slot that they booked. She started yelling at me at the front desk saying how unprofessional I was. She eventually did pay, and later that day there was a review that she posted saying how I ripped her off and charged her more money than the actual massage.
My partner said that I should have given the poor girl a break, she obviously was ill and I should have charged her half of the amount even if it meant I was losing money. My coworker that I discuss this with said any other professional, like a counselor would be charging the full amount that's just what professionals do, and I'm NTA.

0,"AITA for smoking weed in my backyard if there’s a daycare close by? | I live in San Francisco. This is the first living situation I’ve been in where a)*my landlord shares part of the property* and b) *my roommates don’t smoke*.  
I’m naturally a tightly wound person, and I tend to overthink things and be overly cautious about how I’m affecting others. All this said - when I smoke I use the backyard. I’m not worried about bothering my roomates or landlord; rather a daycare ran out a house somewhere up the block on the adjoining street. I really cant tell the distance, but I know it’s at least two yards over and two ‘up’ from ours. I often find myself getting ready to smoke, walking outside and hearing the kids playing in the yard. I’m not sure if I’m just guilt/shame/paranoia trippin’ myself or if I should really feel bad or go back inside if I hear that the kids are outside.

Some more facts:  
The daycare isn’t listed on google maps so I don’t know exactly how far it is. The kids are always screaming, so it seems like it could be close or quite far, I’m tired of listening to hear if they’ve gone inside yet. It just messes up the flow of when I get myself excited to get home, smoke, clean up, change etc.

It’s perfectly legal to smoke on my own (rented, haha) property in the city, and this is often what folks tell me, that I shouldn’t feel bad (or even that the kids could use it /s).

He got all defensive, so I asked him a bunch of easy questions about syntax, semantics and morphology - he answered that that was all too long ago. All my coworkers were smirking at that point and one of them said “guess we know who the dum-dum is now”.

0,"AITA for not aligning with my In-law’s expectations of gender roles and asking my husband to stay home when our sitter calls off? | Backstory: My FIL  and husband are EQUAL business partners of a collision shop. My FIL is the lead when it comes to “back of the house” and my husband is the lead in “front of the house.” They also have two employees working for them, So everything runs real smoothly there and even if someone doesn’t show up, the shop can still run efficiently.

I work as a graphic designer in a VERY small vehicle wrap and sign shop with a total of 3 employees including myself. I get paid well, I get a lot of leniency when it comes to anything at the shop. Basically, I can do what I want as my job is getting done during business hours. I spent years on a degree, which I admit I did not need, however, I am so proud of my work and I love my job. The shop falls behind if I don’t get my tasks completed. 

We had our first/last baby in May 2019. I decided to return PART TIME after maternity leave despite the need for me to come back full time. If I cram an entire weeks worth of work into Monday through Wednesday I still fill the position effectively and I’m still valued. This lets me stay home Thursday and Friday without the worry of childcare. My mother watches our baby otherwise because she asked to. Well, while I really appreciate my mom, she is super flaky, I expected her to be. She’s good for canceling 2-3 times a month on me. So I actually have 2 backup sitters, because if I miss a day of work I set the whole shop back. 

Forward to our recent family debate, argument and eventually my blow-up: TWICE NOW all three of my sitters have been unavailable and it has come down to me or my husband staying home with our kid. My husband wouldn’t mind staying home, he’s not the problem. My FIL straight up looked me in the face and said to me, “you are the woman and the mother, it is your responsibility to stay home if you do not have a sitter.” I’m sorry but I don’t feel this way. I told him as nicely as I could that his son chose to make this baby too and it was also his responsibility. My FIL literally laughed in my face and that’s what pissed me off... I argued with him that we are living in fucking 2020 and that his beliefs on gender roles are fucking stupid. I already (and happily) miss out on two days of work. I need to be reliable for the other three I am scheduled to be there so that I am not replaced. My husband can’t be fired from his own business and it’s not like we lose money if he takes a day off occasionally on the freak occurrence that all 3 sitter options are unavailable. I screamed at him that I was sacrificing a lot for my child but I wasn’t going to give up something I love so much. I called him an asshole as he shook his head and I slammed the door. Nothing like this has ever happened, he’s been very supportive the whole 10 years I’ve been apart of the family but this seems like a no-brainer to me. 

Am I the asshole for not taking my FIL’s gender role bullshit and asking my husband to stay home with our child when our child care options fail, instead of me?",False,False
1,"AITA giving away our daughters dog after she broke her promise | Asking on behalf of my wife and I, so should be “are we assholes.”

Our daughter (11) has begged us to get her a dog for years. We’ve put it off as we have three other younger kids and don’t have the energy to care for a dog on top of that. 

She kept begging and begging as kids do and eventually we relented on the condition that she takes care of him. This includes feeding him, walking him, cleaning up after him, etc. We said this in no uncertain terms multiple times and ofcourse she agrees because she wants a dog.

So we got her a border collie puppy. She looks after it for about a month but begins to slack. Whenever we remind her of our agreement she would take care of it for a week and then stop. This goes on for about 6 months before we get sick of it. My wife and I are the ones taking care of him while my daughter just plays with him. We give her one last chance and sure enough she stops after about a week.

So I let her say goodbye to her pup and sent him away to live on a farm (not a euphemism, he’s literally going to become a farm dog on my uncles farm).

All our friends think we went too far. Wife is having doubts as our daughter is very broken up over it.

0,"WIBTA if I did not let my sibling eat animal products in my home? | For background, my SO and I are both vegan and have been for 2 and a half years. There are many reasons why, including the typical reasons, but I have allergies to animal products which are avoided in a vegan diet so it's like getting two birds stoned at once. My sibling is twice my age (I'm in my 20s) and we were both born in the same country but I grew up in a western country and she still lives in the same country.

My sibling will be visiting my SO and I in the near future and we are excited for her to visit. But... we are on the opposite sides of the dietary spectrum. Inevitably, the food conversation came up. We expect her to eat vegan with us but she doesn't want to budge. She will be spending a few days with some extended relatives of ours who eat meat-heavy so in my opinion, she won't miss out. I don't have any issue with my sibling using her own money to buy animal products but she wants to accompany the meals we cook with animal products and doesn't want to eat ""fake meat"" which I understand. We don't really buy meat-alternatives unless we are with omnivores at a BBQ or something. Also, I do not want her to use my utensils or pans or sponges or sinks because of my allergies. For example, I have a ""typical"" dairy allergy which is the most prominent one and while it's only ""serious"" if I ingest any, even touching dairy will give me major hives. Her other compromise is to only have dairy and eggs but those are still animal products and dairy allergy aside, we aren't comfortable with those being in our home.

My SO and I are not comfortable with buying any animal products for her as it goes against our own beliefs. My sibling is not paying for any part of her visit which I don't mean to hold over her head or anything but it means that we would be breaking our own morals for her comfort since we'd be buying her food for the majority of her trip. She has pointed out that we buy animal products for our pets but I personally do not believe in imposing my diet on obligate carnivores that we chose to adopt. Animals are viewed differently in her culture which I acknowledge but I don't believe humans will die from a few days of eating no animal products. We want her to be as comfortable as possible and acknowledge that her cultural experience with food is different from our own but my sibling and I cannot find a good resolution or compromise.

0,"AITA for wanting to return the ""perfect"" gift? | Hi all, this is my first time posting so please bear with me. 

I am a 26M living at home with my parents. My older sister is 30 and my brother-in-law is 34 and they both are not living with us. 

This past Christmas, I received a gift from my older sister and BIL. They kept telling me how this was the ""perfect gift"" for me and how it's the ""best gift ever"" so when it came time to open gifts with my family, I eagerly tore into it. It was a brown, checkered blazer. I like blazers and I like how this blazer looked so I thanked my sister and BIL for the gift. 

That evening, after my sister and BIL left, I tried on the blazer and looked at myself in the mirror. The blazer was too long in the sleeves and too wide in the body. In other words, it did not fit me. I asked my parents for their opinion and my dad agreed that it was too big on me, but my mom said I should just shorten the sleeves and it would be fine. 

I didn't want to keep a blazer that didn't fit me, so I texted my sister telling her I appreciate the gift, but the blazer doesn't fit and asked for the receipt so I can exchange it for a size that fits me better or return it. My sister tells me in an annoyed tone that she has the receipt but I should just get it altered. 

Yesterday, I saw my sister and BIL at another family gathering and they told me how the jacket is worth $300 but they bought it at a department store for $30. They also told me that they went to that department store to look for a blazer for my BIL and found this one but it was too small for him so they decided to give it to me instead. I told them I don't want to spend money on alterations and would instead like to exchange or return it. 

My mom and dad are telling me I should keep it and get it tailored since it's a $300 jacket. My sister and BIL are upset that I want to return it, and said if I did return it, to give them the $30 they spent on it back. I sense that everyone thinks it would be rude of me to return the gift.

Last month during spring break, I was feeling pretty low after my boyfriend broke up with me. I made a tinder just to mess around, and ended up meeting a guy I liked. He seemed pretty cool, had all the same interests and music taste.

His mom took us out to dinner, I had an okay time. Told the guy we’ll call Andrew that his mom made me a little anxious because she was so overbearing. Well, he told her what I said, and made her dislike me. I was upset, but whatever, he apologized and that was that.

Fast forward a little later, I was asking a friend for advice on what to do because I didn’t think I liked him “like that”. I felt bad because he told me how much he liked me and I just didn’t feel the same. After getting his advice I made plans to tell him tomorrow. The mistake that I know I made, and shouldn’t have done, was I let Andrew put his fingerprint in my phone. I was thinking “maybe I should delete these.” And then my second thought was “no, I trust him not to look through my phone.”

Well, he did. He read the messages between my friend and I. While I was sleeping. He left my apartment at 3AM, and drove 45 minutes back to his house. His friends were calling me every name under the sun in the Discord he added me to. His reasoning was he had the right to look through my phone because I let him enter his fingerprint. I’ve learned my lesson with Tinder, at least.

I told my Fiance that I would like to have a child free wedding because I do not want babies and little ones screaming, crying, or running around during our ceremony and reception.  This is our special day and I do not want that annoyance. Especially during vows!  

My Fiance however said that he wants his 11 year old son and his 4 year old niece to be apart of the day and be in the pictures and what not. I told him that i understand this, I really do. But I want this to be elegant. Not like a back yard barbeque.  I also told him that I want to be his focus on our big day and feel his son especially will want most of his focus as he always does when he is around.

1,"AITA for asking to reduce the amount of time my step daughter stays with us? | Not using my regular account because there are identifying details about me on there.

I've been married to my husband for just over a year and dating him for just over two. He has a daughter from his first marriage, Ali, who is 11. Up until recently Ali has been staying with us three nights a week and alternate weekends but she's been getting more and more difficult to deal with. 

She started acting out just after the wedding and her behaviour just keeps getting worse. She doesn't listen to me at all; if I ask her to tidy her room or brush her teeth she'll always respond with in a minute or similar things but not actually do it until my husband tells her to. She won't acknowledge me as her step mother at all, she only ever refers to me by name if she's asked who I am, if she's absolutely pushed to describe who I am in relation to her she says I'm her dad's wife. I've tried so hard to connect with her, I've invited her on shopping trips or to go out for food but she always rebuffs my offers. She often answers back to me and my husband and will be snappy and moody in general a lot of the time.

In the last few months my husband and I have been talking about trying for our own baby but the atmosphere and stress surrounding the house on days Ali is here are starting to worry me. I struggle to cope with her behaviour now, being pregnant is only going to make it harder. 

So my husband and I discussed it and decided it would be better to cut down on some of Ali's time with us. Instead of three days every week and alternate weekends we agreed to three weekdays one week then the weekend of the following week then back to three weekdays the week after that and so on. It's not a huge reduction but it will really lighten the load for me.

My husband talked to Ali's mother about this and she is furious. She called me some horrible names and blamed me for everything, she even accused me of trying to push Ali out of the picture to create my own perfect little family which is completely untrue.

We decided to update our will and decide our children's guardian. My brother lives in the same city as us with his wife and knows our kids the best of all our close relatives. 

I asked him to be our children's guardian if both of us die. 

He replied, ""Whoa, that's a pretty big ask. "" 

I said, "" I know. Obviously take some time to think and discuss with Ann. We would definitely be leaving money for the kids' needs, but they know you two the best. If we both die, we don't want them in foster care and we want them to be with thd people that know them best.""

He immediately replied he didn't need more time and definitely wouldn't be able to take them. I said ok and stopped the conversation there,  but I was upset. I understand it's a lot to ask, but isn't that what family is for? To back you up when things go seriously wrong?


I didn't bring this up again with him. A week ago , he calls me and asks for a significant amount of money. Because of the current situation he and his wife are out of work and they have a lot of loans and other bills to pay. We couldn't give them this amount of money without dipping into our savings.  Normally I would have bit the bullet and after discussing with my husband given  him as much as we could. But now that I know that if things get bad for us, he won't be there to help me, I'm not really motivated to help. He got angry at me and accused me of refusing only because he wouldn't take guardianship of the kids.

Their marriage was both their second marriage and they both had daughters from their previous marriages. After the ugly divorce, my father chose to stay out of my life to avoid the drama with my mother and focused instead on raising his daughter from his previous marriage. We did not communicate or see each other until I was 10 years old. 

My mother went to live with her ex-husband after she divorced my dad. I don't believe that they were romantically involved but they lived together again when I was young. I remember living in my sister's dad's (we will call him John) house for years. He treated me like a second daughter. After they moved apart again, on weekends when my sister would leave to visit her dad, I went too. I had my own room in his house, went on family vacations, visited his family events, attended the wedding of his new wife, played with his new sons after they were born, etc. They always felt like an extension of my own family. I could call them at any time, day or night, and if I needed something, they would do their best to help. After I turned 14, John and his family moved out of state but we kept in touch over the years. I visited and stayed with his family when I was a teenager and whenever they visited our home state, we would meet up for dinner and catch-up. 

My father and I are now quite close after almost 20 years of slowly re-building our relationship while I am not in contact with my mother at all. 

John passed away today from cancer. It was tragic and sad. The diagnosis came suddenly and his death followed very shortly after. I was only able to say goodbye through an email and couldn't even speak to him.

After I heard the news, I ended up posting to Facebook about my grief that he had passed. My sister had done the same. I stated that it was a weird relationship that we had but I loved him all the same. I said that he raised me and was a prominent father figure early on in my life even though in our later years we weren't in contact as much. 

My mother's family started posting their condolences and how he stepped up to raise me, how he was a second dad to me, and how he was a great man to take me on as his own. 

All of these posts have now led to my father contacting me via text to take the post down. He stated that it was attention-seeking. That I was stealing my sister's grief and that the post was factually inaccurate. He called it 'airing dirty laundry' from the family and that it shouldn't be posted about to family and friends.

I got an email from Uber a short while later and they said it was against their policy for a driver to pick up a child without an adult and this could lead to the driver’s termination. I am afraid I overreacted but think this was ultimately the right thing to do because I do not believe a very young child should be in an Uber alone. I never received follow up from the police, and everything was probably fine it was just a situation which felt uncomfortable.

0,"AITA for pretending to be religious to get in to a good school? | So I grew up in a relatively poor area of a big city in the UK. When it came to thinking about doing my A-levels (16-18) it was looking quite likely that I would stay on at my local comprehensive. Most of the schools around me had poor performance at A-Level and were quite rough. However, there was a Catholic school that had a great college attached (one of the best in the country). You needed good grades to get in but also a 'religious reference' from a vicar, imam or whoever. You didn't need to be Catholic, just a member of any religion.

 A year before I would be applying, I started going to a church nearby and in fact went every Sunday for that entire time. I even went to a ten week course that the church encouraged new members to go to (it was called the Alpha course) where they discussed religious themes and what it meant to be a Christian. I was open to the idea of religion to begin with, but very quickly realised it wasn't for me. Truthfully, my only motivation for going was selfish as I knew I needed the vicars signature when college applications would come around. 

Sure enough, when the time came I asked the vicar to sign my reference and off I went to the good school. I stopped going to church pretty soon after that and never really looked back. I did feel bad at the time but it felt like something the local schooling system forced me to do in order to reach my potential. Fast forward 10 years, I went to a good university and now have a successful career as a doctor. I feel like this was a really defining decision in my life and I have no doubt that had I gone to a rubbish school I wouldn't have gotten the grades that I needed to study medicine.

So a few weeks ago, I was feeling a little bit under the weather and threw up as soon as I woke up. I notified my senior associate and told her that I won’t be coming to work as I’m not feeling well. She was a bit disappointed but had no choice but to allow me a sick leave. 

I sent a few emails to our client as per requested by her the previous day and tried to get some sleep. As I’m trying to get some sleep, she kept on texting me with things that I needed to do. I tried to ignore it and turned off my phone’s notification so I can get some sleep. Around an hour later, she called me and told me that I have to sent her a file (regarding client’s data which she doesn’t have on her laptop) immediately as it is an urgent matter. I sent her the files she wanted and asked her if she’ll need anything else as I’m going to the doctor and won’t be bringing my laptop with me. She said that’s all for now.

I went to the doctor, and the doctor said I’m overworked (I’ve been working overtime till 2-3AM for the past 2 months) and needs some rest. On my way home, my senior again texted me and told me to get our client’s billing information (something that she could do herself as she also have their contacts).

I know the title is a bit weird, so I'll explain. My girlfriend is a gamer, I suppose. She grew up playing video games and she's always playing them when she gets the chance. Me, not so much. I grew up not playing games, but ever since we started dating, it's something fun we've done together, and I honestly enjoy it. I feel like it's something healthy for the both of us. In turn, she's also taken to my interests as well, such as baking and snorkeling.

In one game, she'll purposely put the camera under the characters skirt before the character moves away. In another, she'll comment on the characters hips and thighs and call him ""swole"" and pretend to drool. She'll always comment on any character if she finds them attractive and is always saying she would ""smash"" them. All in all I sort of find it as inappropriate behavior, so I called her out on it one day. I told her how it made me feel, and she said she was sorry saying ""Oh it's just a joke. Don't worry."" When I asked her to not do it anymore she said okay. 

But one day when I came home from work, she was on mic with some online friends again and she was telling her friend to pan the camera around the characters chest, which was nearly out in full display. I confronted her about it, and she said it wasn't a big deal. I told her she promised she wouldn't do it anymore, but she retorted that when I wasn't home, she could do as she liked, and the only reason she didn't do it around me was because she saw it made me uncomfortable.

She said that it wasn't like she was displaying that sort of behavior around people we knew in public, unless they were close friends that knew how she was. We went back and forth a bit, and at the end of it she looked at me as if I was crazy and said okay.

She's a student right now and works part time but barely makes enough to pay her rent/school fees.

I'm 24 and work a minimum wage + commission job, I have barely any money saved so she doesn't understand why I spend so much money/time with family 

We've been dating 3 years with no problems except for this, we love each other and live independent lives but she worries that I'm too focused on helping my family and making them happy instead of building a future for us. She's working as much as she can to pay her bills but because shes a student and also doing her required interning she can't work much more. She doesnt ever ask me for money to help her right now because she wants me to save up.

She doesn't have a family like mine so she doesn't understand, my family is close and I really want to take care of them. She says that I'm supposed to be worrying about my own future right now. She says that she doesn't understand because my mom recently received about ~100k for a settlement and bought a house and a new car and I shouldn't be worrying about helping when they seem fine.

She is angry that I dont take my life seriously, I've been trying to get my real estate license for a few months now but cant find the time to study because of how demanding my family is, they get really angry/sad when I'm not around for family events and I understand why, we're a close family. I get where shes coming from but I cant drop my family. I told her all of this and she got angry saying that shes not asking me to abandon my family, she just wants to make sure we have a solid foundation before we worry about helping my family. And I cant build a future if I'm always with them.

She expects me to start saving up money for a downpayment on a house while she finishes and gets her degree and can start helping as well but I keep telling her my family needs me first. 

We had a particularly heated fight, the worst we've ever had last night and she said she feels like I'll never care enough about my future and I'm supposed to be building one for myself and her and she can't be with someone like that. She said if I really feel like helping my family comes before my own future than that is my choice but she's going to have no choice but to worry about herself from now on and plan a future where shes her only priority because I make it sound like I don't want to be part of it. 

Shes stopped mentioning anything about it and is now talking about saving up for a one bedroom apartment and a car for herself (she lives in a basement). She seems so sad but I cant help but feel like shes wrong for even asking me to not help my family.

By now, she's remarried and the second baby with her second husband is on the way. Partly, it seems like she wants E not only to always love her and never be cross with her, but she also thrives on her child being dependent (she's not potty-trained and regresses when she hasn't her mother's undivided attention, like pretending to be unable to feed herself as soon as her mother has visitors or is on the phone). She never scolds the child for being naughty, she comforts the child even when wrong and tries to prevent every frustration of the child's desires.  

Now, the problem is this: She doesn't allow her new husband to play any role in the life of E. E is a terrible child, pouty, manipulative and outright savage. Her doting mother S is ALWAYS on her side and lets her do whatever she wants. S tells me things like how she thinks naughty, misbehaving children are cute and that she wants to ""protect"" her child. I might add that S suffers from severe anxiety disorder, so I do not trust her to actually be able to make the difference between a real threat and an imagined one. Whenever her new husband tries to make E behave, E ends up screaming and throwing a tantrum. 

Of course, S steps in, blames her husband, consoles the child and basically rewards the child for first misbehaving and then making a scene about being told off. S says she doesn't want her kid to be ""sad"" and that she doesn't want E to ""not get along"" with her new husband, so she is angry with her  hubby for not letting E behave like a rabid monkey. She also admits that she herself, a grown woman, is ""traumatised"" by these altercations and she projects that hurt onto her child.  I am very afraid for the baby who is going to be born into a divided family, where her mother will favour her firstborn because ""it has always just been the two of them"" and ""E doesn't have anyone else"" (even though her father is still in the picture) and a step-father who will soon give up on raising her as his own when the mother refuses his help.

Yes, S has said that she doesn't want any intervention into her relationship with E. She's already dividing the children by wording like ""my child"" and ""his child"" and the husband's family will definitely make the children feel the difference, so I think that the mother of the kids should not reinforce that division.

I am pretty sure that she's raising an anxiety-riddled, narcissistic bully who could end up hurting her baby sister and I believe that S, the mother, should be told. WIBTA for GENTLY letting her know that she's harming E, her marriage and potentially her baby by refusing to say ""no"" to E ? Should I just keep quiet?

1,"AITA for reminding my daughter it was her choice to have an abortion? | My daughter got pregnant at just 18. She promised her boyfriend wore protection. I went with it but I honestly doubt it. The problem is, she did not want to abort the baby and that they both decided they want to keep it despite still being so young (her bf is 19). I convinced her that this is a terrible idea. She is still very young and definitely not mature enough to move out and start a new life. She has college to finish and I can’t just let this not happen anymore. When I told her this she said she already thought about this. Her plan is move to her boyfriends house and live with his family until she finishes college. I don’t know what got into her mind thinking this would be a good idea. I told her she must change her mind or else her future will be destroyed. I contacted his boyfriends parents who were also against this idea and luckily were able to change their sons mind. My daughter however is stubborn enough to want to keep the baby. I made it clear that if she keeps this child she will be kicked out of the house and no one from our family will contact her anymore (I obviously didn’t actually mean it). This wasn’t enough to change her mind though. I literally had to contact her boyfriends parents and BEG THEM to tell their son to tell her he will break up with her if she refuses to abort the child. Only then she thankfully changed her mind and aborted it.

These past few weeks though she has been acting much different. She started bringing up this abortion and asking me why I was so against it. I tried to calmly explain to her why it is such a horrible idea to have a child at such a young age but she then started crying and told me that she would have managed this if I would have supported her. I literally had enough and straight up told her it was her decision to abort it. Yes we were against it. But she had the final say to this and she did it. This just ended up making things worse for us. My husband told me that I was really harsh and should understand that she is going through a rough period. I honestly don’t know anymore.

Story starts 2yrs ago. Place I worked had a holiday special for 40% off all merchandise. My fam all gave me a list & said they’d pay me back when they see me. NP. Kim was the last to send her list & she sent it on the last day. I told her I’d try my best to get her everything but there’s people before her. She said to get her stuff 1st. I replied 1st come 1st serve. She told me to skip my lunch break & get her stuff. If anyone has worked in retail during holidays, u kno how exhausting it is & all u want to do is sit down. None the less, I was able to get everything for everyone. They were fine getting their items when we had our Christmas party but Kim kept pestering about when I was coming over (I didn’t drive at this time. She did.) She’s notorious for shorting people of lose change & my older sister warned me she’d do the same. I just thought well If she does, I’ll let her know it’s rude, & a normal person would realize that & apologize. Find out we’ll both be going to my lil sisters game & Kim keeps texting me to bring her items. I give her the total ($111.74). Give her, her stuff & she says she FORGOT to bring money, she’ll owe me, remind her when I come over for Christmas. Dude really? U reminded me everyday & u FORGOT? & I have to remind u when to pay me back for a FAVOR I did for u? Forward to Christmas she says she doesn’t have cash rn. I had to remind her for weeks until she saw my older sister & gave her just $111. At this point I was irritated but texted her in a joking way & said “hey dude, ur total was $111.74 lol” she says“And? Do u want the 74 cents or something? Lol” “Idc about the 74 cents. But its the principle of the matter. It’s rude. Plain & simple.” She said “We’re family. I didn’t think you’d care about money like that lmao” we went back & forth & the whole time she was being condescending, saying “do u want ur 74 cents or something? U need 74 cents?” I got mad & said “Don’t ever talk to me again. Bye” she replied “ok, that hurt” & we haven’t spoke since. Few weeks later my cousins get me in a room & tell me she told them what happened & I need to apologize or I’m no longer invited to family vacays. I said if she wants to tell me something, tell me. Don’t get other people to do it for her. So AITA? What should I do? I’m seriously tired of the high & mighty attitude she has towards the younger kids.

1,"AITA found lost dog spent my day looking because of reward, now they claim they don't have money so I still have the dog | Hi there,

My friend thinks I'm an asshole but I'm pretty firm on not the asshole here.

I saw a sign in the neighborhood with a picture of a lost dog. It stated reward was $1000.

I  spent half my day driving around looking for this thing because I could  use the cash. I ended up spotting it at a local taco shop where strays  are known to hang out (no joke), grabbed it, contacted the owner.

I  was working out the logistics and the owner said they don't have the  money to pay me the reward. That sucks, but the reason I spent my day  looking for this dog was to get the reward. I told them I'm not going to  give the dog back until I get the reward. At least half of it. They are  pissed. I really don't know what to do at this point because I don't  want this dog, but I really don't want to give it back until I get at  least $500 for spending half my day looking.

If  there was no reward on the poster , or if it was a low amount I  wouldn't have bothered driving around for hours. I feel like it was  deceptive of them to list a reward if they aren't going to pay me for my  time.

I honestly think it's a pretty dumb idea to get a job as a server and work for $3 or something and then gamble on getting tips to at least get up to minimum wage.

0,"AITA for telling my partner to not come home after a night out | Tonight was long, exhausting and quite possibly could have gone better. 

Before tonight my partner had spent the last few days in hospital with our 4 month old son. She wanted to spend the night out together and have a few drinks without our oldest child (4, austitic). 

We went out for dinner at around 6pm with our 4 month old, 2 year old and one of her friends. Dinner was great kids were happy and partner plus friend said they were going to have a smoke. During this time I took the 2 year old into the playground and had the youngest with me in the pram. 

~20 minutes later at 8pm my partner returned gathering her credit card and exclaiming that shes going to the poker machines with her friend and will be back soon... this is where things went downhill. 

Whilst they went off to have some time together I stayed with the kids at the playground waiting for there return so we could go home. We had arrived in one car and I had the least amount to drink so I thought best to wait it out while she had some de-stress time.

Time went on and on and at some point my phone battery died. Tantrum and bottles later I had two very tired kids ready to go to sleep yet still no sign of mum and friend. I spent some time walking around looking for a clock as children are not allowed on premises after 10pm yet could not find any in sight. 

10pm rolled around as i was asked to leave with the children. Heading to the car I still had yet to hear or see any sign of them, baby had woken for bottle and toddler ready to tear the roof down. After feeding the baby and putting both kids to sleep I started doing laps of the small car park in hopes they would show up.. for 40 minutes. 

At 10:40 I bit the bullet and left to source a phone charger to atleast try make contact. Upon turning on the phone, no missed calls or messages. I called my partner, fuming at this point and told her we were asked to leave to which her response to her friend was ""what should we do, I want to stay out for the night"" 

This just added fuel to the fire as I was extremely frustrated from making the children wait so long and late with no effort to communicate these intentions to us. 

I left and told her no to bother coming home tonight as she won't be welcome. She has since caught a taxi to her friends house where they will be staying the night.

0,"WIBTA if I ask my roommates to pay more rent for an extra room for their baby even if I take the master bedroom? | My boyfriend (m22) and I (f20) agreed to move into this apartment with my friend from high school (m21) and his girlfriend (f20), they had previously been living in the apartment with another couple who decided they were ready to move into their own place. Anyway the leasing office is making the whole situation a lot more difficult than it needs to be, so the four of us have decided that we would be better off getting a house instead since combined, we have three large dogs. 

I digress, after this agreement, it’s brought to our attention that my friend’s girlfriend is very pregnant (something that was heavily downplayed before the agreement) and I do not like babies. She will probably be close to 7 months along when we move in. They have no contingency plan for if we can’t find a new place before the 22nd of next month and are relying on my boyfriend and I to secure the deposit and first month’s rent. They’ll pitch in what they can now and will reimburse us for the rest of their half once we get settled because their money is tied up in their apartment right now. We will also be purchasing a w/d and a kitchen table set for the house. Due to this, my boyfriend and I will be taking the master bedroom. 

My friend and his girlfriend are hoping for at least a 3br so that they can have the extra room for the baby. Before this, we were planning on splitting rent and utilities evenly but now I feel that since they want to take two rooms, they should be paying at least a little bit more. I feel bad because the baby was unexpected and they don’t make much money currently, but my boyfriend and I are trying to save up for our wedding and have student loans to pay off among other things.

So last Tuesday I baked some cookies from scratch, they were really really good and she loved them but we didn’t eat all of it at once and saved some for later, I don’t remember the specifics but I’m pretty sure I made around 23 (they were small) and I can’t remember how many exactly but I’m also pretty sure she took more than me, not that I care. 

Anyways since then, they were just chilling in our fridge and originally I left them for her cause It’s one of her favorite pregnancy craving snacks but it seemed that this time she didn’t want to have them, there was 6 cookies left. I didn’t want them to go bad so Yesterday I took them with me to eat during my morning commute. She texted me around lunchtime and asked if I took them and I said yeah cause I didn’t want them to go bad, she didn’t respond to that. When I got home after work, she was sitting on our bed just sobbing and I was concerned and rushed to her side thinking that something bad happened, instead she verbally lambasted me for taking the rest of the cookies and actually had the nerve to call me an “inconsiderate bastard”. I was taken aback and I said “I’m sorry for not asking you if you wanted them but please never speak to me like that ever again”, She screamed at me to get the fuck out and I refused, cause it’s my house too and I’m not leaving over some cookies and she proceeded to pack her bags and go stay at her parents place.

0,"AITA for choosing to change my name even though it will hurt my mother? | So my name, while it has a lovely meaning in my native language and is common in the country my family is from, sounds awful and weird in English. I was constantly teased and tormented throughout my school years and even now at 21, whenever I give my name to people, I can see a few try to stifle back laughter. I get compliments on how ""cool and unique' it sounds at times but I still hate it.

I've always loved the name Jasmine. I think it really suits me. I also like the spelling Yasmine (which would probably honor my ethnic heritage more). I would always wish as a child that I was named it but now that I can change my name legally why not.

I told my mom recently about how I plan to change my name and that I would like her to call me a new name once I change it. She got mad and told me that I have no right to change my name and that it is disrespectful to her and my dad. That it would be like saying that they're not my parents anymore. She said she'll never stop calling me by the name they gave me.

0,"AITA for not giving my ex ""the baby stuff""? | My ex and I split about 4 years ago, when our child was nearly 2. I kept all the baby items from the baby shower: clothes, bottles, crib, etc- aside from things with sentimental value to ex (some clothes blankets, toys), as I had primary custody of our child together. I have since remarried and have a 7 month old, and ex is expecting a child with a new partner. Today, I woke up to several voicemails and text messages demanding all ""the baby stuff"" that was left behind and, supposedly, came from ex's family. This somehow included almost everything that was left (crib, dresser, changing table, bottles, receiving blankets, and more) I said no. 

IMO ex has had 4 years, including the entire time my partner and I were expecting, to lay claim to these items but replacing them midway through my child's first year on next to no notice seems ridiculous. We are not inherently better off financially than ex and their new partner, but we make wiser financial decisions and are more financially stable for large purchases such as these. I'm upset that ex feels entitled to these items, as though my home has just been a storage unit all these years, and that instead of approaching me politely, ex demanded I give them ""back"" and got hostile when told no. Ex is also behind in child support for our child together, which has impacted finances in my home since I am still on maternity leave and only receiving partial pay.

We didn't talk until she informed me that she had given birth to a son, we'll cal him A. I was already moved on from her and had a lot on my plate and told her that. She was quite angry and threatened to take me to court, so we agreed that I would pay child support for him until he was 18. A kept his mothers last name.

we met at my house once about 9 months later with her, A, and her friend. This was the only time that I met A. I held him and looked at this baby and honestly felt no emotional connection to him. This was not my son. I was not his father

A's mother called me once when he was about 3/4 years old and told me that A wanted to meet me and was asking questions about me. I explained to her that I was not willing to do this and had moved on. This was 19 years ago and I haven't thought of them really since and have not told anyone in my family of this.

About 3 weeks ago, A called me. He explained that he didn't feel animosity towards me but wanted to meet me. I hesitantly obliged and agreed to meet him the next week for lunch.

Last week I met A at a restaurant. The second he walked in I recognized him immediately, he looked just like his bother and just like me; tall, slim, short blonde hair, well dressed. I stood up and shook his hand for the first time and looked him in the eye. After greeting each other and making small talk, I started asking about him and was quite impressed. He was 22 years old, an air force pilot who had spent a year travelling north Africa and southeast Asia after high school. I asked about his mother and he asked about me and my side of his bloodline. When the conversation got to my children it became quite tense. He already knew that I had a son (29) and a daughter (32) but asked if they knew about him. I explained that they had no idea that he existed as did the rest of my family. I could see he was disappointed on hearing this. We finished our lunch and agreed to keep in touch. We shook hands and he called me by my first name. During the drive home, I was feeling a bit sad that I had missed out on this boys life.

Throughout the past week I've been really thinking and decided that I want to tell my son and daughter about their brother. I feel that they would be happy with this sort of news but am worried if they'll feel resentment towards me. My mother and siblings have no idea about him either and I feel like they would inevitably find out. What if they accept him and cast away me? will they resent him?

After wrapping gifts, I did dishes and put dinner in the oven, and asked him to turn it off to spend time with me with/without kids. He said no.

I invited some friends from my hometown and booked the rooms, since I get a big hotel discount. I worked overtime for 2 weeks and used the extra money as a budget to set aside for my weekend in the city. While we were out, I got a massive bucket drink under the agreement that everyone would venmo me for part of the cost split up equally. My hometown friends were also in agreement that they would pay me back for the room. As the night went on, one friend refused to pay for cover or drinks, and kept trying to tell everyone where she wanted to go and refused to go on my birthday, so I got fed up and told her if she didn’t want to pay for anything and kept throwing a fit about going to where she wanted to go then she could go home, which she did. I paid for the rest of their covers because one of their cards wouldn’t work and the other had to pay a huge service fee for withdrawing, under the agreement I would be paid back with venmo. In total, they owe me about $150, which isn’t a lot to some, but it is to me as a broke grad student, and it blew my budget for going out. 

They refuse to pay me back- one of them agreed to venmo me and then when I mentioned it the next day, she smirked and said she never had venmo and would never download it. The other two are similar. I tried texting and calling them with no response, and when I sent a paragraph a week and a half later, one of them accused me of being heartless for asking her to pay me back while her dog was in the hospital (which she never mentioned to me at all), and then refused to pay me back, saying I would get the money whenever she felt like sending it. The other two want my exact banking info (routing and account number) to pay me back. When I refused and suggested paypal, venmo, or cashapp, they got angry at me and then stopped responding, leading me to think it’s a scam.

That wasn't very pleasant and since I'm usually more panicky person, I started feeling anxious about coming out to my new roommate. Despite the fact that there were no signs that he's homophobic, he even has LGBT friends, but I just didn't want to potentially go through that first experience again.

I know how the title sounds, but let me explain.

A bit of background: 
Some years ago my mum became pregnant again. We are three siblings already, I was 12 when this happened, my siblings were 7. My mum was already nearing her mid 40s, so we were told the pregnancy was high risk and that it was a very real chance we could lose her and the baby could be premature anyways. In the end, my mum lost the baby around the 4 months mark. She had preexisting conditions such as anaemia and other stuff that was probably what triggered it and which made us worry for her safety during the pregnancy. I was sad when it happened, but relieved because I was scared of losing my mum, and so were my siblings.

I was talking the other day with a friend and somehow, the topic came out. I explained what happened and the circumstances and told her that to this day I am still immensely relieved about what happened. That I get that it really hurt my parents to lose a daughter, but I also told her that, to the mind of my 12 year old self, my mum was the priority, and that when we were told of the risk the baby was posing both me and my siblings started resenting it.

She told me I was an asshole for choosing my mum over a sister that I never even knew, but I know losing my mum would have wrecked us all, my dad could barely care for us then because he was always working, and no kid wants to lose a mother. So, AITA, Reddit?

BackStory: My (26F) fiancé (28M) proposed to me in March 2019. My mom was very excited and couldn’t wait to begin planning. My  fiancé and I live in NorthEast US and my mom lives in the South where I’m originally from. My parents were paying for majority of our wedding, with my mom paying for the most of it. During the planning process, things took a negative turn. My mom was very controlling and our relationship deteriorated. It was to the point that I was having panic attacks whenever My mom and I would have conversations about the wedding. My fiancé and I would make decisions, such as the color scheme, that my mom would not agree with and she would make it known. My fiancé and I were afraid that she would change everything due to us living so far away from the wedding vendors. I have examples if needed. My fiancé and I did agree to a wedding venue in the South and for my mom to put the deposit down. My mom also purchased my wedding dress and stated that it was a gift. 

Fast forward some time, my fiancé and I decided to postpone our wedding until 2021 as we want to focus on purchasing a house and take control of planning/paying for the wedding ourselves w/o the extra drama. We agreed to pay my mother back the deposit for the venue and already paid her back half of the total. She is now asking for me to pay her back for the wedding dress which I do not agree with, as it was a gift. I asked her about this and she stated that it was a gift only if she was paying for the wedding.

WIBTA if I paid her back for the venue but not the wedding dress as it was a gift??

Thank you all for your thoughts.",False,False
0,"AITA for joking about my mother’s death? | For background: My parents have been divorced for years. My (F27) mother passed away a couple months ago. My dad got married a few weeks before she passed. My dad and his new did this without telling anyone in the family. I am not a fan of his wife for various reasons, mostly her personality.

I went over to my father’s this weekend to catch up and try to get to know his wife more. She was a bit cold to me at first (not sure why.. she gets into those moods sometimes) but warmed up.

We sat down to look at the wedding album and halfway through she made a comment that ticked me off; “We would have invited you all [me and my sisters] but.. your mom!”  In a very passive aggressive way because my mom would have been upset by the wedding. 

This pissed me off because I didn’t think it to be her place to say something like that. 

 This is where I may be an asshole. I laughed aggressively loud and said, “HAHA well thank god she’s dead then!!” 

Awkward silence and I ended up leaving shortly after.  Mixed reactions when I tell the tale; my sisters are split on if I’m the asshole, my best friend says I’m not, but my dad definitely does. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for keeping late hours? | So I just moved into a new apartment complex and I’m living on the second floor, we don’t really have any kid of specific “quiet hours” because there’s not a lot of major noise, most people here have kids or live alone. 

I’m a college student and most days I’m in class until about 10pm, my downstairs neighbor apparently goes to bed at 8:30pm.

When I get home I normally make myself dinner,  then I clean the kitchen, do a little homework, watch some tv, shower and go to bed. 

My neighbor is insisting that I’m being inconsiderate and rude, he’s called the landlord on me twice and I’ve literally only lived here for two weeks, we mediated with the landlord, she seemed pretty impartial since the noise isn’t like loud music or fighting, but just me going about my routine. 

I said I would buy an area rug for the living room since it’s hardwood floors and I have, and hopefully that mutes my footsteps a little, but my neighbor now just gives me dirty looks whenever we run into each other outside and I heard him complaining to our other neighbor yesterday about how he’s been having trouble sleeping since I moved in. 

And honestly I feel bad about it, but I hate feeling like I have to tiptoe and whisper in my own houses. 

So basically am I the asshole for not going straight to bed after school?

This is my first time being the upstairs neighbor, in my last unit I was on the bottom floor and the people living upstairs had two kids and a dog and it got loud sometimes, but never loud enough that I couldn’t sleep. ",False,False

So she was already shocked by that and then she saw my cat and said ""aww I have never seen a cat like that before they are so cute"" then I said ""yeah she is a Bengal cat this breed is like 5k per cat wanna hold her?"" Then this girl said ""ok so you brought me here before the date just to flex how much money you have"" I then said no not at all. We went on the date it was horrible she blocked me on ig and that was the end of it. That was Saturday night and I cant help to feel in between if I was in the wrong or not.",False,False
1,"AITA for asking my wife to visit her OBGYN after we have been having trouble conceiving? | As the totals suggests, I [28m] and my wife [27f] have been trying for a child for about 6 months. There are a couple factors at play here as to why we may be having difficulties, so my thought is to rule out as much as possible. She has a bleeding disorder and a family history of ovarian cysts, and I am a bit concerned about whether or not we will even be able to have children. 
Yesterday, we found out that for yet another month, we were unsuccessful. In my frustration, I put my hands on my head and she immediately followed with “why are you making this about you?” I tried to explain that I was struggling with each month getting our hopes up and that she probably felt the same way. She didn’t want to hear my side and it ended in an argument about how I “make it about me.” I can understand how I could have put my feelings aside, but in the moment after hearing a “no” again, I was a bit distraught.
I followed up by suggesting that she go and get a check up. For the last 9 months she has been without insurance (quit her job to pursue a dream of hers, and has no benefits). I recently was able to get her on my benefits, and so this is a possibility. She is making the claim that it is her body, and that it is her decision. I can’t force her to go get checked up. 
Her big Hangup is that doctors typically say that you need to try to conceive for 1 year before bothering them with any concerns of issues with pregnancy. We are at month 6. I suggested that my wife tell a white lie (how will they know when we started anyway?) in order to find out if there are any issues with her bleeding disorder, or cysts. She again reiterated that it isn’t my choice, and that she wanted to wait for a year. 
Again, I am only hoping to rule out medical concerns for conceiving. I in no way an accusatory or think that it is “her fault.” Hell, the problem might even be me? But AITA for asking or requesting that she goes and gets a checkup for issues conceiving? ",False,False
0,"AITA for taking up a job I don't really need, and depriving someone else of that opportunity? | I'll be upfront. I have a sugar daddy arrangement with a great guy, let's call him Mark. Call me what you want, but I've a house in my name, and have enough for me to stop working and live frugally for the rest of my life.

&#x200B;

I work in sales to pass the time in a highly sought after company. Because I don't need the extra money, I'm extremely alright with coming into work and leaving on time. I use all of my paid vacation too. Mark is not frequently in town, but when he is, I set aside time for him. This has rightly landed me near or at the bottom of the company rankings amongst my peers. I do put in my 100% when I am in office, I just don't stay late or come in over the weekends and I take all my vacation days.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, this sticks out like a sore thumb in the company I'm in. The culture is one where everyone works mad overtime just to hit the incentive and performance bonuses. My colleagues have been making many snide remarks about how lazy I am, how my life will amount to nothing and how much more I could be earning if I just worked harder. Because your career is everything, I guess. Just a note, many of them are living decently, but not enough to stop the mad dash. 

&#x200B;

One day, we were out at lunch at a higher priced restaurant (bill came out to be $70 per pax) on a whim. I shocked that this particular group of colleagues asked me, but was happy to join the 5 of them, since it was a while since I went out with them. At one point in the convo, someone commented that we should do this more often because it was nice, and I agreed. Cue an offhand comment of ""Oh AnnualCamel, are you sure you can afford that? We can go to a less expensive restaurant if you want"", and I replied honestly this price was ok, as long as it wasn't /that/ often. Then the bombshell ""Maybe you could if you worked harder, like the rest of us"" was dropped.

&#x200B;

I was so mad, I told them the truth - that I could retire, but was just working because I wanted to stay occupied and because honestly I liked doing the job. They probed more and made a (correct) inference that my money was from a sugar daddy. This for some reason set them all off. They said that I was a massive asshole for stealing the job from someone else who would have appreciated the opportunity to work in the company we were in. And that if I didn't want it I should GTFO and free up the space. They then started rumours in the office about what a slut I was (not even the right insult) and they were sure I was sleeping with the bosses to keep my job (I wasn't). 

&#x200B;

Good grief, so I reported it to HR and the key instigator got her recent promotion removed. I am now even more so the social pariah amongst that group.

0,"AITA for making everyone laugh at my father? | My father has always been a horny gross man. He used to always watch the fashion channel just in the hopes that he'd see a model's boob. Around us kids! And he used to make us go up to our mother and say, ""Tonight's the night, Lars,"" when he was horny. We were young and did not know what it meant. 

He also used to juggle his balls while sitting in his easy chair. And not wash his hands. 

Anyway, all us kids are now grown adults. I was visiting my dad and mom. I walked into the quiet house from the back door. I saw my dad standing at the living room window watching the young girl (around 18 I would say) who worked for the landscaping company at their condo mow the lawn.

He was making they noise Homer Simpson makes when he sees food he wants to eat. I thought it was so creepy so I laughed and told all my brothers and sisters and mother and we all laughed.

1,"AITA for talking about a client’s parents when I didn’t know they had died? | I work on the maintenance team for an apartment complex. Yesterday morning we had a routine job to fix the heater of said client. When she answered the door I was a bit taken aback because she looked to be very young. As we started talking more I found out she was 18 years old and still in high school. 

This is surprising because not only is the cost of living very high in our area, this is also one of the more higher-end apartment buildings in the city. Logically, an 18 year old high school student wouldn’t have the means to live there on their own.

Once my partner and I finished up we headed out the door and as we were walking down the hallway I said to him, “what do you think, trust fund baby or sugar baby?” He laughed and commented that he hoped sugar baby because at least the man paying her rent would be getting something out of it.

At the end of the day after we had finished up we got called into our supervisor’s office. Apparently after we had left, the girl had tried to catch up to us in the hallway to give us a tip and had heard our conversation. She called to leave a complaint, and told my supervisor that her parents had died about a year earlier and she was paying rent with her inheritance. We both got written up.

Here’s my problem. For one, it was clearly a joke, one that both of us had forgotten about by the end of the day. And secondly, I don’t know this girl from Adam. I had no idea her parents had died. If you want to get mad about us joking about you that’s fine, but to specifically get mad because your parents are dead seems irrational when we would have no way of knowing about that. At the very most it’s deserving of a warning but to be written up also seems like a huge overreaction to me.",False,False
0,"WIBTA For going to a temple without my wife | Hello reddit! I'm an Indian American (26M) and a Hindu who got hitched to a white woman (24F) not too long ago. She's an atheist and honestly I couldn't care less. I'm not too religious either and religion rarely comes. I don't really want to ""convert her"" or anything like that and we've already agreed to just let our kids choose whatever they want.

Anyways, we're visiting my grandparents in India and I wanted to go around and see some famous temples. I took her to a few, but there's on major temple left. I don't want to specify which one for privacy reasons but from the way I'm describing it I don't think it'll be too hard to figure out which one. Anyways, this temple only allows Orthodox Hindus entry. I've always wanted to visit it.

An argument started between me and her because she says that she wanted to go too. I explained to her that this wasn't possible because she was not a Hindu. She said she could ""pretend"" to be a Hindu for a short while but I told her I would not be comfortable with that as it is against the temple's rules. The place is meant for spiritual connection and she just wants to see the architecture. She got pretty mad and went on a rant about religion before ""giving in"" and saying that if she couldn't go I shouldn't either.

I think this is ridiculous. I've always wanted to go to this temple and I'm allowed entry. She just wants to ""admire the architecture"", which is fine for most temples, and she's gone to plenty with me already, but for a temple which explicitly bars her from going she should follow the rules. As for her argument she's accused me of being bigoted and intolerant for supporting a temple which does not allow entry to non Hindus. I don't find anything wrong with this as it's explicitly a Hindu place of worship, but that's just my opinion

0,"AITA for telling my mom to stop monopolizing grief? | For backstory, my mom [54F] *has* experienced a lot of grief in her life. Her dad passed unexpectedly when she was 12 (she was born from his first marriage and by the time he passed he was on his third), out of her 7 siblings/ half-siblings 2 of her brothers passed unexpectedly, & when I [28F] was 17, my father whom I was very close to died in a car accident. After he passed, I didn’t speak to my mom for about 5 years; we were never very close & I was angry at her for many reasons. 

When I was 22, my mom & I reconnected; she cut back on drinking & I thought I should give her another chance. One day when she was over at my house, my best friend’s father called me to inform me my best friend since grade school died unexpectedly. My mom, who hadn’t seen her in years & was never around much in my childhood to even know her well, fell to the floor shrieking hysterically & was inconsolable for hours. This upset me & I started thinking she monopolizes grief for herself w/o thinking about how it affects other people.

Another example, when my husband’s very old & ill grandpa passed last year, my mom sobbed when I told her.

Another example, she loves to share photos of passes love ones on Facebook with long, rambling stories. She calls herself a broken hearted widow & garners sympathy; however, she started an affair when I was 12 & eventually was forced to tell my dad when I was 16 because her lover’s wife found out about their affair. So at the time of my dad’s death she was separated. She’s still with that man today but tells nobody. He’s wealthy & takes complete care of her. 

She texts me every year on my best friend’s birthday to “remind” me, like I don’t remember. She didn’t remember my dad’s birthday this year (no long rambling FB post). It was my friend’s bday 3 days ago & when she texted me, I went off on her. I told her I don’t need reminders & to stop posting pictures of my friend with long captions about how it affects HER & monopolizing grief like she always does. She hasn’t responded.

0,"AITA for complaining to my neighbors about their dogs barking and charging the fence? | Background: I live on a couple of acres in a somewhat rural, outside of city limits neighborhood. It’s perfectly acceptable to raise chickens etc. out here and I have several, as well as a few geese, ducks, and a pair of turkeys. They are penned in a run that stretches nearly the entire length of the north border of my property. The neighbor to the north and I are separated by a hedge with a chicken wire fence woven through it.

About a year ago, said neighbor’s girlfriend moved in and brought her Weimaraner with her. The dog barked at the birds CONSTANTLY, barked at us CONSTANTLY, and barked EVEN MORE when we played with our German Shepherd out in the yard. The most that the neighbor and his girlfriend would do was to call the dog inside (when they were home, that is) but he would reappear within minutes because he has a dog door. Thankfully, my husband realized he could lower his voice and yell the dog’s name and a sharp “no!” and scare the dog into silence. Finally the dog got the message to quit barking at us.

Now these same folks have a puppy. They’ve had the new Weimaraner for about six or seven months and it’s the same thing with the additional complication that this one also slams himself into the fence growling and snapping at us. I take my toddler out to feed our birds and collect eggs every morning and I can’t even talk to her or enjoy my time outside because of the noise and watching out to make sure this dog doesn’t come through the hedge and actually attack us.

We wrote the neighbors a note explaining that we can’t enjoy our own yard and pets and what can we do to resolve the situation? Their reply was to tell us that birds are distracting to “hunting dogs” and that we should also expect the dogs to bark when we “approach their yard.” They suggested we relocate the birds and don’t approach their dogs.

First of all, the birds’ run has their pond and all of their nesting sites and coops, and would involve relocating almost 400’ of fence on top of that. Second, their dog is the problem, not the birds. Third, shouldn’t we be able to walk right up to our own hedge without it being considered approaching or annoying their dogs? I plan on replying by telling the neighbors to handle their business or I’ll call animal control, but I’d like to know if I’m at all in the wrong here.",False,False
0,"WIBTA for not wanting my bridesmaid to bring one of her significant others? | I'm getting married in a few months, and getting the invitations together. One of my bridesmaids, a close friend of mine for 15+ years, recently started seeing a married couple almost immediately after a break-up. How she handles relationships and what she does in the bedroom is none of my business, I just want her to be happy, and she certainly seems to be more comfortable and exploring her newfound relationship.

My friend wanted me to meet them so she invited me and my fiancé to a party the couple were hosting so we went. The vibes the couple gave off was...I don't know. My friend seemed to be her normal bubbly self. The wife seemed to keep to herself, but was nice and friendly. The husband didn't seem to pay much mind to his wife except for when they were first introduced. He spent the majority of the night with his hands all over my friend, only acknowledging his wife every now and again. Hell, he was flirting with the other women at the party more than he said a few words to her (and me when my fiancé 
and friend were out of the room). Overall he just seemed like a genuine creeper, and I felt very uncomfortable around him.

I love my friend dearly and I want her to be happy, but I have no idea how to go about this. She's voiced that she'll be bringing him (I put my foot down months ago that she could only bring one of them), and I don't want to single her out. I told her about his behavior towards me at the party, but she insisted he's just very friendly...

I don't want to lose her as my bridesmaid, and I certainly do not want to lose her as a friend either...but am I the asshole if I ask her to bring the wife instead? Or someone else? Or no one at all?",False,False

My gf who I had been with for about a year, decided to follow me a few months later. She had assumed that I would get rid of the dog when she moved in, but I had no plans to. She gets weirdly jealous of the dog, and is insistent that she is in her cage whenever I am not directly petty or playing with it.

1,"AITA for telling people my sister got Botox because everyone keeps saying that she looks younger than me? | My sister is 26 and I’m 22. My sister has always had great skin, I will give her credit for that. She recently got Botox to treat migraines. The Botox changed the symmetry in her face ever so slightly. She has been getting a lot of compliments. 

When we go out together and explain to people that were sisters, they guess that she’s the younger one. I’m gonna be honest and say that it annoys me because she eats it up.

She took me out to lunch yesterday and we got a flirty waiter. Who, again, “gasped” when he found out that I was the younger sister. And I was like “yup Botox will do that for ya!” My sister got mad and was like “what the fuck dude?” But she literally did get Botox. We argued about this, and she’s like “ I always told you to wear sunscreen” and blah blah blah. Like I don’t get acne and like the way her skin looks isn’t genetic. 

She is actually refusing to talk to me if I don’t apologize. I don’t think I did anything wrong, if anything I think she’s an asshole for not telling people that she got Botox. She also does a whole bunch of other stuff to her skin like acid peels and clay masks. And she makes it come off as if she just naturally looks like she does.

1,"WIBTA If I gave a bad review of my friend's book? | So a while back my friend wrote a novel and got it self-published. I brought a copy of the novel to support them and read it. The book was terrible. It reads like amateur fanfiction with blatantly copy+pasted elements from other books and TV shows in the same genre (fantasy). My friend is not a native English speaker and that's an obvious fact when you read their book, the prose of the novel jarring and awkward to read. The actual plot and characters are amateurish even in comparison to published books that I find to be terrible (like Twilight for example).

My friend is very, very proud of the book and wants to get it properly published. They're extremely enthusiastic that everyone should read it (but in a good willed, non pushy way) and gets very excited when someone does. Everyone who's read the book agrees that it's badly written but lies when they tell my friend about it since it's clear it would hurt them if they told the truth. Like with most self-published works, they're relying on their friends and family to buy it, so feedback is lot more personal. I didn't say anything after I read it because I didn't want to lie to them. They've already sunk a lot of money into getting it self-published in the first place.

They also seem quite naive about how the publishing industry works and are taking some pretty big missteps in that regard. It's like they're just following the ""how not to get published"" rules.

I'm also a writer and semi-professional at it with a high degree in the field. Harsh \*but constructive\* criticism is part of the game. I really feel that someone needs to just tell them ""this isn't working, here's why"" before they sink more time and money into it (they want pay to have merchandise made). However, I know that telling them will really hurt their feelings, so I was going to write an anonymous review online (the coward's option, I know.)

And on the flip side, if they want to spend more time and money on a this then why should I stop them? Perhaps they, against my strong beliefs, do get it published and it becomes a best-seller? Stranger things have happened.

So, WIBTA if I wrote an anonymous review of the book, or should I just let things play out?

0,"AITA for wanting to keep a separate bank account from my husband? | (I’m on mobile, so I’m not sure how the formatting will be.)

My husband (28M) and I (27F) been married for three years and lived together for a few years prior to being married. We’ve always handled our finances the same way and he has never expressed any issues with our way of doing things prior to recently. 

Our finances are kept completely separate other than when we pay bills, which we split equally. Every month I add up what we owe for mortgage, electricity, gas, internet, etc., and divide it in half, then tell him how much his half is. He sends me his portion and I pay the bills. I prefer being in charge of this because I have anxiety and will worry constantly about whether or not he paid something on time, and I am also the more organized of the two of us. He’s never complained about this and I’ve even asked him if he minds me talking charge of the bills and he said he doesn’t. He’s happy to just send me the money and forget about it. He says he is still happy with this arrangement, as am I. 

Other than the bills, all of our finances are completely separate. We have separate bank accounts, we both work and both make close to the same amount, but recently I’ve begun making more than him. We could both support ourselves if we lived alone, with some left over. We aren’t rich, but it’s not like either of us is living paycheck to paycheck either. In the past, the only purchases we had to check with each other on were things that affected the other person, such as a new pet, new furniture for the main area of the house, etc., because that’s common courtesy. 

Recently he’s been wanting us to have a joint bank account where we put all our savings, and to talk with each other before making expensive purchases. When I ask him why he says he wants us to be better at saving money, and he wants to feel like we’re building a life together. He never used to care about what I spend my money on, but recently he’s begun getting annoyed when I make expensive purchases. We own our house and are not planning on having children so it’s not like there’s a joint expense we both want to save up for. 

I really don’t want to change the way we handle money. I’m better at saving than he is. He pretty much just blows his money on whatever after the bills are paid, and I put a good amount into my savings account each time I get paid. He doesn’t have any savings, I do. I don’t care what he spends his money on as long as the bills get paid, which they do, and I’m feeling annoyed that he doesn’t extend me the same courtesy anymore. It bothers me that he’s begun complaining about my expenses, even though they don’t negatively impact him at all, and I’m not comfortable with the idea of having a joint bank account since we have very different ways of handling our money. I’m happy with the way things are. He isn’t. AITA?",False,False

She likes it though and now that she is allowed to have it dyed at work she went ahead and asked what color she should get. I told her that I didn’t want her to, because I didn’t like her with dyed hair. She got upset and wanted me to be supportive so I helped her choose a color. 
She dyed her hair and i guess it looks alright, but I can’t help but get this bad feeling in my gut and my head when I see it.

1,"AITA for telling my fiancée she is too sensitive? | My (27M) fiancée (25F) and I have been together for three years and I love this woman with all my heart. We were supposed to get married this April but we have a global crisis going on so that obviously didn’t happen. My fiancée’s personality is very sensitive for the lack of a better word. She’s a very shy and quiet person, and she apologizes for everything all the time. So we’ve been living together since early March and her cat has been sick for a while and passed away yesterday. She’s had this cat since she was on her own after getting out of college and the cat was very old and lucky to live this long. My fiancée does not have a good relationship with her family because of how abusive they were to her when she was younger and I think she got this cat to start her new life and not be alone. Honestly I’m not really a fan of cats, yes she was sweet but I tolerated the cat because my fiancée adored her. Well yesterday my fiancée started crying a lot, for like 3 hours straight, I’ve never seen her this upset, she’s cried before but never to this extent. I consoled her and held her yesterday and I tried to cheer her up this morning by showing her a puppy we might be able to get soon. She started crying again, and all I said was that she’s just too sensitive if looking at puppy is making her cry again.

1,"AITA for refusing to re-rack my weights at the gym? | I know it's proper gym ettiquete at most gyms to re-rack all your weights, that was the case at my last gym and I always re-racked my weights.

For the past 6 years I've been working out at my stations gym, I love it, has everything I need and usually I'm the only one working out. For the past 6 years I really only see the same 5-6 people working out at different times, everyone else comes in from time to time. I've repaired a lot of the equipment here from my own pocket, bring in gear like belts, chalk, rope, etc for everyone to use.

Well a few days ago I was squatting 225, after I was done with my sets, I took one 45 from each side off and left one 45 on both sides of the bar. I then went to do some deadlifts. In the middle of my set a woman(who I've never seen before) comes up to me and traps me on the shoulder. I put the weight down and take my headphones off. She asks me if I'm done with the squat rack, I said ""yeah go ahead"" and put my headphones back in. She motions again and says ""well you need to put your weights back on the racks"". I look at her with a confused look. She says that the weights can bend the bar (no they won't) and some people who work out there can't move 45 lbs by themselves (she wasn't talking about herself, I saw her benching 135). I told her if someone can't lift 45 lbs by themselves then they shouldn't be touching a barbell unattended( the bars are 45 lbs themselves), I then put my headphones back on and continued my workout ignoring her. She walked away mad and started to take pictures of the bar with the weights on and then pictures of me (idk what she was planning in doing with them and I didn't really care).
So my reasoning is this, there is not enough weigth trees for all the weights in the gym. In this gym it's customary to leave one 45 on each side of the bar, this includes the squat rack, all the bench presses, the deadlift area. Most people who workout here often are powerlifters, we just have this unwritten rule to leave the bar at 135, no more, no less. We rack the dumbbells and everything else but leave the bar at 135.
So AITA? I would have probably took the weights off if she didn't demand that I do so.

0,"AITA Escape room edition | God this is such a first-world problem. But I feel really stuck on what to do.

I'm visiting with the in-laws this week, who are your pretty typical in-laws. They're obnoxious, loud, pushy. They're not bad people, but I get really tired of being around them very quickly. 


His parents always want to do escape rooms every time we're together, which isn't too often as we live far from them. But the last time we did one, I had it. His mom shushed me even when I wasn't even speaking, she took objects right out of my hands, and got mad at me and the others during the entire experience. Afterward, I made it clear I did not enjoy the experience and really didn't want to do it again. When we came home this time, someone suggested we all do another one, and everyone kind of mumbled and looked at me like ""we can't. Koeghls doesn't want to."" Which, I don't. 


Well she just texted my fiance and said she wants to do one tomorrow night. So I'm stuck. I could either just say I'll sit this one out, but I know they'll say ""then we won't do it."" Or I can suggest I go but sit outside and read (I love reading). Or I can just suck it up and just not participate (I'd really just be a warm body in the room but at least everyone else would go do it).

1,"AITA for making my gf pay to sleepover? | I (28M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) for about a year now and things have been going really well up until recently. We live in separate apartments and were spending about one night a week together at my place, but recently it has turned into three or four nights a week. 

Now, don't get me wrong... I love having my girlfriend sleepover and I could even see us living together one day... However, when I asked her to start paying $24 each night she stays over, she got really upset. I explained that all of my utility bills have gone up significantly since she started staying over more and that $24 for one night in an $1800/mo apartment is a great deal. Heck, I wish I got to live in my apartment for that little. 

Anyway, her and her friends think I'm being unreasonable and her friends are telling her to dump me. I really love her and don't want to lose her, but I'm afraid of ending up in a relationship where bills aren't split equally and I don't want to be with someone who just sees me as a meal ticket. I think it's reasonable to ask her to help pay for things now that she's spending more time at my place, but maybe I'm wrong... AITA?

0,"WIBTA If I told my boss to disable a camera? | I am a temporary intern at a place in the US and at this position housing is provided. It's an apartment style place with shared bedrooms and one large living room / kitchen area that all the interns share. There is also a camera in the corner of the living room. This camera can move and turn and it's controlled by my boss. Apparently some past interns got into some trouble and this camera was installed. For a while it was facing away from the living room and didn't move so I gave it no thought, assuming that since none of us had done anything to warrant supervision, I figured the camera was disabled. A few days ago however, the camera started moving around and now a small light is blinking which I assume means it's active. When I was sitting in the living room today I heard talking and couldn't figure out where it was coming from. Then I turned and saw the camera was on so I gave it an awkward wave and then I heard some laughing, so I guess there's a speaker attached too?? This makes me very uncomfortable. There aren't any cameras in our rooms but I feel weird that I could be minding my business on a day off and someone could be spying on me! I'm not sure if they can hear us talk either - what if I had a bad day and want to vent and my boss hears me? However I'm only here for 4 months and I don't own this place or pay any rent. I have privacy in my room too. Obviously if we are doing something against the rules or illegal I can understand why they would want to know about it.

The crosswalks near the school are all manned by a crossing guard. I've been driving through this intersection for 3 years and have never had an issue before. 

I pulled up to the intersection and the crossing guard had the other cross-direction of traffic halted and the pedestrians/students were crossing.

1,"AITA for not punishing my daughter for standing up to her cousin? | Hi all. 

My sister Eleanor and her husband Paul were staying over at our place for my much younger brother's wedding over the weekend.

Eleanor and me have daughters who are both 15. My daughter is called Sarah and hers is Becky. They are both very pretty but are polar opposites in terms of personality. Becky is very confident, outgoing, has loads of friends and is a huge party girl. She's also very capable academically and according to Eleanor is top or near the top of most of her classes. Sarah is the opposite. She is a kind and gentle person but is sensitive and at times awkward, with major issues with her confidence. She has a few very close friends rather than being part of a large group. Her academic performance is decent but not exceptional like Becky, but we are nevertheless proud of her because we know she works hard at school. 

Becky bullies Sarah and has done for a long time. She is spoiled by her parents who think that it's ''just harmless kid stuff''. Just this weekend she told Sarah that she was too ugly to go the wedding and that she would have to stay out of the photos. She also tried to push her out of big family photo at the reception. My wife Diane had to find Sarah after she ran outside crying. This bullying has gone on for years and nobody has made an attempt to stop it. 

Sunday morning in the garden we heard someone scream inside the house. We ran into the kitchen to find Becky feeling around the kitchens trying to find her glasses. She has very bad eyesight, bad enough that according Eleanor she needs to feel around for her glasses on her bedside table since everything is a blur for her. She has worn glasses in a high prescription since she was a baby. 
Becky was crying her eyes out until Diane found her glasses in one of the food cupboards. Once she had got them back on she started saying that Sarah took her glasses. 

I called Sarah downstairs and she admitted that she did take the glasses. We were all disappointed but Eleanor and Paul proceeded to tear into her about how cruel and nasty she was and how frightened and upset Becky was because of her. 

Sarah tried to explain that Becky had been taunting her about the photos and had been saying that she would be cropped out, but Becky's parents had no sympathy and said that maybe a ''bully'' like Sarah deserves that. I went ballistic and said that Becky had been bullying Sarah for years and they have laughed it off. Paul tried to say that Becky's ''girly teasing'' wasn't bullying and that what Sarah did was. 

I can see why Eleanor wants Sarah punished, but at the same time her daughter was the instigator and I don't agree with her wanting to punish our daughter after hers inflicted years of psychological abuse on her. We don't want to punishing Sarah. Obviously it was wrong to take the glasses, but it was a response to years of torment.

1,"AITA for telling my husband to “fuck off and leave?” | I am not a morning person. I have been grumpy in the morning my entire life. I do not want to talk about anything important or have any kind of small talk in the morning. I will answer yes or no questions, but that’s about it. My parents know this and we spent mornings together in silence growing up. My husband has known this since we met but refuses to accept it. He is incredibly perky in the morning and wants to talk about anything and everything. We both were working jobs where we set our start times. I purposely get up and out of the house before he’s awake to avoid him and his cheery-ness and prevent any unnecessary fights because I know I’ll be fine in a little bit. 

I’m off today but was woken up at 6:15 by our one year old. Great, that’s when he gets ready for work 😕 So he tries talking to me, I don’t even remember at this point what it was about. But I gave my short answers that he thinks is rude and that warrants a conversation about how I am in the morning. I said something about I’m not a morning person and you’ve known this for four years. But that’s not good enough for him so I get told that I “don’t get to talk to [him] this way.” And he decides this is the time to talk about how I need to change who I am in the morning. So I said “Fuck off and leave” because that is the worst time for me to have any kind of serious conversation. He again told me I don’t get to talk to him that way and has continued texting me all morning from work about how my behavior is unacceptable. And, even though I’ve sent him articles explaining the concept of “not a morning person,” he continues to tell me it’s not okay and needs to change. I think he’s the asshole for not accepting something because it’s different than his ways and telling me I have to change. He thinks I’m as asshole for how I speak to him in the morning.

 I don't blame him as most of the arguments and fights where started by my mom on little things.

* I didn't even want to spend $1k on a new laptop, yet this one dinner will basically mean my laptop budget's out the door

1,"AITA for saying that my cousin’s girlfriend’s boobs defy gravity? | 18M here. My cousin 19M and I are best buddies. We hang out all time. His girlfriend Annie 19F and I are friends too. We’ve been doing a lot of outdoor activities recently. Yesterday, the three of us and a mutual friend 18M trekked a mountainous area. While we were trekking, we got to talking about Michael Jordan. Our friend made a comment about Jordan looking like he could defy gravity when he dunks or do whatever wizardry only he could do. I followed that up by saying “Annie’s tits also defy gravity.” No one laughed. 


Here’s some necessary background. Annie was flat as a board a year ago. She got tastefully-sized implants. They’re super round and look like two tennis balls glued to her chest. Plus, she doesn’t hesitate to show them off. Like yesterday, she was wearing a drop armhole tank top with no visible bra showing. Thus, you could see much of her side boobs clear as day, even the minor signs of rippling. I’m pretty sure she was wearing one of those stick on bra thingies. I don’t objectify women. I support the female empowerment of getting breast augmentation and dressing the way she does around men. 


I don’t recall ever making an unprovoked comment about her breasts with her within earshot. This must have been the first time. I was already thinking about how perky and gravity-defying her breasts were since I saw her roll up in that outfit, but it was in the back of my mind. What I said slipped out of my mouth partially because I didn’t see it as that big of an issue. Which girl wouldn’t want gravity-defying breasts that don’t need heavy duty sports bras to restrain them during strenuous exercise? Plus, Annie usually doesn’t take banter too seriously. 


Back to the story we go. Annie glared at me and said “excuse me?”, and not in a lighthearted tone. I told her to please excuse my potty mouth because I really didn’t mean to offend her if I did. She asked me if it felt awesome to say such a childish thing about her boobs. I told her that she should know by now that I’m not the type of guy to objectify women and it was just an incredibly dumb blip that is in no way a reflection of my true character. She told me to just own what I said, apologize, and stop making a fool out of myself. I said I was very sorry and asked for her forgiveness. She said she’ll try. 


My cousin and our friend were virtually silent throughout that altercation. Annie was laughing and responding normally to those two guys, but whenever I said something that was funny, she wouldn’t laugh, while the two guys did. I had to address her directly to get a word out of her mouth. It made for a quite uncomfortable expedition when this was supposed to be a chill day to exercise, explore, and de-stress.

0,"AITA for not wanting to help out my dad and his wife? | Throw away account for reasons.

Some background information:

About 6 years ago, my dad had an affair with another woman which ultimately led to my parents separation. He impregnated his mistress, and eventually got married. Our relationship has been rocky ever since.

My dad seems to be the primary taker of his child (now 4 y/o) due to her mother working long hours nearly everyday. Although I have a rocky relationship with my dad, I still spend time with my younger half sister and treat her no different as any of my other siblings. Recently, my dad reached out to me in need of help to watch younger half sister while he goes on vacation for 3 weeks. Unfortunately, the time he's leaving falls around the time of my busiest school quarter, and then Spring break- which puts me in a situation where I'd have to sacrifice pretty much all of my spare time to watch half sister. I usually wouldn't mind, however, my dad has failed to ask half sisters mom to sacrifice any of her time in order to take care of her own child. She refuses to take time off work, or even work fewer hours, and insists I take their child for nearly 13 hours each day in order for her to get sleep and feel energized for work. I feel this is completely unfair to not only me, but their child as well, who is put at the butt of both their priorities. I told both dad and half sister's mom I would only be available 4 times out of the week to baby sit (which is nearly everyday) and received hateful comments about my inability to reciprocate any kind of help my dad has given me throughout the years. Although I feel bad about not being more of help to both of them, I can't help but feel like I deserve to put aside some time for myself in between working and going to school full time, instead of sacrificing nearly every second of free time to watch my half sister while her dad goes on vacation and her mom spends all her time working. So, AMITA?

1,"AITA for refusing to go to my sister's wedding? | Am I (28M) the asshole for not wanting to go to my sister's (24F) wedding and ending a friendship with my best friend (29M)? 

So here's some backstory: Me and my best friend have been friends since middle school. We were like brothers and we used to hang out every day. He's a good guy but I recently found out he has been dating my younger sister behind my back. I didn't know until now. It was only when my sister announced they were going to get married I knew what was going on. Apparently, they have been dating for many years and engaged for 14 months without telling anyone.

Fast forward to today, and my sister announces she's going to get married and the wedding is next week. She invited her whole family to the wedding. I thought maybe she had been secretly dating someone maybe that's why she suddenly is going to get married. And maybe she hid it from me as she knew I would disapprove as I'm overprotective? My sister is the type of girl every guy wants (blonde hair, blue eyes and she's very pretty and has big boobs). A lot of guys hit on her and I'm afraid someone will use her or hurt her so that's why I'm overprotective. But I guess she's going to get married anyway so there's nothing I can do other than to congratulate her. However, the next thing she said shocked me: Her fiance is my best friend. Apparently, they started dating in 2014 and got engaged around Christmas 2018. After hearing this, I felt betrayed and angry. I'm disappointed in both her and my best friend, especially my best friend. No one fucks their best friend's little sister. Nobody does shit like that. To make matters even worse, they hid their relationship from me and my family for 6 years. I'm going to end the friendship with my best friend (a.k.a. future brother-in-law) for being a backstabbing piece of shit. I'm done with him.  

Anyway, I told my sister that I won't go to her wedding or want to have anything to do with her soon-to-be husband and she freaked out. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and give her away (our father died three years ago and I'm her only sibling). But there is no way I'll go to her wedding. I mean my best friend is going to be my brother-in-law? It just feels too weird. So I told her to either walk down the aisle alone or find someone else to do the honor. Well, my sister started crying and begging me to come to her wedding. She says she wants my blessing. But she will never get it because I will never approve of her marriage.

We then talked with our mother and she said I'm being selfish. She also said that I should go to my sister's wedding. But I said it's my choice whether I'm going or not and no one can force me. However, my sister says I'm a horrible brother and that I hurt her feelings. I know it's her special day but I really don't want to see her fiance again.

1,"AITA for asking my GF to come home after working an event in the city? | Gf (39F) and I (35M) have been together for about a year and a half. We live apart and spend nights together when we can. Unfortunately, we end up spending most nights apart. We have both said we don't like this. However, being busy professionals, we deal with it.

GF got a new job in the spring as a project manager for a shipping association. She's been putting together industry events, organizing tours for various ships, etc. These events almost always occur away from our home city. Some of them are quite far away (travel by plane), but others have been in driving distance (around an hour).

On the occasion that the event has been closer, I've asked if she could consider staying at home or if I could drive up and stay with her. She's always refused. Her reasoning is that she's going to be way too busy with work, and will just be crashing at the hotel (or place she's staying).

Recently, an event she was organising came up in our city. Two weeks before it, she let me know that she would be staying at the event site. I asked her why, as the city transit goes there, and all together we're talking maybe 30-35 minutes door to door. I got the usual response. I asked if I could come and stay with her, she said no. I dug further and asked about the plans in the evening. The first night she says she'll be working late setting up, but then her portion will finish, so she doesnt need to worry about tear down. I ask her why is she staying there for an additional two nights, then? It comes out there are social events those nights. Events I'm not invited to. I say fine, doesn't feel great, but then can she please just come back home after the parties rather than stay at the site? She says no, she has to be back at the event in the mornings.

I got upset.

I pointed out it takes longer for me to get to work from her apartment than it would for her to get to the event, and yet I do this all the time. I pointed out that none of this is a reason I couldn't come stay with her. I pointed out she could just leave the social portion before it was 2AM and get a good night's sleep if she wanted. I pointed out we dont spend that much time together as is. I pointed out I am NEVER (not an exaggeration) invited to anything to do with her new job, when I am very conscientious to invite her to everything in the hopes she'll make it.

Her response was to question why I can't just support her, and that this is what she feels she needs to be successful. I told her I would like to support her but these decisions seem less about work and more about socializing and convenience and they don't make me feel valued in the relationship. I told her she needs to be more open to compromise.

0,"WIBTA if I didn't give my cousin the money from her graduation gift | I bought my little cousin a very nice and very generous piece of jewelry for her high school graduation a few weeks ago. Our grandmother recently passed away, and had given me, as well as my sisters, the same item (a watch) for our high school graduations. So in my grandma's absence I gave her the watch, a simple and classic style Movado that set me back \~$500USD. It was significantly more than I have ever spent on a gift, but felt that this was an important occasion and this tradition was important in my family. 

&#x200B;

About a week ago I'm checking my online banking, and I notice a chargeback on my card from the store for the full amount of the deposit (I financed the watch and would be making payments). Thinking it was a mistake, I called them and asked to speak to the manager. Wellll..... It turns out my cousin came in the very next day and returned the watch. The manager also added that the greeting card I had given with it was still in the bag and my cousin had left it behind asking if we wanted that back.

&#x200B;

I felt so hurt. I didn't even know what to say. I felt hurt that she couldn't be honest with me about how she felt, I felt hurt she clearly didn't value my generosity, I felt hurt that she returned the item the next day.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to yesterday: My aunt calls me up. She explains that my cousin had returned the watch as she felt uncomfortable with how much I had spent on her, and felt that she had no need for such a nice piece on jewelry in college. I said I was hurt but that I understood. My aunt proceeded to say that, however, she has a lot of things she needs like new clothes and dorm stuff and she could really use the money. She proceeds to say that she's talked to my cousin and it would be great if I could just Venmo her all of the money I spent on the watch.

&#x200B;

I was so floored. If I had wanted to give her a cash gift I would have, but the only reason I spent that much money is because my sisters and I have all gotten that same watch from our Grandma and I didn't want her to feel hurt or left out. I thought it would be a nice surprise, but it was a lot for me and I had financed it, and it would be really financially uncomfortable for me to cough up such a large amount of money in one month. I let her know this.

&#x200B;

I told all of that to my Aunt, and she proceeds to call me an Indian Giver and say that's disgusting, that I can't just not give my cousin a gift because she didn't want the watch, that I was ridiculous to give such an expensive piece of jewelry to a teenager, and that I should be proud of her for being responsible enough to want to spend the money on things that are more practical for her in this stage of her life. She said that it was incredibly tacky and selfish to get her so excited like this but then change my mind.

1,"AITA for not taking care of my daughter and persuading everyone else in the family to not care of her either after her boob job that I made clear I didn’t support? | My daughter (20) got a boob job two weeks ago and paid for it with her own money. I made it clear from the get go that I didn’t support the mutilation of her body and the financial aspect of it because her parents still pay for her college expenses. I also made it clear that I wouldn’t take care of her with any post-surgery related issues. She came back home for a month-long semester break. She got the boob job immediately. I wasn’t busy on her surgery day but I didn’t want to drive her to and from the clinic. I persuaded my husband and sons not to either. So her friend drove her to and from the clinic. 


She was all loopy when she came back but I persuaded everyone to let her be on her own. My daughter called me for help to bathe and change, but I made it clear once again that she’s on her own. She threw a fit and called me a terrible mother. My husband thinks I’m being unnecessarily harsh but I’m firm in my stance that she made an adult decision and needs to learn how to cope with the aftermath herself like an adult. I still did laundry and cooked for her, but I didn’t spoon feed her and persuaded everyone else not to either when she said it hurts to lift her arms. 


We were at a family gathering two days ago. People were talking about my daughter’s boob job and the recovery phase. My daughter told everyone that I didn’t help her at all with anything. I explained my position on this issue like I have already done in this post, but every one of them still said a good mother would take care of her daughter even if she didn’t support the boob job. I didn’t agree but I woke up today to a slight feeling of guilt and doubt that I might have been too harsh on her these past two weeks, but I’m not entirely sure that feeling is valid.",False,False

0,"WIBTA if I quit my hospitality job the week before Christmas? | This is my first ever post so I’m sorry if I’ve got anything wrong! 

I have been working as a restaurant manager for over 10 years but in September this year started at a new place as a deputy manager to take a step back from the stress of being the general manager. My last general manager job caused me to end up in a deep depression & so I thought I’d be better off as a deputy.

Turns out I was wrong. My job started off great with a promise of having at least 2 evenings a week free, one night so I could play my sport (which helps keep my mental health in check) & I helped the GM with all the rotas & was given lots of praise for the job I have been doing. Recently I haven’t been getting any evenings off in the week, my shift patterns are usually 3-close, 12-10 or 12-close, meaning I’m only free to do anything else on my days off (i.e. see friends, see my boyfriend, see my family, Christmas shopping, tidy the house etc) & worst of all I have been put to work on the days I play my sport, my team aren’t particularly happy with me! 

On top of that my general manager is an AH. He never says hello as we come in, he never thanks anyone for their hard work even though all our reviews have been amazing, he constantly is moaning or telling people off for things that most of the time aren’t even wrong, they’re just not his way (his way changes every week we will never get it right) & people are now fearful of coming to work as they know they will be shouted at as soon as they walk through the door.

Only recently have I managed to end up in his bad books (reasons unknown I have been doing my job the same way since the start). He has undermined me on the rotas, twice now after I spent hours of my time doing them he has then scribbled them out in front of my face & said I have been too nice to staff so he will re-do them. I accepted I would be working all over Christmas because I know the industry but asked if I could maybe not do the whole day Christmas Eve or start a little later on Christmas Day to spend a small amount of time with my family, instead he actually extended my shifts from what I had suggested they could be. He also extended some of my other shifts that week meaning I was working all day on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day & the 2 days after that as well, no time to see my family or my heavily pregnant sister who would be visiting. 

I could go on forever about the things he has done to me lately but long story short, I’m now having daily panic attacks about going to work & have had to return to my GP for help with my depression. Both the GP & my parents think the job is not worth my happiness but I know the staff (who I think are all great btw it’s just the manager who isn’t) will be short over Christmas without me & the GM may have to cancel his holiday he has booked from Boxing Day.

0,"AITA (24M) for not talking to my coworker (19F) until she apologizes to me? | Obligatory apology for formatting on mobile, typos, and grammar. Also, I’m at work so it may not be cohesive at times. TL;DR at the bottom

So, I work in a restaurant. I would like to think I’m a pretty hard worker who helps out everyone no matter the circumstances. I’ve been in management as well, so I understand how to deal with customers and coworkers alike.

Yesterday, I had a table of 5. The ladies were extremely nice, but they required a bit more attention than a typical table. I wasn’t worried about accommodating them since they were very pleasant despite their constant requests. Two of the ladies sent their food back because it wasn’t what they were expecting. When their new orders came out, a different server ran the food. Up until this point, I was the only server to touch the table. 

When I returned to check on them, they were pissed. They said the other server had an attitude and threw their food at them. I didn’t see anything, but I got the manager who then spoke to them. After speaking with her about it in the back, she came out laughing which angered my table even more. They were so pissed that they didn’t want to finish their food and that prompted them to demand to speak to the GM. She continued to laugh while all of this was happening. He comped all of their food and as a result, they didn’t leave me a tip. 

Obviously, that pissed me off because I wasn’t the one who antagonized them and I worked extremely hard to make sure they were taken care of. They told my GM that I did a great job and them still not tipping is a different issue. However, I’d like to think that they would have if things did not go awry. After they left, another server asked why was she laughing. Her words were, “I thought it was a funny situation.” She kept saying she didn’t care and didn’t say anything to me until she left. I spent the rest of the day silently seething. Now, I’m not really the type to hold grudges. After I told my manager why it pissed me off, I went home and let it go. However, the fact that I lost money because of it makes me not want to talk to her.

Today, I‘m doing my usual thing. I ran some of her food, bussed down a couple of her tables when I had time. I’m just not interested in talking to her until she apologizes to me. One of my coworkers asked why I haven’t said anything to her, and I remained silent about it. I don’t want to add more fuel by talking shit behind her back. A mutual friend/coworker said that I’m being petty and that I should just talk to her, but I’m confused since I didn’t do anything wrong.

0,"AITA for ignoring my mother who married my former classmate? | When I was 12, my father passed away from a decade long on and off battle with brain cancer. I have three younger siblings, 2 sisters and a brother. Life sucked for the next few years after his death but our mother did an amazing job of raising all 4 kids on her own. 

Fast forward to high school, I had found a solid group of friends and we would often party at each other’s houses. It was never anything too hard, maybe a few beers, but never anything much more. My mom has always been super chill, so our get togethers were often held at my place.

Eventually, word got around that we had a spacious backyard and it became the hot spot for high school partying. People beyond my general friend group were showing up to our parties. It was at this point that my mother met ‘Adam’. Adam was always a year ahead of me in high school (he graduated in ‘15, I graduated in ‘16). I had spoken to him before on few occasions but only considered him a mutual acquaintance.

One night, he and my mom got into a deep conversation and they apparently exchanged phone numbers. He moved away after he graduated to attend university, but they continued to secretly text one another. One night, my mother confessed all of this to me and told me that Adam was planning to move back after his freshmen year of college so that he could be closer to her. He would transfer to a closer university and finish his degree there. 

A few months later, I graduated and moved out of state to attend university myself. Adam indeed moved back to be closer to my mother and they announced they were officially dating. I was just ready to get the hell away from home at this point and not have to deal with what I figured was going to be a ‘fuck buddy’ ordeal. 

Angry at my mother, I decided to stop talking to her once I moved away. I would ignore her phone calls and simply respond with a short text to assure her everything was good. Eventually, she stopped calling and the only time we would connect was through the occasional text message.

Two years later, Adam proposed to my mother. I keep in often touch with my younger siblings. They are now 18, 16, & 13 and keep me somewhat updated on their lives and our mothers relationship. They were all very disturbed by the relationship initially, but they’ve all seemed to have been brainwashed to jump on board with it. My sisters claim he’s a good guy who truly loves our mom. My brother is a bit more doubtful but he still seems to be generally accepting of it. I’ve tried telling them that it’s not a healthy relationship but they always brush me off, telling me they don’t want to anger or upset our mom. 

Long story short, they got married last month. My 46 year old mother is now the wife on my 22 year old former high school classmate. I did not attend the wedding and I have not spoken to her since September of 2016.",False,False

This time, my sister wants a circus themed party for the 5th birthday party in March (early, but we have to start booking stuff now). At the place we have it at, it gets decorated with the theme and there are a couple of people who dress up for the theme and come entertainment, and there is a cake, and a huge indoor play centre for the kids. Costs a few hundred dollars, which is out of reach for her, but I can afford it. I don't want my own kids but love being a spoiling aunty. 

I said I am fine with anything but a circus theme with people dressed up as clowns.

I'm one of those people who despite being a grown ass adult woman is *terrified* of clowns. Like, I will just want to run away and *hide* if there are people dressed up as clowns there. 

I said I will pay for literally any other theme than a circus/clown theme. 

My sister said I am being totally unreasonable and trying to ""dictate Carolina's preferences and deny what Carolina wants in favour of something she doesn't want to meet your own preferences"". I disagree. 

Carolina will still get a birthday party she will love and be happy with. There are lots of other themes we can choose from that she'd adore such as Frozen, Tangled, Hello Kitty, Minnie Mouse, Angelina Ballerina, etc. I'm not vetoing literally the one thing she would like.

My father had health problems for the last few years and he recently succumbed to them.. During this time my brother had gotten married and was on his honeymoon.

I made the choice to be the one to inform my brother of the news. Our mother died years ago, so I am the only one left in our family that's closest to him. I told any other distant family members to refrain from letting him know until I say it's okay.

I decided in all fairness, that he should get to enjoy his honeymoon with his new wife, and I decided not to tell him until he gets back.

We had a few gatherings and then the funeral happened. Some people were wondering why my brother wasn't there and I explained the situation that he is on his honeymoon. A few people thought it was the right thing to let him enjoy it, others thought I should have told my brother, so I guess that is where the divide began.

A few days after the funeral my brother came out and I quickly texted him that our father died. He almost immediately called me up and was freaking out, understandably. I expected he would be surprised, but he sounded flabbergasted as if our father had no health problems prior to his death. I told him that this was going to happen eventually.

He asked when the funeral would be and I explained to him that we already had it and then he started screaming at me on the phone and cursing at me. I hung up on him until he could calm down.

The entire table was silent and watching me chew and I felt so awkward right after I did it.  She looked at me with daggers in her eyes and put her fork and knife down and said, ""You know, I really hate when people eat off my plate.""  

I tried to make a joke out of it and lighten the mood by making kissy noises, but she wouldn't have any of it.  She looked disgusted with one eyebrow raised shaking her head, and made more snide comments, like she was really irritated with what I did.  While I never apologized to her, I didn't think my action warranted her strong reaction, especially since I was open to sharing my food with her.

When it was time to leave the restaurant, she boxed up her uneaten food and the one remaining plantain in a doggy bag.  Weird.  Why wouldn't she lighten up since she wasn't eating it anyway?

Later on that same evening, we all went out to get ice cream and everyone was discussing what flavors they were going to get.  She already ordered and was eating, so I was going to ask her what flavors she got, but before I could say anything, she moved away from me and said, ""Don't touch my ice cream.""  

I don't understand how a playful girl could turn so hostile toward me.  Was I an asshole in this situation?",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting to be the house maid and cook during Thanksgiving? | When I was a child, my mom did all the cooking including an elaborate Thanksgiving meal with all the fixings including a couple kinds of pies and other desserts. There were upwards of 25 of us at times. We all loved it and looked forward to an amazing meal together. Then I became the mom. I have done the same for my family over the years because that is all I ever saw, but to be truthful, I have become resentful. The planning begins in advance of the day. Figuring out who will be here and what to cook then shopping for groceries etc. Then comes the day of cooking. Literally no one hangs out in the kitchen to keep me company.  It also makes me feel horrible that my mom did this for so many years and I had no idea what she put out to do all of that by herself.  The day just really sucks for me. My husband will help clean up after. “His contribution” he says, but it just all feels very cold and disconnected. I have talked to him about it but he always just dismisses me like it is my problem. Today he said he felt sorry for his friend (a man and father), who was cooking alone.  When I challenged what he said, and asked why he would feel sorry for him when I do it every year by myself, he just mumbled something about the guy’s family working or something as to why he HAD to cook. WTH! AITA for not wanting to do this anymore? How do I change this dynamic so I can survive another season?",False,False
1,"AITA for refusing to go to my sponsor’s funeral because he died of a relapse and overdose? | I’m 28 and I owe much of my three years sober to my sponsor, Duane. He helped bring me back from the edge of many almost-relapses and basically became like a father to me after my own family didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. 

He’s helped me with my relationships, with navigating my new career and getting back on my feet. I met his wife who also appreciated the friendship we had outside of a sponsor context. 

I didn’t even know that Duane had been having a rough time lately with his addiction. He was sober for 21 years.

I got a call last week that Duane’s body had been found and his wife told me it was an accidental overdose.

The funeral is being held this weekend. I received an invitation from her yesterday.

The thing is, I don’t plan to go. I can’t square the sober man who helped me with the man who died of an overdose in his car in a parking lot. I almost feel betrayed by him, like I didn’t really know him at all. If he had died of any other reason, I think I could go, but not when this is how it happened. 

I told his wife that due to the circumstances of his death, I didn’t think I would be attending the funeral.

She seemed upset but understood.

I feel like I made the right choice, but with Duane gone, I don’t have very many people to talk to anymore about this especially. 

So, AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for not giving my friend a ride | So my friend does not have his license or car, he recently accepted a seasonal job 45 minutes away from where he lives and didn’t want to spend a shit ton on Uber or taxis. 

Enter me, I’m an EMT that works graveyards so 9pm-7am, he begged me to get him to and from work at 9 am every morning and 4 pm every night.... for $30 a week.  I live in the same neighborhood as him and my work is 30 minutes the opposite direction, so it would consist of me driving 30 minutes to work, spending most of my shift driving or in a vehicle, driving 30 minutes home, then driving him 45 minutes out to his job... in rush hour... then picking him up at 4 pm... in rush hour.... for $30 a week.


I originally agreed but soon discovered it would just be too much for me and tried to help him find other options, he would not take no for an answer and was constantly begged. I’m a pretty easy pushover so I kept with it until one day last week I busted my butt to get to his place and he had already gotten another ride, without thinking so much to give me the heads up. I haven’t spoken to him since. 

So am I the asshole for not giving him a ride?",False,False
0,"AITA for refusing to drive my autistic sister to work anymore? | I (25 M) got into an argument with my mother today because I'm refusing to drive my sister to work anymore. 

About 5 months ago I got my sister a job working with me. I know they say not to work with family but my sister is 19 and is high functioning autistic. I work with animals and my boss and I thought it would be good for her. Since then she's graduated high school, came our of her shell, and started handling grown things. She has her own bank account and handles her own money. The autistic part is more so her social and learning skills.

Everyday I clock out for 30 minutes to go get her and bring her to work. At first is wasnt an issue but its causing strife at work. I get a 30 minute break and then get another 30 minutes to go get my sister. At work we are not siblings, we are co workers. We dont treat each other as siblings and she doesn't get any special treatment.

I have a scooter that needs fixed. Just an oil change and a new starter relay. I did the math and I'm losing $1680 a year at minimum by getting my sister so I suggested to my mom that she fixes the scooter and drives to work. It's all back roads and is only a 10 minute ride. My mother said it's not going to happen. ""Riding a scooter is dangerous and how will someone with anxiety handle that."" I told her she needs to stop sheltering her and get her ready for the real world.

It ended up in a huge argument because she doesn't feel she can do it but I feel like it's not my responsibility to get her to work every day. It upsets my coworkers. I wouldn't leave every day to get a coworker like that, why do I need to do it for her.

I gave my mom an ultimatum last night. Told her my sister can either fix the scooter and I'll take her to work until she can get it running or monday when she gets paid shell have to uber, take the bus, or the town club car to get to work. I will not take her anymore. My mother tells me I need to stop being an asshole and get the d*ck out of my ass. Shes my sister and my responsibility. My sister hears all this and is completely against it too and I cant help but feel it's because my mother puts her down so fast.

I cant help but feel it's not my responsibility. My mom wont be here forever and I'm not going to take care of my sister forever.  She has money saved and is capable of fixing it. She can handle having a stable job, managing money, in my mind this is the next step to her self reliance. Am I really the asshole in the situation? The scooter sounds the most realistic to me. An uber would cost her $2600 a year at the least as opposed to a hundred or more to fix a scooter.",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I sold my husbands custom motorcycle while he's deployed overseas? | Much more to this than the title, of course. My husband loves motorcycles and while he is an incredible artist building them, he is terrible at riding them. He has had 8 crashes in 4 years. He's kept most of them under the radar but the last two have been serious. He had a massive concussion and had to be med boarded (where the military decides if you are fit to serve) and one day after he was cleared to stay in the service, he crashed into a hotel courtesy van. I think insurance paid out almost 3 million dollars because the van was full and there were injuries. 

He is essentially no longer insurable on the motorcycle, his commander has told him that he is absolutely not allowed to ride motorcycles any more and if he's caught he will be article-15 or even court martialed for disobeying a direct order. My husband wants to keep the bike until he retires but even then, I say enough is enough. 

We live in Vegas so I have contacted a very famous custom bike and car shop and they are willing to buy the bike in its damaged condition for more money than my husband has put into it. Husband leaves for Qatar on Sunday, I want to be at this shop on Monday and sell the bike.

Would I be the asshole if I sold the motorcycle?",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting to give my child a long complicated Hawaiian name? | I was born and raised in Hawaii but I'm white. My girlfriend is native Hawaiian who is very involved in native culture. She's pregnant. We are very happy with that. However my girlfriend is insisting on giving our daughter a long Hawaiian name. In Hawaiian culture names are very important and apparently children are usually named by the elders in the community and their names have meaning. She says she's fine with giving our daughter a ""simple"" first name but the middle name has to be what her grandmother wants which is Keānuenueokalani.  Apparently she had it in a dream or something. This is really important to her but I just can't give my kid a name that I literally cannot pronounce (and neither can anyone in my family) I've offered ""simpler"" Hawaiian names but she says it has to be what her grandmother wants and it's a ""beautiful name"" and I need to respect her culture on this. I think this this is all a bit ridiculous. My sister thinks I'm being dumb and making a big deal about a middle name when she's going to go by her first name anyway. I  think that I'm just as much the parents as my girlfriend and I should have some input on the name. 

AITA here?",False,False
1,"AITA for waking up the neighbors with their own Bluetooth speaker after they woke me up the night before? | I want judgement from this subreddit because, on many occasions, I have been too defensive in disputes that others would just try to ignore. I'll apologize to the neighbors if that was the case here. Thanks.

We live in a building with three units. The one below us is vacant, and the one above me houses a very unpleasant couple. (I include those two details to show there were no other victims of my behavior.) They are horrible neighbors who possibly have a personal vendetta against us.

Late one night we woke up to a knock at our door. It was a cop. Apparently, the neighbors had accused us of breaking into their car. He asked me a few questions about what we were doing and our relationship with the neighbors. The conversation was less than like 2 minutes. At the end he basically said ""we don't have the resources to deal with this shit at this hour, but don't hesitate to call us if it escalates to violence"" and left.

I was pretty upset at what they did. They interrupted my sleep *and* they wasted emergency services time. So the next night, I stayed up to around the same hour. I connected my phone to their unprotected Bluetooth speaker. I got some extreme-bass rap music on YouTube. And I turned the volume up as high as it could go. After they disabled the speaker I heard them yelling at each other.",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting to buy an engagement ring? Help! | Sorry for the throwaway, don't want my school friends to see this on my account. I'll try to keep this short. I've been with my gf for 7 years. Yesterday, after talking about it, we decided that we want to get married. Woot! Engaged! Done.

Now, I always thought that people who go out and spend $10k, $15k, $20k on an engagement rings were either just stupid, rich, or stupidly rich. I guess I never really saw myself as the type of guy who would buy an expensive ring, hire a flashmob, and do some overly-grand proposal. But it seems like that is exactly what my gf expected. Actually, she already had some rings picked out.

I have money. I could go out and buy a $20k ring today, no problem. But, I just don't see the point. I see it as a waste of money. I have some very specific financial goals in my life and spending that much on a ring just isn't in-line with those goals. I'm not cheap - I just don't go out blowing all my cash on material things which don't add value to my life. 

Anyway, we have discussed marriage/weddings before and are in 100% agreement about how much (not) to spend, how it's going to be, who will be invited, etc. I though that, as adults, we could have a conversation, make the decision to get married, and then proceed from there. So yesterday, when she asked if I was going to do a ""traditional proposal"", I told her that didn't think it was necessary. 

...that's when all the drama started. She ended up showing me the rings she had picked out, told me that she pretty much expected one, and didn't understand why I didn't want to buy her one. They are all $10-17k. I asked if, instead an engagement ring, we could just pick out wedding bands together and skip this step. After a little while, she told me that she ""could do one for maybe $6k"" if I insisted. At that point, I ended the conversation. It felt slimy, like she expects payment for an engagement. And then she said that the engagement is ""on hold"" until we figure this out.

I asked my close friends and they all think that I should just buy her a ring because ""that's just what you do"" and I ""have to make her happy"". Ok so, she is only happy if I buy her something? Idk, I'm conflicted here. AITA in this situation???",False,False
1,"AITA for telling my waitress's manager she did a great job? | Not a clickbait title, that's actually what happened. I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.

I met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)

Our waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.

At the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.

The only one not happy was my date. She said, ""If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't."" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.

1,"AITA for ""taking"" a disabled students seat? | I'm currently taking a class at my local college.  The class is MWF but last Monday was a holiday so the first day of class was last Wednesday.  I attended the first day of class but it was packed so I had to stand in the back.  Then I missed the Friday lecture as well as the Monday lecture.  Today, Wednesday, was my 1st day back. I knew the class was packed so I came 10 min early to get a seat in the front row.  I prefer to sit in the front row because I have anxiety.  By sitting in the front I'm able to ask questions/answer questions without being forced to shout it across the room.  I'm perfectly capable of doing well in a course if I'm forced to sit in the back...this is just a strong preference.

All seats are first come, first served.  There are 2 seats in each class called ""priority seats"" specifically designated for the disabled that are only open to abled students when they're unoccupied.  You have to notify the school, then the professor makes sure that seat is available to you every lecture. For the abled seats, after a few weeks people always tend to sit in the same seats and you get the impression that its your ""seat"" that you sit in for the rest of the semester even though its technically not.  After I sit down I notice 2 girls walk in together talking and laughing.  One girl sits in the seat behind me and the other girl stands next to me and says:

Girl 1: Hi, sorry, actually you're sitting in my seat.

Me: There is no assigned seating.  Anyone can sit anywhere.

Girl 1: Yeah but I've been sitting in this seat all semester (this is our 3rd lecture out of like 30). There are still open seats in the back that you can move to.

Me: Which means there are also open seats in the back that you can sit in too, right?

Girl 1: Look...I'm deaf in 1 ear. I need a seat in the front row.  Move please. (I saw her hearing aid)

Me: Then you'd be registered with the disabled students department and they would have made sure you had priority seating. This isn't a priority seat.

Girl 1: I don't need to register anything with the school and I dont need to explain myself to you.  Its my seat...I told you I need it because I'm hard of hearing.

Me: Wouldn't those same rules apply to me as well? Not needing to explain myself to you?

Girl 2: Stop being an asshole and just fucking move...jesus.

Me: I'm done talking. I'm not moving.

Girl 1 and Girl 2: \*\*scoffs\*\*

Girl 1: \*\*finds another seat\*\*

I don't feel like I did anything wrong, but I damn sure spent the rest of class overhearing everyone behind me talking shit about me. It's important to point out that we're always given worksheets that we can work on with the person behind us...so its possible Girl 1 mostly wanted my seat so she could work with Girl 2 on it.  Also, I was in the front seat in the far left corner. There are about 10 seats closer to the middle board than the seat I was in.",False,False
0,"AITA for not volunteering for a seminar when I was sick so my colleague could be with her new puppy? | I recently came down with a cold and was away from work for one day. I made it in the following morning but was still not well. My manager indicated that he had intended to send me to a nearby office for a seminar of some sort the next day but upon realising I was sick (he had not been in the office the day before), suggested he would send my colleague instead. I suggested to my manager that this would be best as I was not sure if I could commit to the seminar as I was still unwell. 

At this point in time, I was aware that my colleague had gotten a new puppy the day before but was not aware of any working from home arrangement that her team leader (different person to my direct manager) had agreed to. I think it's worth noting also that we are a team of 10 so there were others who could have gone to the seminar instead of the two of us. It's unclear why my manager was insistent on her attending in my place.

Cue Wednesday, I'm feeling a little better than the day before but still not great. My colleague gets to work and when she sees me is visibly upset. She did not want to speak to me about it which made me believe she was upset about leaving the puppy at home and blamed me (we are usually quite close/open with each other). 

As I was feeling somewhat better, I was prepared to go to the seminar in my colleague's place so she could go home to her puppy. Her team leader had gone straight to the seminar so I didn't have an opportunity to speak to him about it, and I suspect my manager would not have allowed the switch anyway as I had quite a bit of work to catch up on after being sick.

After the seminar, my colleague was still visibly upset. I tried to apologise but she didn't want to hear it. I spoke to another colleague about it and she suggested that I had been a ""shitty friend"". This caught me off guard as I knew I had made a mistake but didn't think it was that big.

My colleague and I are now on speaking terms again but it feels awkward. She also (half) jokingly mentioned that I was #1 on her shit list temporarily for the whole thing which made me feel like a shitty person. I didn't go into how I felt about it all because it would only make things worse.

I am not great with social cues and can be naive about what is going on around me so I am genuinely not sure if what I did or didn't do was a dick move. Please help me Reddit - AITA here?

Note: I don't think my colleague is TA and I'm not even sure it's an ESH scenario. I am completely prepared to accept my judgement if I am TA.",False,False
0,"AITA For texting my friend how inappropriate her behavior was? | So last night, myself and a friend of mine had shows we directed and have been working on for about a month open, in the same theatre in repertory (my friend’s show was before mine). I was unable to actually see my own show as one of my cast members was violently ill and I took her place onstage. After the show, partially because I was unable to see it, I asked my friend and her boyfriend (both of whom are close friends of mine) what they thought of my show. They informed me that they were unable to pay attention to it because a mutual friend of ours was sitting next to them and talking to them through large parts of the show. Of course, it is theatre etiquette 101 not to talk while a show is happening, and I was pissed off since my friends were unable to watch my show because of uncorteous audience behavior. So I texted my mutual friend who talked for the entire show and told her that I was disappointed and kinda angry at her for talking through my show, informed her how sad I was that my friends were unable to watch my show due to her talking, and told her if she had no interest in seeing a show that she should simply not watch it instead of coming in and talking through the whole thing.

I guess it was a pain in the ass giving the cat its pills everyday, and its insulin shot. I essentially told her that they were treatable conditions, and that she should have kept trying. Her excuse was that the cat was 15 years old, and she gave it a good life, and it probably didnt have much time. She didnt know that though. I dont know how to feel about it.

0,"AITA - for having a go at my housemate over her dead cat’s poop? | So I have a housemate who is just terrible at adulting. Can’t clean up after herself, never does housework, never emptied the bins, cleaned dishes with her hands and is super irresponsible. She had a cat, which we discussed was not our responsibility to look after. However, she used to let the cat outside and then she would leave for several days, leaving the cat outside with no collar on it. The poor cat was so neglected. She also never cleaned the cat’s litter box. One night, after she’d let the cat outside and left for the next few days, the cat was hit by a car and didn’t come home. 

Now, before this happened, the litter box had been sitting filthy in the garage for three weeks. We’d mentioned it to her and she just wouldn’t empty it. We gave her a couple of weeks to grieve after the death but it was getting smelly. One morning, she posts some virtue signaling message in our group chat about another of my housemates thanking them for some trivial and standard cleaning. This prompted an (albeit sassy) response from me suggesting that maybe it would be good if we could all contribute because I’d noticed there was still cat poop that we’d asked her to clean in the garage after five weeks. She was upset at this and couldn’t believe I’d make such a comment about her given that the cat had died.

We showed up at the dinner and as far as I could tell all was good. 

The next day, I got a message from one of my friends saying he was annoyed I would bring my son without consulting anyone. That having a young adult there who has nothing in common with the rest of the party changed the dynamic and the topics we could discuss. He said others were upset as well.

 I didn’t invite some stranger. I invited my kid. I don’t see the problem. My son is polite and intelligent and I don’t see why bringing him would be an issue.

I usually throw on a Netflix show when i’m there alone with no issues. However, today I went during lunch hours and it was relatively busy. Both TVs were going on and I got on a machine and put on Netflix at a significantly lower volume than either of the TVs were on. The lady on the machine next to me shot me a few dirty glances before loudly stating to nobody in particular that it was rude to watch things on your phone without headphones, and I know for a fact that she was watching one of the TVs and had put the volume up before I had turned on my show.

He asked me out few times. I denied but he kept asking me over and over. I said that I’m trans, lied that I had a boyfriend. I straight up told him to leave me alone but he still doesn’t understand. I also talked to my brother about it and he just laughed it off and said it wasn’t a big deal.

So I have a dog. I asked for him when I was 6 and he’s my responsibility since that. I take care of him fully, he’s usually in my room. He’s a doberman so I guess he’s kinda scary looking. My brother’s friend is afraid of dogs, I always kept him in my room when he came over.

0,"AITA for telling my mom that she was wrong about money usage? | Ok so a bit of background: i live in a family of 4, mom and dad are divorced, i have a brother and a pomeranian dog, i am currently 21 YO. This happened 4 years ago but i still don't knowbif i blame myself or her. 


So my brother is 4 years older than me, graduated universety with a biology degree, traveled to London to pursue his education in Forensic science for a whole year and now is in the military.

My parents kept on sending him money by the loads (like 2000 pounds each 2 months) i asked them if its not too much and if there is going to be enough left for me to do my masters locally or abroad. They told me that yes they saved up a significant amount just for my education and nothing and no one will use for anything else. 


After my brother finished his masters and returned, i was closing in on finishing my liscence in management and ready to head directly in masters. But then my parents got devorced (wich costs us a shit load) and my mom wanted to move out. I decided to join her, we went and searched for a nice place, and nice neighborhood, we also went a chose the furniture (every single thing) and we payed and moved in. Little did i know that the money that my mom used was MY masters money. I was pissed off more than i think i will ever be. 


Now i need to tell you that my mom is the nicest person i know and she told me she feelt bad when purchasing the furnitures but didn't think i was good enough in university (my grades where averaged between 10/20 and 12/20) and went ahead and payed for them with the saved up load. 


Now my dad is paying the fee while i search for a job, i hate the place we are at because of this situation.

1,"AITA for saying I'd hate myself if I was a minimum wage worker? | I work as a 3D artist, I don't even make a lot, like 50k a year but I use to work as Cap 2 (stocking job) at Wal-Mart to make some income instead of sitting in my butt all day while I was looking for a new position and hated it. I was out with my friend shopping and we were having a conversation about work life and he said something about minimum wage and all I said is I would hate myself if I was working minimum wage.

One of the stockers overheard me and gave me this mean look. I didn't even mean to target minimum wage workers, I was actually referring to myself and my own standards so it wasn't meant as a personal attack or anything, I didn't even know the guy.

My friend understood what I meant but told me it wasn't the smartest idea to say that in that kind of work environment especially around an employee (didn't see him at first) but I feel like instead of concentrating on other people's conversation he should just work and mind his own business so that things like that don't happen.

0,"AITA for laying on my horn at people blocking the only entrance into my subdivision? | The entrance into my subdivision has giant signs saying “do not block intersection”. I live on the same road as the elementary school so everyday on my way to work or coming home parents line up and block the entrance. Not only is it dangerous it’s also illegal. If someone has an emergency and needs to leave or if an ambulance needs to come in, they’ll waste time. School gets out at 250pm and parents line up and block the intersection at 2:05 to 2:10. The issue got so bad the police had to make a Facebook post telling people to stop blocking the intersection. 

I let the issue slide for the past couple weeks. But the problem is getting worse. I cannot exit my subdivision and neither can the other homeowners. I started to lay on my horn to get them to move. Most people don’t care but a couple people flipped me off and refused to move. My horn isn’t ear piercingly loud.",False,False
0,"AITA for refusing legal advice to someone I barely know? | I (29F) am a lawyer and my field is real estate law and finance. My husband and I are looking to buy an apartment and we have been looking into some properties in the last few months. About 2 months ago, a coworker from my husband’s office told us that she had a friend that was selling an apartment in our favourite neighborhood in the city, so we called and went to visit the place. We actually liked it a lot but ultimately decided against the purchase since the asking price was way above our budget and the place needed a lot of work. We told the seller, she was nice about it and the thing was over really quickly. Yesterday I received a text from the seller (30ish F) saying “Hey, sorry to bother you, I know that we don’t know each other but I found a buyer for the house and I have a lot of questions regarding the legal aspects of the selling process. You mentioned in your visit that you’re a real estate lawyer, so I was wondering if you can give me your e-mail address so that I can send you a list of questions. Could you do me the favour of answering them as I don’t want to spend extra money on legal fees?”. I did not answer to the text and I don’t know how I should approach the issue, but I am actually pretty pissed off with the question. I would not hesitate to help without charge if it was a friend or even a minor acquaitance (I do this all the time). I earn a living by selling my time and expertise in the field and have no idea how she could think that I could waste maybe hours that I could otherwise be charging to help someone I have absolutely no connection with. I am tempted to respond that if she wants the help I can give her a fee quote. On the other hand, I am worried that she reacts badly and tells my husband’s coworker and that this puts a strain on their professional relationship. Any advice? AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting anything to do with my soon to be released from prison ""father""? | So I'm 16 years old, I grew up with my mom telling me my dad was working in another country and he was very busy so we couldn't visit him. I used to write him letters, send drawings, postcards and so on. I got letters and presents from him on my birthday and Christmas.

When I was 9 a mean cousin told me that my dad was in prison and I was the daughter of a criminal. I ran to my mother and he confirmed it, which shattered my world (on top of being bullied by my cousins). I stopped sending letters and threw away the letters and presents I got from him.  

A couple of years later I looked him up and learned that he was imprisoned for a robbery gone wrong, he and an accomplice were robbing a store, one of the patrons tried running away and they shot him in the back. They were lucky he didn't die, but still were given a hefty prison sentence. I realized that he had been in prison for longer than I had existed, so I went to my mom and she confirmed that I was conceived during a conjugal visit, which made things even worse for me.  

My mom has been in contact with him the whole time, and happily announced that he's due to be released in a couple months, and as her husband, he's going to come and live with us.  
I told her that I don't want to have anything to do with this man, I don't want to talk to him, interact with him in anyway or even look at him, I've never even talked to him in person, nor has he ever contributed to my life in any way, so I consider him a stranger, and a criminal one at that.  
My mom said tough luck, I'm living in her house rent free, still a minor and I have no say in all of this. So I asked around and I found an aunt willing to take me in and pay for my sustenance, just so I don't have to be near this guy.  

Now my mom is saying I'm an asshole for not giving him a chance, but I don't feel like I have to, he's a criminal, not a petty one but he tried to kill someone, and besides I was lied to for several years and only learned the truth because of someone else.

1,"AITA for telling my friend that it’s funny how his girlfriend is skinnier than mine but has much bigger boobs? | We’re all around 20 years old here. Yesterday 4 of us went to the beach. It was me, my girlfriend, my friend Gary, and Gary’s girlfriend Zoey. We go to the beach often so I already know what Zoey’s body looks like. I just never thought about commenting on it to Gary before. Well, yesterday we were in beach attire. The ladies wore bikinis. We all know that Zoey got breast implants when she was 18. She’s really skinny so her boobs look really big and fake. My girlfriend isn’t as skinny as Zoey and has small boobs. 


While my girlfriend and Zoey were chilling, Gary and I walked to a nearby store to buy something. As we walked back to the beach from the store, I didn’t think what I said next was a big deal. The thought popped into my brain because I noticed my girlfriend peeking at Zoey’s boobs a few times. I told Gary that it’s funny how his girlfriend is skinnier than mine but has much bigger boobs. He asked me how that’s funny. I asked him if he doesn’t find it funny how Zoey is like half the size of most other women on the beach but has bigger boobs than most. He said that he still failed to see how that’s funny. 


I told him that I have nothing against Zoey’s body, but it’s an extreme outlier. I told him I’m sure she’ll fit in better in LA or Miami than our redneck beach. He said that he knows Zoey is skinny and has fake boobs, but he still doesn’t find what I said funny. I told him funny might not be the right word, but interesting. He said he’ll tell the girls and ask them if they think it’s funny or interesting. I told him to please leave them out of it since I don’t want them to compare each other’s bodies and make them self-conscious. He didn’t acknowledge that and talked about something else. It was all chill for the next few hours. 


On the car ride home, Gary out of nowhere told the girls about my observation and how I thought it was funny and interesting. He asked them if they felt the same way. The girls agreed that it wasn’t funny or interesting at all, but rather weird and inappropriate. I defended myself that I only got the idea because I noticed my girlfriend staring at Zoey’s boobs a few times. My girlfriend said that Zoey has nice boobs and she can stare, but it’s inappropriate for me to comment on their boobs and body to Gary, and make it like a competition. 


I told her that I wasn’t trying to make it a competition between her and Zoey, and frankly it’s super rude for Gary to bring up our private conversation with them, knowing it will cause unnecessary tension.  My girlfriend said that it was good for Gary to bring it up because she needs to know when I’m acting out of line. Zoey also said that she’s glad to know that I’ve been observing her boobs and she will cover up around me from now on. I told them that it’s not that serious, but they wouldn’t let me off the hook. I’m pissed at Gary and my girlfriend is pissed at me now.",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my sons' father that if he wants to be in their life, he should help support them? | Background: Several years ago, I was seeing someone, Mark, casually. We got along well, enjoyed each other, and after about a year despite taking precautions, I got pregnant. We hadn't specifically discussed what we would do, and to make it more complicated, we found out early on that I was pregnant with twins. He was uncertain at first, and decided after not too long that he wasn't ready to be a father. I didn't want to force him, and I'm super fortunate to have a job that allowed/allows me to support my little family, as well as a wonderful social network. So, we parted ways, I let him know when the boys were born, and I asked that he at least keep me up to date on his contact information, in case of emergency, or if they wanted to meet him some day.

On to the issue: My sons are now almost three, they're beautiful, sweet, gregarious little dudes, and I don't have a single regret in the world. I recently got engaged to the love of my life (John). Shortly after we announced our engagement, I heard from Mark again, first time since a few weeks the boys were born.

He didn't mention the engagement, but I'm pretty sure someone told him, and that's why he reached out. I won't lie, I was taken aback, and I just don't like the idea of adding him back into the mix and making things more complicated... So this could for sure be coloring my responses, and I want to be sure I'm being fair.

Mark wants to see his sons. He specifically talked about seeing them ""a few times, where \[they\] can play"" and ""see how it goes"". To me, this sounds like he wants a trial run or something, and then decide if he enjoys it enough to see them more. I told him that although I'm absolutely open to him seeing the boys and being part of their lives, I'm not comfortable with what seems like a trial run setup, and that I would like him to decide, or we could meet and discuss, whether he wants to be an ongoing part of their life, and what that would look like. I also told him that if he does want to be involved, that I'll be expecting him to pay some form of child support from here on out, although we'd need to figure out what that looks like.

It's been three years, he's met them only once, and as awesome as my kids are, they're still a serious handful, and parenting isn't something you just get to do when it's fun. I don't want someone in and out of their lives, I want them to have consistent, loving people around. Mark got pretty angry, accused me of being with John just to replace him, and basically of trying to extort money from him and keeping his kids hostage. I feel like I'm trying to put reasonable expectations and boundaries out there, but I don't want to deny my boys the chance to know their father, and I'm worried that my kneejerk reaction is too strong and I'm being unreasonable.

1,"AITA for not inviting my sister to spend Christmas with us? | For context, my wife does not like my sister at all. My sister is fairly high-energy and tends to be loud and very chatty, which really gets on my wife's nerves. She's a nice person but can be annoying and overly dramatic sometimes. We live about four hours apart and usually see each other two or three times a year. We don't have any other family in the area. 

My wife and I have been trying for a family for years. She's had three prior miscarriages, which have been really hard on both of us, but this year, she had a successful pregnancy for the first time and gave birth to our daughter Julia in September. This is going to be our first Christmas as a new family, and it's really important to my wife for it to be just the three of us. 

On Friday, my sister called me up really upset and told me she found out her husband was having an affair, and now they're getting a divorce. He already moved out to be with his mistress, and she's moving out as soon as the lease on their apartment ends in February. She asked if she could come stay with us for the holidays to take her mind off of everything. 

I asked my wife what she thought, and she said she feels bad for my sister but she really wants our first Christmas to be just us as a family. She said it's been a stressful year, and she needs to decompress and doesn't have the energy to deal with my sister. I called my sister back and apologized and said unfortunately it wouldn't be possible for her to come over for Christmas, but I would drive down after the holidays and help her pack and move into her new apartment. My sister started to cry and said I was a horrible brother and hung up.

1,"AITA for making a joke about a senior colleague's pregnancy? | I [29F] am a nurse working at a hospital, and today I was chatting to one of the senior surgeons, who I will call Amy. 

Amy is one of the best in her field in the country, but is also gorgeous and glamorous. While she wears scrubs for operations, any other time at work she wears these beautiful suits that look like they cost more than I make in six months. The dresses she wears at work parties are breathtaking. She's only a few years older than me but I ask her for fashion advice all the time. 

Amy is pregnant and is well into her maternity leave. She's due in a few weeks. She dropped in briefly to hand in some paperwork and also just to have a little catch up with the girls while she had time. 

She looked completely different. She still looked absolutely beautiful and had the cutest big belly, but I've never seen her like this before. Instead of the smart suits she was wearing tracksuit bottoms, and a t shirt that was so baggy it obviously belonged to her BF. When she admitted that she'd started wearing her boyfriend's shirts everywhere, I joked ''Obviously not fitting in your suits anymore.'' It was meant as a joke but she responded ''fuck off!''. 

She was off with me the rest of the time, and when she headed off she hugged a few people because it will be the last time they see her before she gives birth, but she didn't hug me and left without saying goodbye. While we aren't super close I've always got on well with her. While I don't work directly under her I appreciate that she's a superior and have always respected her as such. 

I texted her afterwards to say that I'm sorry if I said anything that upset her and that I wish her all the best, but she blue ticked me.

My grandad, mom and dad were at home and I showed them it. They all laughed and said it was suited me. 

My brother came home with his friend and they both saw me wearing it. My brother said, ""what the fuck are you doing wearing my shit?"". When he said that, everyone was shocked including his friend. I tried to explain why I wore it but he told me to take it off as I had no right to wear it. He also added that his friend died in Iraq so I was being a horrible person for pretending to sacrifice something. His friend (currently in the Navy) said that it wasn't that bad and that he let's his family members dress up using his uniform. He walked out and went upstairs.

1,"AITA for telling an employee that she is NOT allowed to take a day off to grieve for her dog that died? | I’m not going to give too many details about my job, but I will say that I work in a corporate office where the staff is well-paid with good benefits. This one employee (who I will call Stacy) is decent at what she does. However, she takes more personal days than most people, for whatever reason. We have a certain number set aside but they aren’t really meant to be used as vacation days. 

Stacy called in a little while ago sobbing and saying that her dog she’s had for 10 years died and she was too distraught to come to work today. I remember her talking a lot about the dog being very sick a few weeks back, so I believe she was telling the truth. I said I was very sorry to hear about the dog but that, unfortunately, she had already maxed out her personal days for the year. (Which is true - we have an online system that tracks this). 

Stacy said she didn’t realize she had run out of personal days. She then asked if she could take a 1-day bereavement period. Now, we do have a policy for death. Immediate family = 5 weekdays off, paid. Extended family = 2 weekdays off. Certain other enumerated  categories of people = 1 weekday off. All of these terms are defined in the company policy and it is very clear that it refers to *people.*  So I told Stacy that her dog’s death does not fall within the scope of the policy. 

Stacy became increasingly upset and said she didn’t feel the system was meant to be so “rigid” and “oppressive”. She then asked if I could just count this  as a sick day and log it in the system as that. Now, I technically could (incorrectly) log this in the system as a sick day, and she does have some left. But, frankly, I was not inclined to do it. We are all extremely busy and tons of people at the office have a lot going on in their personal lives. They still show up. 

So I told her I couldn’t do that. I said if she didn’t show up it would be an unexcused absence and that I would be reviewing her attendance record carefully to determine if there were grounds for her termination. Stacy expressed her “disappointment” and “disgust” but said she’s coming in.

1,"AITA for playing with a ouija board even though it terrifies my wife? | I am an atheist, my wife is Catholic but not super religious. It’s never been an issue in our relationship up until this point.

I recently had some friends over. We were drinking, and got to talking about ghosts and scary movies. One of my friends said he had a ouija board in his car and that we should play with it. I thought, what the hell, it’ll be funny. So he brought it in and we fucked around with it. It ended up being really fun, we all tried to scare each other with it. I personally don’t believe that ouija boards do anything, but some of my friends do, and so it was funny seeing them get freaked out when I manipulated the game piece. We also told some stupid jokes and it was hilarious. 10/10, would recommend playing drunk ouija board.

My wife ended up coming down to say goodnight and she flipped her shit when she saw the ouija board. She started having a panic attack and told us to “get that evil thing out of the house.” It was extremely embarrassing. My friends packed up and went home.

We got into a huge argument. My wife told me that this is a boundary for her and she does not want me using a ouija board in our home, ever. I think it’s ridiculous for her to try to control what I can and can’t do with my friends based on her religious beliefs. She says that if I don’t respect this boundary, I’m an asshole. I say if she keeps trying to control me, she’s an asshole.

My friends and I are already planning another get together and they want to bust out the ouija board again. I’m planning on letting them. It’s fun and harmless. My wife is pissed and told me she will never forgive me if I go through with it. She even got my mom involved, and my mom said I’m being a huge asshole too.

At this point I’m furious because it’s my house and I’m being told I can’t play a GAME with my friends because my wife believes it’s evil. Wtf?

They were out of town for the holidays and the weather is still nice here, so I decided to take advantage and use this opportunity to tan naked in the backyard. I like being able to even out my tan lines in the comfort of my own home. 

My most recent tanning session was interrupted by a neighbor at my door. My neighborhood has lots of inclines and hills in it, so there is actually a house above our backyard that can see into it. This woman had caught her husband peeking at me while tanning and was irate that I would be nude outdoors. I calmly told her I was free to dress how I liked in the comfort of my home, and it is not my fault where her husband does or doesn't look. She proceeded to yell at me for being a tramp.

0,"AITA for refusing to work overtime at a reduced rate of pay? | Context. I work in the NHS. I wont say exactly where other than a major hospital in the South of England. I am not medical staff but work with the waste department. For this reason I'm using a burner account. Buckle in, this is a little complicated...

The story. I've been working for the waste department for a few years now. Its never been great pay, and there is a lot of heavy lifting and a hell of a lot of walking. There is also some considerable risk involving clinical waste, needles and other less pleasant stuff we have to be specially trained to deal with, to both be safe for those using the hospital and our own health and safety. 

Last year I would add on some 10-15 hours of overtime average a week. You never get fat in this job as you'll walk a minimum of 5 miles (we've measured it with apps in our team and it averages 8-10 a day) across the site. Its 35 hours a week contract and we all barely scrape by on that. The overtime really helped. Most of the guys would also donate some 30 mins of their own time simply in helping out with menial tasks that we never got the time for during our shift.

Annoyingly one of those higher up in the Trust decided we cost too much (yes, their actual words; almost as if it was our fault, despite their salary being about 3x our yearly pay) and looked at ways to cut costs. Eventually they decided to cut our overtime and use what is called NHSP - an internal NHS based agency. Those on that additional employment contract do not get any enhancements for weekends or unsocial hours so they typically get up to £20 or £30 less a day than our/my personal normal shift.

Most of the guys have a chat and I suggest I wont be signing up to NHSP to work the same work for less money. I have also heard of many admin issues (payment not happening, issues with documentation, education/training records not being kept properly). Most agree they'll cut back to normal contracted hours. 

The Trust is NOT happy with this. Cue lots of begging. Cue a struggle to get staff to sign up on NHSP (as most that do end up leaving within a couple of weeks due to sheer frustration). Our resolve is strong. We simply will not work the same job for less money. The top boss has suggested that we're now ""the problem"" and maybe we should also be working through our unpaid breaks. Its been suggested to us that they're now reviewing contracts in light of the department tender being close to review.

0,"AITA for snapping at my vegan bully in front of everyone? | I (16f) don’t have the best time at school esp with a kid (17m) that basically bullies me, we’ll call him Jaustin for reasons. Jaustin has made fun of me since middle school, would pay his friends to ask me out only to take it back, and called me ugly and dumb to my face. I have reported him but all that’s happened was separation in classes. It keeps getting downplayed and he never gets punished for how he acts towards me. He’s also a vegan and made a Vegan Club at school.

I was eating a burger from the cafeteria and told my friend that it was gross and I put it down. Jaustin had walked by at that exact moment behind me and got really angry. He went around the table to get in my face and started to yell, “That’s because it’s not vegan, you dumb bitch!”

I instantly had tears in my eyes and was shaking. My friend was silent and Jaustin kept going, calling me an animal killer, a bitch, etc. His Vegan Club friends noticed the chaos I guess and came up to me only to back Jaustin up in what he was saying. 

My friend told me “let’s go” because she was scared but I was so embarrassed for crying at this point that I got really angry. I then started to scream and the part of the cafeteria we were in got quieter. I basically told Jaustin that he was a nobody whose personality was just to be a little bitchass that terrorizes others. I said I don’t care about veganism and you should do what you want but not to be aggressive about it with me bc of my own choices. I will admit that i ended with, “Vegan Club is STUPID!” Jaustin was about to scream back but his friends pulled him away. Luckily a teacher saw and he got detention and I had to see the principal but my mom got them to back down on me.

I was holding my birthday party at this bakery, they had produced a specially made birthday cake for us. It had luscious gold frosting with blue insides, and oh my gosh I'm rambling about the cake. 

Anyways, my friend asked me to get some cake for her because she has bad social anxiety. I said yes, and got a big slice for her. 

While she was eating it, this big rash started to appear on her arm, I asked her if anything was wrong. She said that there might've been peanuts in the cake and she would get out her epipen. This was news to me, as I didn't know she was allergic to anything besides pollen.

Before I knew it, she fell out of her chair and started to cough really loudly. My bf and 3 of my siblings who were in the room started to panic, and one of my siblings had an anxiety attack. My other two siblings busted in the room and my oldest sibling (20f if ur curious) managed to get the epipen and injected my friend with it. 

Thankfully, the injection had its effects right away, and my friend stopped coughing. 

My family called me a major asshole, and that I should've checekd in with my friend first. My bf doesnt think that I'm an asshole since I didn't know that the cake would cause such a bad reaction. My friend is neutral on the matter.

0,"WIBTA if I put my roommates comfort over my boyfriend? | So I’m going to spare the details of the state of my relationship, but my bf and I are rocky at the moment. He’s suffering from depression and anxiety and been extra needy lately in the light of a few rejections and anticipation for the future.

It’s been hard on us, but not to sound harsh, he’s not doing anything except moping. I convinced him to see a psychologist for the sake of our relationship but it’s a long waiting list.

He’s kind of spoiled and comes from a rich family and would rather live off of credit than get a “menial” job while waiting for an acceptance to come in. I get it, I’ve worked retail and stuff -it sucks- and realistically he doesn’t have to if he doesn’t want to. His life and we don’t live together 

BUT he has nothing to do. He has some friends but they’re all mutual and he’d rather hang out with me. Especially at nights because it’s when it acts up. 

So I share an apartment with my roommate/ best friend from Highschool. We were all studying at the same college. She happens to work late nights at a grocery store. 

We also live with my cat, whom I love and cherish.

He is normally fantastic, but has taken a turn with my Bfs depression. (Maybe he can sense it?)

So whenever my bf tries to sleep over (even though it has been fine for the last 1 1/2 years) he won’t settle down and often wakes us up. 

His food and everything is in my room so i can’t just shut him out (plus he would just scratch at my door). When BF is gone, there are no problems 

When we BOTH are gone, my cat goes wild enough to wake up my roommate. 

She’s super nice about it and just asked when she worked late, if I could either take the cat with me or sleep at home. 

I thought it was reasonable and agreed. We’re friends and she handled it better than most 

Because my BFs roommate is allergic to cats, he can’t come. Which Is understandable. 

He also said he’s done sleeping over my apartment until the cat gets better because he’s losing sleep and it’s frustrating him -also understandable 


So in light of holiday season, my roommate is working max hours. She needs to be out every night late (~1am/ 2am) plus be up again relatively early for class/ appointments 

I let my bf know that was the deal and he asked if we could do 50/50. 50% of the time the roommate puts up with it, and the other 50 I go to him because he’s getting super depressed staying alone every night 

I refused because, she’s my friend. And it feels like a dick move. I get he’s depressed and lonely, but she works. If he wants to come he can, frankly, him not getting any sleep doesn’t impact his non-existent schedule

Last Friday I bought a 3.5 lb corned beef brisket, a head of cabbage, and a bag of red potatoes for St.Patricks Day. My other half and I decided to cook it yesterday because it was their birthday. So I take my time, rinse the brisket, cook it up, and figure it'll last us about 3 or 4 days if we put it into sandwiches. I had buns ready and even had cabbage done and a few potatoes. We ate last night. I had two sandwiches and so did he. I went to sleep and he stayed up. I woke up and the entire Brisket is gone. I'm livid. How in the actual hell did he eat ALL OF IT?! He's left us with 3 red potatoes and a half head of cabbage but now there's no meat to even make anymore sandwiches.

0,"AITA for being angry w my parents for losing my national insurance number | so this is a bit of a long story so buckle up. 

in scotland you are given a national insurance number when you turn sixteen, when mine arrived in the mail my parents told me they would keep it safe and one day when i needed it to apply for a job (which they had been pressuring me about) they revealed that they had lost it. naturally i got upset and told my parents that i was really annoyed with them. 

we’ve been having a strained relationship lately and this was just the tip of the iceberg as i’ve been feeling really unwanted because my mum seems to want to spend more time with my younger sister than myself even getting to the point of showing joy when my sister agrees to hang out with her compared to when i do she tries to get out of it.

idk it’s a lot of deep family issues that my parents have never addressed with me which i feel makes it all worse at the end of the day. 

so today when i was applying for uni i saw that i need a national insurance number to do so and since my parents also lost my birth certificate i have to wait a month to get one as i need to have a birth certificate to apply for a NI number. 

this has really stressed me out because i know my parents will procrastinate so i’m scared that i won’t be able to apply for uni which is my worst fear. when i brought that up to my mum she brushed it off and said ‘it wasn’t her responsibility’ for both the loss of the NI and the birth certificate which ended in another argument which became vicious with some name calling.

0,"Aita for letting a stranger’s kid run into me? | I was walking down the sidewalk today when a group of kids came running towards me. Where I live it’s a widely agreed upon convention that pedestrians keep right except to pass in the way that cars do. These kids were in my lane and they were old enough to know better. In the distance I heard a parent put out a half assed “watch where you’re going, Kaden.” 

Kaden didn’t watch where he was going. 

As anticipated it soon became clear he expected me to get out of his way for him. I saw this as a teaching opportunity and decided to not alter my walking path or cadence. Shortly after he ran face first into me. Now I’m not entirely heartless so I made sure he didn’t connect with my knee, but he did land square on his butt. Once on the ground he thought for a moment, rolled over, hopped up, and ran away. The absence of an apology was noted. 

I feel what I did was reasonable. I firmly believe that if I had moved out of his way I’d’ve reinforced his bad behavior. By assisting him to the ground I helped him learn an important lesson about keeping right and the consequences of being careless. Mombie clearly wasn’t impressed but didn’t say anything.

0,"AITA for snapping at my best friend over her concerns on my eating habits? | For some context: I (26 F) have been friends with Anna (Not her real name, 27 F) for almost eleven years. Anna is extremely important to me because she is the first friend I made at school when my family moved to our current country. She's currently studying to be a nutritionist. 

Being my best friend, she knows some things about me that no one else does, mainly, that I have big body image issues and some trouble with my eating habits because of it. In my culture, beauty and self presentation are extremely important, and I grew up being constantly told I should strive to be a pageant winner and beauty queen, so my parents had always been on top of everything I ate and super judgy on any fast food or sweets I treated myself to. This led to me feeling guilty over anything ""unhealthy"" in my diet, among other issues. 

&#x200B;

Now, lately I've been feeling a lot better about myself, so last friday I decided to treat myself and went to a pub with my coworkers, had a couple of beers and decided to post a story on Instagram. I woke up the next morning to a repply from Anna telling me to ""Eat better, dammit!"", and being a sensitive issue to me, I tried to laugh it off, but she insisted and told me ""I'd get a beer gut for not taking care of myself"". 

It is not the first time she's told me something like this, so I snapped. I told her I wasn't going to die over a couple beers and proceeded to remind her why those kind of comments feel hurtful to me, and that it hurt coming from her, specially since she's seen me cry and lock myself in my room over the years because of it. I didn't use any bad words or insults, but I admit I was a bit agressive in my stance. 

Anna got upset and said she's concerned and just wants to take care of me, that she's not a mind reader to know I'd be so affected by a single passing comment, she just wants to see me happy and healthy because we're friends and she loves me and feels its her duty as a soon-to-be nutritionist. She also reasoned that since we now live a couple hours away, she can only know about my eating habits from what I post, and well, I don't go taking pictures of my salads and granola cups daily.

Whereas she used to say ""cup of tea"", she now says ""cuppa"" and instead of ""stew"" she says ""hash"". Suffice to say, I have never heard these words before & I don't understand them . She feels like I should because I used to live in The Hague and I was in a British immersion school so I should've grown up with these words around me but I did not....anyways I digress .

1,"AITA for asking my sister to throw my baby shower party when she is suffering from infertility | this is a confusing one sorry

i 20 f am dating my sister Lucy's ( 28 f ) boyfriend (josh 29 m) of 3 ish years that she broke up with. i know there's a whole thing surrounding dating a siblings ex but please hear me out.

We live in relatively small village, it's a 10 mile drive to the nearest town, and i haven't got my drivers licence yet because I've been too busy with work and classes. Lucy and Josh started dating around late 2016 and got engaged in 2018.

Then in early 2019 Lucy found out she can't have children due to a problem with her ovaries. I don't know exactly what went on but after the infertility diagnosis Lucy became very depressed, she went on antidepressant medicine and started therapy.

A few weeks after starting therapy she and Josh broke up, mutually apparantly. Josh lives just down the road from us so i see him out and about on the farm quite often.

It just kind of happened naturally, we grew closer together and went on some dates, but then i fell unexpectedly pregnant but i kept it secret from Lucy because she is still very down and depressed.

In my opinion Josh can't just never move on, and someone shouldn't be forever off limits because your sibling briefly dated them.

So i decided after 2 months that it was time to tell Lucy, soon I'll start to show and I'm planning on moving in with josh before the baby arrives but shit . hit. the. fan.

She's living back at home now and has been since the break up, and she looks awful, she mostly slouches around in her pjs, i sat her down and said i have some news. i told her i was with josh and that im expecting,  i told her it would mean the world to be if she would be god mother to the baby and asked if she would like to plan the shower for me as i know she absolutely thrives on parties. 

She didn't even react, just asked me to leave I made the point that it's our parents house. I know on paper this sounds bad, it really dose but i should be allowed to live my life and so should Josh.

The baby was unplanned and something we couldn't have forseen, i know that is probably a bit of salt in the wound but i couldn't have helped a complete supprise. i love my sister and want to see her happy but she text me this morning saying this

: lucy : Thanks for letting me know your dating josh, oh and that your pregnant with his child, congratulations you achieved what i could not, i am in such a bad place and you will never understand, josh and i agreed i needed time and medication and then we would try again but i guess he never told you that did he.
as for your baby shower all i can say is well done,  you always were good at telling jokes.
i hope you rot in hell you evil bitch.

0,"AITA for keeping my son during my visitation instead of giving in to his mother? | I guess some backstory is due here. My ex and I have an 8 year old son, and we have been split up for a few years now. I have every other weekend parenting time along with a day during the week. It’s not enough time for me, but it’s what was legally decided through court. Her and I do not have the best relationship currently because I feel like I’m always being taken advantage of and I allow it because she always uses the “it’s for your son” excuse.

I cherish my time with my son, but for the longest time, I allowed my ex to alter the parenting schedule to suit my son’s needs, whether for activities or family or if he just wasn’t feeling well. I always tried to be as accommodating as possible, even if it meant I didn’t see him for a week or more.

Anyway, last Wednesday I was supposed to get him overnight, his mother called me and I asked if he could stay there since his cousin from out of town was staying with them. I reluctantly agreed but told her I wanted to get him Thursday instead. She agreed, and when Thursday came around, I texted her after work and said I was on my way to get him. She said they weren’t home, and I had to press her for information why. She decided to take the kids to a lake and said I needed to stop being grumpy because my son was having fun.

We argued back and forth and since I did not drive all the way out to the lake to get him when I shouldn’t have had to in the first place, I told her that we should switch weekends (last weekend was hers, this one is mine) so that I had my make up time and his activities with her that fell on my weekend wouldn’t be interrupted.

She refused, so now that my weekend is coming up, I’m not getting him at my regular time today because he’s at an amusement park with her family, and I am expected to give up even more of my valuable time tomorrow for their annual 4th of July party.

1,"AITA for putting a dog poo in an old lady's bin? | This happened a while ago but my husband and I still disagree whether I was an asshole or not.

I was walking along our road with my dog when she decides to do her business outside our neighbour's house. I'm getting the dog poo bag out ready when my elderly neighbour comes out her house. I say ""hello, how are you?"" very friendly. I don't know her but we see each other in passing. She doesn't say hello, just says ""DON'T put that poo in my bin"", in a very vicious voice. I have scooped it into the bag by this point and I say ""I wasn't going to"". She says ""yes you were, I've seen you do it before"". Now just so you know, I have NEVER put poo in her bin, or any of my other neighbours! Although all our bins are actually owned by the council, I usually put dog poos in a public bin. Sometimes I have to use someones 'house' bin when I can't find another bin, but I've never done it to anyone in my road.

She starts having a massive go at me in the street saying I was going to do it, so I get defensive because I'm being accused of something I didn't do and being told that I've done it before, even though I haven't! So I say ""well if you're going to accuse me of something then I might aswell do it"", then I open her bin in front of her and put the bag of dog poo in it!

She starts almost screeching then her son comes out the house to see what all the fuss is about. She says she can't reach in to get the bag of poo, so her son gets it out the bin and tries to give it back to me. I refuse to take it. My husband has turned up by this point so he takes the poo. Then we leave and have an argument because he says I was an asshole and I say I wasn't (he only turned up at the end so missed the part where she was yelling at me in the street for ten minutes). I should probably add that I did swear at her at some point.

I think I'm not an asshole because 1. she was rude to me, 2. she accused me of something I didn't do, 3. the bin isn't technically hers anyway, and 4. why the hell does a teeny bag of dog poo being in there matter anyway?! I will fully accept my judgement if I'm wrong though. So AITA?",False,False

I got engaged to my girlfriend about three months ago and it's been great so far. We're not planning to have a long engagement and intend to get married in May so we've been busy getting things ready but have had no other issues with the stress of getting married.

Basically the issue is that whenever I meet new people I will introduce my girlfriend as my girlfriend rather than my fiancee. At first I think she brushed it off but now she's been getting annoyed at me and brought it up in conversation a few times. I refuse to stop though; I don't like the idea of a ""fiancee"" to me you're either married or you're not. For now we are just boyfriend and girlfriend, and in a few months we will be husband and wife, there is no need for an intermediate stage.

She has been very insistent that I refer to her as my fiancee but the most I am willing to say is ""my girlfriend who I am engaged to"". It really is a matter of personal preference and not something that should matter at all in my view; to her though it's really important.

0,"WIBTA for not photographing my brothers show | Okay so my brother (M23) is in a gymnastics club. They do an annual show and my brother is the host/announcer of the whole thing. 

He's basically on-stage between every divisions performance, making jokes and small theatrical numbers while the crew is preparing the stage for the next divisions performance.

Last year my brother couldn't find anyone in the club willing to photograph the show, so he asked me (M 21) if I'd be willing to do it, as I am a hobby photographer with rather professional equipment. I agreed, and photographed the whole thing and delivered a few dozen pics to use for their website and what not. My mother then asked if she could have some of the pics to design a photobook for my brother as a christmas gift. I was happy to help and my brother loved the gift.

Ok so fast forward to this year.

The preparations for the show are almost done as the show is set in two weeks. As my brother hasn't asked me to be the photographer again yet, I assumed he found someone from the club that would do it. But now two weeks before the event he asked me anyway. I was a little taken confused as to why hed ask me just two weeks in advance, which seemed a little on short notice. So I asked him how come they didnt have a photographer lined up yet, and how come he didnt ask me earlier.

He then tells me that they in fact have a photographer but he wants me to take photos too, so he could get a photobook again.

So I told him that:

1. I dont want to photograph alongside another photographer

There is no strict rule -- my parents say they're happy to hear even about crushes or brief relationships -- but I tend to just do as my brothers do.

My parents came to visit to celebrate my birthday, and I arranged a dinner with some friends -- K, my roommates, and my ex, C, with whom I am still close. My parents had previously met C and one roommate, so when we all got together as a group to walk over to the restaurant, I introduce K and the other roommates just by their names, ""you know my friends C and M, and this is K and this is J"", trying to keep everything casual. My parents shake hands, say hi, we head over to eat. 

During the evening, K takes me aside quietly to say that when I had invited him, he had thought this was **the** meeting of the parents, and that he would be introduced as my boyfriend. I had made it clear it would be a group event, but he explained that it still felt hurtful to be introduced as just a friend, like I was ashamed of him.

I explained that, given I had **never** introduced a current boyfriend to my parents, or even told them about him, I didn't want to add any pressure to him and give them the chance to get to know him without the filter of him being their youngest and only daughter's new boyfriend. He said it made him question how seriously I take our relationship, if I was still waiting for **the** person to bring home after 15 months together.

When we went back to the table, I quietly mentioned to my dad that K and my stepmother seemed to get along, and he had some competition. My dad said he thought K seemed like a great guy and a *very good friend* (zero subtlety) and I said I had been a bit dishonest to say he was *just* a friend, and that was that. At the end of the night, my dad shook K's hand and said he was welcome for Christmas ""provided you can tolerate \[OP\] until then"". This did a bit to reassure K, but we had a long discussion after. 

While I understand K's point of view, I maintain that it was not that dickish of a move, given my motivations. However, it was gnawing at me lately that I may have been more an asshole than just thoughtless, and wanted to get some feedback.",False,False
0,"AITA for defending my family by exploding on my uncle when my dad had a heart attack? | Back in the beginning of november my dad had a heart attack and had to undergo triple-bypass surgery. Exactly one month after the surgery he suffered another heart attack. He got transferred to a higher care hospital about 5 hours away.

Before the first heart attack, over thirty-eight years of marriage, my parents have spent less than a week apart from each other. And through all of this she spent every night sleeping in a chair or couch next to him. Its important to note that at this point he wasn't in danger of dying. During all this my mom was sending updates through group texts to her side of the family. So they know everything. For whatever reason though, the four oldest siblings (mom is 5 of 7) keep criticizing her for staying around and for not going back home.

One night after a particularly bad day, when my parents were trying to get to sleep for the night, my uncle sent a text specifically to my mom (outside of the group text). and here it is.

""Cindy I haven't said anything. I have read your texts and think everyone has tried everything they can. I don't want to see Bill leave us. But I told Kim, Duke, and Debby (his wife and kids) not to put me threw what Bill is going threw. I hope you dont get mad at me. It is hard, but I dont think Chris would want to be the way he is. I love you both. I dont want to see him suffer.""

My mom called me afterwards. The only time i've heard her more distraught was when dad had his second heart attack. I was able to talk her down and told her what he said was horrible and unacceptable. She asked me to say something to him. So, here is the response I sent him and to their group chat.

""Ted, I have never in my life read something as absolutely inconsiderate and hurtful as what you sent my mother tonight. She called me in literal anguish tonight over your words. In the middle of the night??? You have hurt her beyond measure. How dare you even suggest that dad doesnt want to live. Or that the measures we've gone through have been extreme. No fucking shit he doesnt want to ""be the way he is"" as you put it. He wants to go home and be with his family. He wants to watch his kids get married and be a grandfather. Hes going through this so that he can have many more years of love and fulfillment. But if it were up to you you would rob him of that chance? And if you were in his position you would really rob your family of that chance too. You are weak in body and in faith. You sicken me. Dont you ever try to speak for my dad. You dont have a fucking clue. And dont you EVER speak of anything like that to my mother again either. All that should ever be coming out of your mouth or your fingers after this are apologies. Just sick""

He hasn't apologized. All he has said since was ""that's not what I meant"" and ever since, mom has second guess every decision we've made for dad. She has lost her strength and now I have to be the one to console her and tell her we are making the right decisions. He truly hurt her.

1,"AITA for chastising my girlfriend for her lack of understanding of respect? | A bit of context:  I'm Filipino-American. My parents are both from the Philippines, moved here about 30 years ago, VERY intelligent and understand American culture. We are very much culturally Filipino. As any Asian culture, there is A LOT of emphasis on respect. In our family and extended family, it's almost imperative to greet each other warmly as well as well as saying goodbye to each other when leaving. Her mother had her very young (at 20) and my mother had me much later (in her mid 30s) so as you can tell, the family dynamics are very different. I am very close with her family.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 4 years now. She is American, born and raised.

I was raised to always greet everyone in the household and properly say goodbye and ""thank you for having me/having me over."" This is normal for my family. Honestly, for me it's a fucking no brainer. When we first started dating, she was having trouble grasping this, especially when it came to saying the goodbyes. Often she would just walk out and leave without acknowledging my parents. My parents pulled me aside and told me this. I thought OK that sucks but we can talk it out and I can make her understand. I know we are all raised differently and have different customs, so I pulled my GF aside and explained this to her. She was receptive and she began to greet them and say goodbye properly. Initially she was a bit cold/shut off to my parents but they gradually warmed up to her. Not that they didn't get along but she just had her walls up for some reason. I think she was probably intimidated. But almost 4 years later and they get a lot quite well now.

Last week, I noticed her grandfather was really in the need for a TV upgrade. It just so happens my parents have a old 40"" plasma sitting around so I asked if we could give it to him. They said sure. My GF and I went to pick it up from my parents, then dropped it off at her grandfather's. He was super happy and appreciative. Not long after that, my sister texts me and says that when we were there at the house picking up the TV, my GF didn't say goodbye to my father or thanks when she left. This pissed me off. First of all, it's super embarrassing and we've had this issue before, she knows better.

We talked tonight and I chastised her. How on earth could you go into someone's home, take something and not even say thank you? I told her I was tired of hearing it and being embarrassed. She retorted with, ""Well I'm tired of being nitpicked at. It's always going to be something."" She got defensive and pissed off. Apparently she said thank you to him, just not when we left. The talk did not end well. I just can't get it through to her head that this a big deal in my family. I wouldn't even dream of treating her parents the same way.

0,"AITA for dropping my stepdaughter | Literally my first post, and I am on mobile, I'll try to get the worst of the grammar.

Backstory and Cast (names changed / dropped for privacy) 

5 years ago I started dating M. M has 4 children, 2 girls, 2 boys. All between the ages of 23-28. The two girls have 3 children each. (We'll call one S)

The second girl, G, recently had a hard life lesson. Her husband has been since I've known him emotionally abusive, controlling, he liked to blame his bipolar and borderline personality disorder for his actions toward his wife, but he's a good father. It sounds strange I'm sure, he was a different person with the kids. 

So, on to the current scenario.

A few weeks ago, G called me one night telling me she didn't feel comfortable staying home. I immediately went and fetched her to stay the night with us. The whole night her husband is blowing up her phone, almost nonstop. The next morning, he's still going. She doesn't want to come home. 

Five minutes later he shows up on my doorstep and gives me their youngest (1 year, older two in school) no diaper bag. He wants in. I told him no. He was 6'4, 200 lbs. If he got in there was NO way I could get him out. G, goes out for 20 minutes to talk, and comes back in sobbing, he'd threatened his own life, we called 911 gave them the car info while I called in for supplies for the baby from a friend.

While speaking with the police the sheriff called in, they found the car wrapped around a tree, he was in the hospital, critical condition. 

I was there with G, through everything over the next few weeks.

Arrangement for the children to be picked up from school, to and from her job, getting his family in from out of state. Going through the trashed car to pull his tools. I had been taking her driving for months and she finally got her license. She told me she was going to leave him. That she deserved better. I was so proud of her, stepping into her new found roll so flawlessly. I was working on getting her a car to replace the one he'd totalled.

In that time, he was released from the hospital. Into the care of G's sister, S. Who lives two doors down. 

Last night I got a message. 

""He came home, it wasn't forced, he's different now"" 

I was done.

For months during our driving lessons I'd explained the cycle of abuse, how it waxes and wanes depending on what he wants. 

She knows.

But when I found out I told her I needed time. Because I Am upset. She almost had it. I explained to her that I didn't want to blow up and say things that might hurt her, that I wasn't mad, just disappointed. 

So the question is, AITA for pulling my assistance (driving her too and from work, she was also looking for me to take one child to daycare along with financial aid and favors) to take time to process? She has access to a car to borrow until we get the titles for the one she's buying. 

I just feel guilty, but I'm also hurt.

1,"AITA for making my girlfriend do all the cooking? | So I’m not very good at cooking, I can make about two dishes, fried eggs, and scrambled eggs. Except the scrambled eggs are bad. I don’t enjoy cooking and I don’t have the time for it either.

My girlfriend loves cooking, it’s one of her favourite hobbies and she is great at it, can even make her own pasta and all. 

She cooks almost all the time, and when it is up to me to sort dinner I never cook, I always order take away or get really easy to make microwave meals, although I try to keep it healthy. Recently she started complaining that I don’t do any cooking and that the meals are rarely any good when its my turn, so I offered to pick different places or get different meals but she insists that unless I start learning to cook and cook meals then I’m being a jerk because our relationship is “unbalanced”. 

Here is my point, if I were cooking for myself I would do the exact same. I do not expect or demand of her to cook, if she wanted to she could order us takeaway and I would accept that. She is cooking from her own choice, and I don’t believe that that means I should have to cook too. I asked my closest friend and he was torn on this.

1,"AITA for agreeing with my friends that my wife is fat? | I love my wife, but she is not small. I mean she is only about 5 feet tall, but she's 140lbs, which is pretty big for someone her height. She's curvy, yes, but has a floppy stomach and flab on her arms and thighs, etc. 

Let me be clear: I have never cared that this is the case. I love her. I'm attracted to her. She has healthyish habits, I think she just sometimes overindulges in things like beer and ice cream. She's definitely not an alcoholic, but beer calories add up. I would prefer my wife be somewhat fat than be someone who is obsessed with staying 90lbs (not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just my preference, all bodies are good bodies and all of that). 

Some of my friends and I were over watching a game and shooting the shit, and it turned to dating. I'm the only married guy among us. One of the guys just started dating a new girl, who also happens to be rather fat (my guess is like 5'6 175?). The subject came up about her weight, and the guys razzed him. I chimed in and said I thought the girl was cute, she's really nice, and the guys in turn told me that I didn't get to comment because I was a chubby chaser, as evidenced by marrying my wife. 

I laughed along with this and said ""Yeah, (Wife) is pretty big too, huh?"" But wouldn't you know that was when my wife had come home from the gym. She heard it, passed through the room to make the point that she was there, and left to go upstairs to do girly shit. 

Later on, she approached me and told me it was hurtful, and that I'm an asshole for letting the guys call her fat. I argued that she knows she isn't thin, she's never tried to hide it, she's not ashamed of it, and that I love her as she is, so why does it matter? This isn't an end-all-be-all fight, she's already over it, but was I really an asshole for just shooting the shit with the guys and being realistic?",False,False
1,"AITA for denying I'm rich or spoiled? | So this is based on a conversation I had earlier today. I was in a group of my friends, and we were talking about an internship I had landed during summer break at a Private Wealth Management Fund run by my mom's brother's (who's a business professor) friend. I was asked when the internship started, and said for me it starts July 1st. Someone asked why it started that late, and I said that my parents were forcing me to go with them to Dubai, and that I hate Dubai. One guy in the group I was talking to, let's call him Harry, laughed at this and commented how spoiled I am. I asked him to elaborate, and he went on a rant about how he's never even been out of the country and how I'm complaining about Dubai, and so I was a spoiled rich kid who isn't grateful. I just told him I'm not really rich or spoiled- I just really don't like Dubai, and don't see why I need to be grateful when my parents are literally forcing me. He said I definitely was rich, since I live in a big house with a pool and have a relatively nice car. Most people were telling him to lay off by this point, and he did, but he kept glaring at me.

0,"AITA For refusing to invite my great aunt to my wedding? | I am getting married next year and I am having a very small wedding. I have a very small family at this point which consists of a cousin I see a couple of times a year, and my mother and grandmother whom I live with. My fiance on the other hand has a very large family whom she is close with and we both see often. I have run into some problems where my mother feels I have to do certain things in order for her to be happy.

For background I chose my close friends daughters as my flower girls, they were very excited. They maintain a close relationship with me even when my work schedule intervenes, and I am very close with his daughters.
My mother on hearing this insisted I invite my cousins daughters to be flower girls as well, telling me it would hurt my cousins and her daughters feelings, as well as deeply upset my mother. My mother spent days crying and insisting I don't care about my family at all. Sadly I see my cousin and her daughters only a couple of times a year despite an effort to keep in touch. I have little relations with my cousins or her daughters at best. My mother insisted and ultimately I Felt guilty and gave in and asked them. They showed little excitement about the prospect of being my flower girls and are unsure if they want to do it.

Fast foward and now my mother is insisting that I invite my great Aunt, with whom I have 0 relations and have only seen a few times in my life. The same guilt trip is being pushed on me, how it will upset my mother and grandmother and once again she claims it shows I ""Don't care about my family."" Furthermore my Great Aunt has difficulty walking at her age and would require me to invite my 2nd cousin who unfortunately is very trashy and I do not want attending. This 2nd cousin has also never been a part of my family life and I have met only a couple of times. My mother has told me she's so upset that I should just remove all her friends because I ""Don't care about her anyway""

Because we are having a small wedding our seating capacity is limited and myself and my fiance feel those 2 spots would be better utilized by people whom we care about and want to attend.

1,"AITA for holding a grudge over being passed over for the bridal party of a longtime friend? | Throwaway account just in case, though god only knows if this situation is common enough for that to matter or not. Buckle up, this is gonna get long.

So, my best friend. Let’s call her Mary. We’ve been friends for over a decade and we get along great. Like any friends, we have disagreements but we can tell each other anything. We’ve always been there for each other through painful breakups, bad grades on tests, big accomplishments, everything.

Mary recently got married and obviously I was thrilled for her. Now since high school at least, we’d always talk about getting married, being in each other’s bridal parties, etc. Obviously this is not a legally binding contract but things like that mean a lot to people, at least they did to me.

So several months before the wedding we’re hanging out and she breaks the news to me that they’ve decided to keep the bridal party family-only. Was I upset? Yeah, obviously, but hey, I can understand keeping things small. Then I find out that this family-only parry includes her fiancé’s brother’s girlfriend. Yeah, girlfriend. Not wife or even fiancée, girlfriend. I was blindsided and hurt, because to me, that’s NOT family. Mary and I might not share blood but in every other way we are sisters. I couldn’t believe she would do this to me. I know that being a bridesmaid might not be a big deal to everyone, but to me this felt like a complete betrayal of our friendship.

I told Mary I needed space and  she said she understood. We didn’t talk for a few months, the longest ever, but eventually I decided I didn’t want to lose our friendship over this. She knows more about me than probably anyone else in the world and I love her. So we made up and I went to the wedding. Honestly it was pretty painful for me to be there because I felt like an outsider rather than a best friend. But I made it through the night without bashing her husband’s brother’s girlfriend’s head in so hey, I’ll call that a win.

All was well, or not. I’ve noticed lately I’ve been rather petty in my stupid revenge. I’ll cancel plans last minute for no real reason, let the phone ring through to voicemail, leave texts on read, etc. We live quite far apart (as in several hours) so this can be a pretty big inconvenience as it’s no day trip. And yeah, like I said, I know this is all totally stupid, totally juvenile revenge. But it turns out I’m still hurt and angry and I don’t know what else to do. I tried talking to her about this before but I’ve always known she was someone who has “misters before sisters” priorities. I suspect it was his choice to do this for the bridal party for reasons I won’t get into, which is why I know if I talk to her about it she’ll just get defensive.

1,"WIBTA for asking a guest at my kid's first birthday to reimburse us for botched photography? | This might sound super, super petty, but we want a guest at our son's first birthday party to help pay in part for the photographer we hired because she ruined many photos.

We hired a photographer because it's a big day. Our first year being parents and our son's first birthday. We asked people to clear out away from the photographer at key moments because we didn't want people occluding the action. Things like opening gifts, taking a bite of cake, etc. We just wanted to get clear photos of these events and not have people stand in the way.

This guest in question isn't our friend, she was a +1 from one of our friends. I guess she didn't get the memo because she's in all of these shots. It's really not a big deal if she's in the corner or just slightly in frame on the sides, but I mean trying to put her face next to our son's face as he opens presents so she's center frame, doing bunny ears above his head, etc. 

The most egregious example and what prompted us to want to ask for reimbursement, was we put a dab of cake on our son's nose for a photo and her cellphone in her outstretched hand is in frame. Her phone's on and has Tinder on screen.

I don't blame our photographer. Things move fast with a toddler and things can be unpredictable. He frames, points, and shoots continuously, there's no time to stop, ask people to move, etc because in a moment the moment is gone.

We want to reach out and ask her to pay $100 for ruining these photos. We paid $800 for the photographer for 4 hours. All of the most important shots are ruined and cannot crop them to fix them. We wouldn't demand it, we'd ask, and if she said no, well then we never want to see her again at any function.

1,"AITA for laughing at my starstruck girlfriend? | Last year, my (22m) girlfriend (23f) won a radio contests to briefly meet and take a photo with one of her favorite kpop groups, NCT. She was super excited since I guess you would call her a superfan. I definitely feel like she's too old to put so much stock in kpop, but I generally don't talk to her about it, since it's pretty harmless, just annoying.

She was told that she could bring a plus one with her to the station to meet the band, and so she took me with her. Even in the car, she was so excited that she was shaking, and she kept saying that she wasn't sure she could do it. (I didn't care either way, I wanted it over with!) The meeting was honestly nothing special, all the band members said hi to her and shook her hand or offered her like a platonic hug. She cried for most of it (awkward) and kept bowing to the members (she's white) and while I didn't say anything, I was SO embarrassed for her. Some of the guys also shook my hand and greeted me, but a few of them didn't, probably noticing that I wasn't really into it. Whatever, it wasn't for me it was for her, I'm not a fan.

She has some other friends who are also kpop fans, and when we all hung out later, she started talking about how wonderful and surreal it was to meet her ""idols"". I then started laughing and telling her friends about how awkward she was, how she bowed to all of them despite none of them bowing to her, and made a joke about how they probably laughed at her once she was out of earshot. Complete silence, immediately everyone is death glaring at me. I try to clarify that she really was acting CRAZY for a 23 year old (I even looked up the band and half of them are teenagers!) and she retaliates that she probably made them feel less awkward than me, who didn't even talk to them. What the fuck, was I supposed to talk to a bunch of Korean guys I don't know? We ended up arguing about it privately but it's been a sore spot and we just don't bring it up. She barely even listens to kpop around me now.

Fast forward to now, a year-ish later. My girlfriend just bought 2 NCT tickets for her and her friend, which were very expensive and include YET ANOTHER fan meet. I mention buying a ticket myself so I can go along with them (not to the fanmeet though) and my girlfriend said she'd rather me not go because she doesn't want me to be bored or embarrassed.

But it got later in the day and I was getting tired, so I turned to Sally and I said, “I’d like a coffee now, thanks.” She stared at me like I’d said something really weird, and then the judge said, “She’s here to use her law degree, not get you coffee” to me in a very impatient tone. When we left our lawyer said, “never be rude to the judge’s clerks.” I was not aware that the clerks have a more involved role, I saw her and she was acting like a secretary, taking notes and not saying anything.

Before anyone starts conspiring, no, I'm not adopted. I have memories of me as a kid with the family, my mum and dad are on the birth certificate, I've even met my mum's midwife who delivered me - there's literally no way I was adopted tbh. 

I've looked through all the photo albums we have, in all the cupboards and paperwork - there's literally none of me at all. I find that bizarre since she has countless of all the others, just none of me. Tbh, she doesn't have much about me. She has all sorts of the others - photos, videos, certificates, trophies, artwork etc. They're put away all over the house but I can't find anything of mine. Not a single certificate or anything - not to brag but I certainly didn't lack any opportunities to get them. As a kid, I was extremely bright and talented (the good old days...) and was always winning something but the fact that not a single of them was kept has upset me. 

When I asked my mum about it, she basically told me that I shouldn't blame her for it because she had so many kids, it was hard to keep track. I can understand that - as child number 5, by the time I achieved something, one of the others had already done it before so it always lacked significance as I wasn't the first. But the fact that she has nothing of mine at all, but has things from the others has really upset me. 

WIBTA if I confronted her about it and told her how I feel? I don't want to upset her, and I can understand those things being insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but I'm frustrated that I can't find a single thing of mine as a kid and it makes me feel inferior to my siblings.

1,"AITA for changing my son's work schedule? | I am a small business owner. My son has worked on and off for me for 10 years. One holiday, our entire family got food poisoning and my son couldn't make it to work for a few days. When the next paycheck came, he saw that I had paid him for the days that he missed and he questioned me about it. He said that he didn't work those days and didn't expect to be paid for it. I told him that it wasn't his fault he got sick and had paid him anyway.


Fast forward a few months. Some other workers start joking about how he always leaves at 3pm when there is still work to be done. (He worked 7am-3pm while they work 7am to whenever the job is done and they are paid overtime). He replied that he'd be happy to stay, but figured I didn't want to pay him overtime. I took him aside and told him he was being selfish and that I have to be there from 6am to 7pm and reminded him that I paid him for those days he was sick. He replied that he would work whatever hours so long as he was paid for the hours he works and if he has overtime he expects to be paid for it. He said that I had always paid him for overtime in the past and that since he has no benefits, no 401k, etc. that it was unfair of me to ask him to stay until the work was completed if I wasn't going to pay him for the effort. He said he works through his breaks while everyone else takes a 15 min smoke break every 2 hours and that the 30k he makes a year isn't worth it if he has to work 50hrs a week and not earn OT. I told him I was changing him to salary.


I told him that some day I am leaving this business to him and he said he can't count on that happening, especially since he has no benefits or 401k or anything like that. He left at 3pm that day. I didn't fire him, but I changed his schedule to 11am to 7pm to ensure he would be present while production was finished. 


He resented me for it, and after some time he quit and hasn't been back. Our relationship has suffered and I am wondering if I am the asshole, or is he the asshole?",False,False
1,"AITA for ""snapping"" at my wife's step-mom when she keeps pointing out our age gap? | We so have an age gap. I started dating her when I was 26 and when she was 19. We got married 5 years later, and we currently have 2 kids 10 years later.
 
She has a step-mom after her parents divorced when she was 18. She has repeatedly told me several times that she doesn't see her step-mom as a motherly figure.
 
Let's call my step-mom-in-law, Jennifer. She has constantly pointed out our age gap. She keeps using the excuse that she's joking and that she really doesn't mean it. I have told her time and time again that I don't want her talking about that. She hasn't listened.
 
I broke yesterday. While me and Jennifer were together, alone, I aggresively scolded her. ""Don't fucking talk about me and my wife like that. She's not your daughter. She doesn't think of you as her mom. She never has, and never will if you don't change your attitude. Please, fucking stop.""
 
I made her cry. My wife doesn't think I stooped to far and that I'm an asshole. But, Jennifer sure as hell does.",False,False

0,"AITA For getting an abortion without telling an Ex I was pregnant? | I recently broke up with my boyfriend after he found Jesus again during our relationship. I'm firmly agnostic and he was athetist until he did a 180 after his father recovered from Cancer. 

We have a lot of mutual friends as we both went to a Christian private school since both our families are various degrees of religious. 

I found out two days ago I'm two weeks pregnant and have booked a termination since I'm uninterested I'm having a child with him. I confided in a close friend who is ultimately prochoice but she's said that I'm an asshole if I don't tell my ex about the kid before I do it. She thinks he deserves to know as the father and emotionally it will devastate him if he finds out in the future.

I think its more damaging if he were to grow attached to a child I have 0 intention of keeping. I am almost 100% certain if I tell him, he will harass me to keep it and try get together again. He's gone full fundementalist and one of the reasons we broke up is because I refused to go to church with him.

1,"AITA if I said “ Phew, at least we don’t get periods and pregnancy” | I (26M) and my wife (28F) went out for a dinner at a seafood restaurant called Blue Shrimp( I think you get my point) with a family friend and his wife. So my wife and his wife were talking, what mascara, eyeliner, and other makeup items etc. And then they started talking about periods and pregnancy( Wife is on period and delivered a baby boy 3 months ago) and me and Joshua ( the family friend) started talking about dude stuff because they were really into their conversation. At the end I said to Joshua” Phew, at least we don’t get periods or get pregnant”
Joshua said”Mhm, we sure do have easier lives than females.” His wife looked at him with 90 degree turn from my wife to him stunned like she just saw a falcon in the sky. After 10 minutes we left and then my wife said “ Wow, did you have to say that there, you acted like an ass and embarassed me”. Now I can admit I went too far with that poke in the arm but was I really the Ass?",False,False
1,"AITA for insisting my friend not basically have her tits on display all weekend at Stagecoach festival? | So as most of you know this weekend is Stagecoach in Indio. It’s a huge country music festival and is so much fun. I’ve had a miserable year and have basically been counting on this as a way to turn things around and get happy again.

I’m 32 and I came with some friends from work who are a bit younger than me. Last night we went to the shows and the youngest one basically wore the lowest cut top I’ve ever seen without a bra you could essentially see her entire boob and if she moved right her nipples popped out. I asked her if she knew that and she said “I’m trying to get back stage! Wooooo.” I told her that this isn’t Coachella and during certain shows there might be kids and families. She literally took another shot and ignored me. 

I sent a group text out that maybe we needed to have a chat about what is and isn’t approriate for our group and said “having your tits on a platter just isn’t cool.” Apparently this offended most everyone because they ditched me and I had to walk to the show by myself. At the end of the night I caught up with them and they said I needed to steer clear of them for the whole weekend (we also had a minor argument on the drive up over gas money) and they would make sure I got back to Albuquerque but they didn’t want anything to do with me. So this really sucks. I do have a friend that is driving down from Vegas so I won’t be totally alone and I’m thinking about driving back with him and just flying home on Monday.



I honestly don’t think I did anything wrong but since the whole trip has broken down and I’m in an awkward Airbnb right now with people who aren’t speaking to me, am I the asshole?",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting to play videogames with my boyfriend anymore? | My boyfriend has always been into competitive games and loves playing challenging games that takes time and patience. I used to be competitive back when I was in my late teens but quit due to work and having a kid from a previous relationship so I kinda stopped playing multiplayer/coop games and stayed with single player games for the last few years.

We've recently bought a few coop games on steam so that we could play together. I'm more of a casual player so I just want to play without all the stress. He, however, wants to turn up the difficulty straight off the bat eventhough we're new to the game and it just made a lot of things harder for me. He was doing well and of course, I was doing bad and kept dying. Instead of having fun, I was just super annoyed the whole time because we were practically being carried the whole game by higher level players.

I told him he can keep playing the game at a higher difficulty but that I would rather just play at lower difficulty till I get used to the game. Then he starts telling me that it's fun and it would help me learn faster if we played higher difficulty, and that he'd have my back anyways. I've kind of lost interest at this point because we've tried all the new games we bought and everytime he would  increase the difficulty. I told him I'd rather go back to singleplayer games or play these on my own. He got upset and told me that I didn't wanna spend time and would rather do my own thing. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for 'pointing out' to the coffee barista that she didn't charge my good looking friend, and subsequently making him pay? | TLDR - I (22 male) am best friends with John (not real name), who is also 22 male. Now here's the thing, he is incredibly good looking. He's 6''5, muscular and has the face of a greek god. Obviously he gets a lot of attention from girls, and it's not uncommon for servers (usually female ones) to reduce prices on things for him (e.g. drinks, food, etc) or just sometimes not charge him at all.

Well this time we went for a coffee and I ordered a coffee and brownie. I pay for it. Fair game. But then John goes to order the same thing after me. The barista is giggling and flirting hard with him, but what grates me is that she charged him for the coffee but not the brownie. She winked at him and at that point I just saw how unfair it was that I got charged and he didn't, I don't want to sound jealous, but why should I have to pay and he doesn't? 

So I interrupt and say ''Excuse me, you didn't charge him for the brownie''

She looks startled and says ''I'm sorry what?'' so I look her in the eye and tell her ''You didn't charge him. Why not?''. She looks embarrassed and says ''Sorry you're right'' and subsequently charges him.

I'm not the type to say ''Can I speak to your manager please'', and I'm happy that my friend John got a date with that same girl, but I just wasn't going to let him get away with that free brownie whereas I had to pay. John was a bit pissed tho and called me an asshole, AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA For pushing a kid on crutches over? (Serious) | A few years back I got stuck behind a kid on crutches on the way to class (hall was crowded and narrow, couldn’t go around) I typically wouldn’t have said anything, but this was a kid who I’d known for many years, and we mutually disliked each other very much. 


I wasn’t gonna do anything at first, but he had been going so slow, to the point where I was about to be late for class. So I simply told him to hurry up. He responds by turning around and hitting me with the crutch. At this point I’m late, hurting and angry, so I push him over. Nothing too hard, but he falls. Am I the asshole?",False,False
1,"AITA for using language practice as an excuse to chat up girls I don't know? | Changed a few details but I think the gist stays the same

I recently met up with a female friend. We also talked about dating and she mentioned how she'd been using Tinder and that she found it was easy to get matches but actually finding a good partner on it so far proved to be difficult. She then wanted to know what my experience with it was and I told her I didn't really use it. So what did I do then to meet girls, she asked.

I mentioned a few things and I also said that I'd started to talk to attractive Asian girls (since I have a bit of a thing for them anyway), who I presumed were Chinese (somewhat of a decent number in the city we're at), also asking if they spoke Chinese and then mentioning that I'd learned the language for a almost three years in college (I did) but that it was difficult to get actual practice now since I didn't really know many Chinese people. And later I'd ask if I could add her on WhatsApp since even writing with someone could be useful. After writing a bit some time later I might ask her if she'd sometime like to get coffee together, and so on.

This actually doesn't work that badly, only issue is that it doesn't work with Korean women, and you actually have to speak the language. But it's better than just talking to them for no reason, way better success rate. 

However my friend didn't seem to like my approach much. She argued it was insincere of me to claim it was for getting language practise when I was just trying to get with them. I tried to explain to her how being too direct wouldn't be good and that I of course also saw the additional practice as beneficial for myself but she argued that I should rather be honest and that if I was actually interested in the language I would also talk to Chinese guys or Asian girls who I didn't think were hot.

About a month later, it finally arrives and my son-in-law and I get ready to assemble it. I ask her to show me where she wants it, and we decide on a fairly level piece of ground. I will need to Rototill and level it, then build the garden, looking at a long day of physical labor for this old fat man.

I'm already annoyed that I've wasted over 2 hours in the morning trying to pick up the rototiller I reserved online that no one can find even though their website showed 2 in stock. Ended up having to drive half an hour to another store, with 100 people in line to get in. Fortunately I was able to show the Gate Keeper the transferred pick up order and thy got it to me in 10 minutes.

Back home, already past noon, finish assembling the rototiller...

Ask the wife to show me how she wants the garden situated, where she wants to be able to enter...

ZW: ""OK, show me where you want the door""

Wife: ""I want the corner to be over here...""

ZW: ""The corners don't matter, tell me which side you want the door on and I can lay it out.""

Wife: ""But I want the corners to be...""

ZW: ""The corners DO NOT MATTER, what matters is where you want the door so I can lay it out.""

Wife: ""You don't understand, I need the corners to be...""

ZW: ""For the last fucking time, it DOES. NOT. MATTER. Where you want the corner, it is all built around the door. The door is the critical component. Just show me which direction you want the God Damn door!""

A Wild Daughter appears to defend her Mother

Daughter: ""DAD! Not everyone thinks like you, she's trying to tell you how she wants it...""

ZW: ""This is not rocket science, if she shows me where she wants the door, the rest will fall into place. All I NEED is to know is where she wants the door!""

Mother/Daughter team up on ZW about him being unreasonable and not listening

ZW: (Steam coming out of ears) ""Which part of show me where the fucking door needs to go is so hard to understand?

By the time they get back, the area has been tilled, all the pieces have been laid out, my Son-in-Law has placated the 3 & 6 y.o. to the point he can actually help work on the garden and much progress has been made.

Last week she made a big announcement at a family meetup: she's pregnant. Everyone got excited and congratulated her. I was pretty shocked and didn't even cheer. A bit later I asked her ""so hope you don't mind if I ask this but did you use any sort of special fertility treatments?"" And she was like ""nooooo....why you ask?""

We are also storing a lot of stuff in the basement for my mom. My brother’s lease is up, and he had to declare bankruptcy a few months ago so he can’t rent another place. And he has been arrested multiple times for the reason he bankrupted. Everyone says they have to move in with me. Wtf? My dad, who I never talk to, called me and suggested that me and my girlfriend move out of our own house and rent an apartment so they could here!! I couldn’t believe it. I would do anything for them, and we’ve done so much already, you wouldn’t even believe it. This is ridiculous. My mom said that there isn’t another option and that they have to move in with me and they will be out in a month. I doubt it so hard. Idk. My dad’s house is pretty big but he doesn’t want to bothered I’m sure. My mom lives with her boyfriend who shares the house with a roommate so that’s not an option. I love my nephews and couldn’t bear them being homeless, but I’m really sick of the bs I always have to deal with from my brother, who I love dearly (we’re twins). I wish they would just apply to section 8 or something. Anything. But they don’t want any “handouts”. Except from family. They are all messy and loud, and don’t respect my stuff. I’m not even materialistic.

0,"AITA for not adhering to my boyfriend's OCD rules? | My boyfriend was my best friend growing up and he's always showed OCD traits, but has never gotten a formal diagnosis. I am not being an armchair psychologist when I say he has OCD - pretty much everyone who has spent an extended amount of time with him has agreed that he has it. He is deathly afraid of germs and getting sick and even the word ""vomit"" makes him sick. I've tried encouraging him to get help but he puts it off.

He owns his own apartment which has two bathrooms. I stay there a few nights a week, but usually me staying there comes with rules. Most of the rules are easy to follow, usually simple things like shower before getting into his bed or leaving my shoes near the front the door.

However, the reason I'm posting about this, is he has a dumb rule. One bathroom is for peeing, and the other is for pooping. The bathroom in the masterbedroom is the one where we can pee, and the other is for poop. He says it's because it puts him further away when he is in his room. 

The other night I had came over after eating burritos, and woke up to the worst stomachache of my life. Suddenly I had to go, and I just skipped over to the masterbath to relieve myself and, of course, that included going number two. Somehow he had woken up while getting out of bed and he noticed I'd been there for a while. When I came out, he asked if I pooped, and when I said yes he got really frustrated and told me that was the one rule he really didn't want me to break (it's also where he keeps his toothbrush, and now claims he has to get a whole new one). I told him it was ridiculous and I really had to go, and he replied that it was his place and brought up the fact that I don't pay the bills there. That part kind of hurt, because I am in-between jobs and he knows that.

Eventually I just packed my stuff up and went home where I can use the bathroom freely. I tried texting him about that night but he insists he wasn't in the wrong somehow. Was I the asshole?",False,False
1,"AITA for giving my fiance’s brother the same birthday gift that I got for my fiancé? | My fiancé James and his twin brother Jack celebrated their birthday recently and I got the two of them the same gift: dive watches with their name engraved on it. I gave my gifts to them separately, James got his gift first at our house while I gave Jack his gift later when we all met at their parents’ house for lunch. 

James was very happy when he opened his gift that morning but he got all quiet after he saw me give my gift to Jack. Jack didn’t open it there but when we got home James asked me if I also gave Jack a dive watch. I said yes. James was disappointed and said that he’s sorry but he can’t help but feel that his gift is not as special after finding out that I spent the same considerable amount of money to buy the watch and the same effort to personalize it for Jack. 

I told him that of course that wasn’t my intention, I just don’t think that giving the same gift to two people should mean that you put the same value on them. I love James in a way that I will never love Jack even though Jack and I are close and have been friends for longer than I’ve been with James. I got them the same gift because I thought that both of them would like it, that’s all.

0,"AITA for not honoring my dad’s dying request to let everyone know that my cousin is actually his child? | My dad died a few weeks ago. On his deathbed he told me that my cousin Lauren, the daughter of my father’s brother James, is actually my half-sister as the product of an affair between my dad and Uncle James’ wife Alice. 

I won’t go into details to minimize the risk of being identified, but apparently Uncle James, Aunt Alice and my dad all knew the truth. My dad wanted to acknowledge Lauren as his child but Aunt Alice wanted to keep the affair a secret and raise Lauren as her and Uncle James’ child. My dad agreed to what Aunt Alice wanted because he loved her, and initially he was going to let the truth die with him (Uncle James and Aunt Alice passed away a few years ago) but on his deathbed he had a change of heart. He said that he wanted to finally be able to acknowledge Lauren and leave her with the same inheritance that my siblings and I will get. 

I was shocked because I always thought my parents had a happy marriage and I was gutted that my dad cheated on my mom. I didn’t say anything after he died because part of me was angry that he cheated, and for all that he talked about wanting to finally be a dad to Lauren, he didn’t even have the decency to admit the truth to everyone himself. Instead he left it to me to deal with everything after he was, conveniently for him, dead. I also didn’t want to burden my mom with the grief of knowing that her ‘perfect husband’ cheated on her and would have left her for his sister-in-law if Aunt Alice hadn’t told him that they should stay with their families. 

The only thing I feel guilty about is that I know Lauren is entitled to inherit from my dad who left a sizable estate. But it’s not like she’s being cheated out of money that she desperately needs because Uncle James and Aunt Alice were well-off themselves and Lauren got almost everything when they died. 

I’ve been keeping this all to myself for the past weeks because I can’t tell anyone I know in real life. But I want to know what other people think. Maybe I just need to get this off of my chest, maybe I want validation… but yeah I want to know what you guys think.",False,False
0,"AITA for asking my boyfriend not to surprise me? | So this literally just happened/is happening.  For context, we're both males if that makes any difference.

My boyfriend is the type of guy who likes to do surprises.  Now I've no issue with being bought a surprise gift or having a surprise dinner made for me or anything like that, but I do have an issue when it comes to a surprise that involves a trip away/night away/holiday/weekend break or anything of that sort.

Backstory as to why this is an issue.  A few years ago I was diagnosed officially with epilepsy, 

Around a year after this had happened, after struggling through severe daily anxiety, not sleeping, eating properly waking up every morning and being physically sick because I had to leave the house I was signed off work.  I was then diagnosed with severe GAD, PTSD (From the seizures) and agoraphobia.  I didn't want to be left alone and I didn't want to leave the house, I was signed off for a year, put on meds, had therapy and eventually got hypnotherapy which got me back to work in December 2017.  2018 was pretty good, I've improved so much, got back to work, got a promotion, I still had anxiety, still don't really like being out but most days its bearable and I've learned how to cope.  One thing I don't cope very well with is new places, my own town/city I'm cool with because I know where I am and it's just that comfort.  

I've told this to my boyfriend multiple times, please let me know if he wants to ""surprise"" me with a trip away or something because chances are I'll need to prepare myself.

So I get a call just now asking if I'm okay to do something monday night, I'm like, what? He says he's not telling me and I'm like well if you don't tell me what I'm not going to agree to it.  And he just huffs off the phone saying ""it doesn't matter"".

&#x200B;

I text him and ask him to please tell me what he wanted to do, he tells me and said he booked a nice hotel away for the night on Monday, and although this is super sweet of him to do he KNOWS that it's an issue to me and I really cannot afford to relapse.  I text him back reminding what I've said before and I appreciate the sentiment.  He just says ""It's not that far away, I'm going to lose the deposit now but doesn't matter"".  

&#x200B;

I feel like shit now but why should I have to feel like shit when I've asked so many times?! Just because outwardly I may appear to be doing OK, he knows what's going on inside and knows I still wouldn't be comfortable with it.

0,"AITA for putting my single best friends before my married ones all the time? | I am 45F and I live next door to my two best friends. We deliberately bought land adjacent to each other 10 years ago because we were sick of being chronically single and being lonely. (our properties are in a triangle)

We've since knocked down the fences on our properties so it's 3 houses with a huge garden in the middle which has a vegetable patch and a garden. We even have a small greenhouse and chickens, 2 dogs and a cat who wander around.

I consider my friends to be my family basically and it's been really nice over the last few years to have my own house but also have people to do activities with, buy stuff in bulk, go travelling etc and just have a good time. We also help each other out a lot eg if I'm working from home, I can handle the repair man or sign for parcels, have someone to drive me to the doctor and bring me food when I'm sick and vice versa but also have my own space in my house.

There are memes out there about how you need 1 person with a Netflix account, 1 person with Hulu and another with Amazon Prime but that's basically our life.

My married friend got annoyed at me the other day though because if she wants to make plans, ask a favor etc I always tell her ""let me check I'm not doing anything with Alice & Claire"" or ""I need to check with Alice & Claire, I think we had plans for that"".

However I don't see what the problem with that is because she's always telling me ""let me check with Bob"" (her husband) or she'll only meet me if Bob is free.

If she's expected to put her husband first before her friends, then what's wrong with me saying I need to put my friends who I essentially live with and share most of my life with?

I've had other married friends complain about this too. But I never begrudge them when they have to put their husbands first. Another example is cancelling plans with me if their spouse is sick- that's super reasonable but for some reason it's unreasonable for me to cancel plans with them if say Alice is sick and Claire can't take her to the doctors.

This latest blow up was over travel plans. My best friends and I are planning to travel to Morocco this year for two weeks. My married friend and I made plans to go to Morocco YEARS ago (20 years ago to be precise) and then she met her current husband we just never went but I've always wanted to go. I didn't think she'd still want to go but she obviously does.

However, it sounds bad but I don't want to invite her either and nether do Alice and Claire, they aren't that close with my married friend and to be honest we just wanted to chill and talk through some renovations and plumbing that we want done on the property in the evenings.

Also my married friend travels all the time with her husband and doesn't invite me, but now she's calling me an asshole for going on our ""dream destination"" with Alice and Claire and not inviting her and for generally always putting Alice and Claire before her.

1,"AITA for sleeping over at my gfs 4 nights a week making her roommate uncomfortable and causing her to flip out? | Let me preface this by saying that I (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call Liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. I've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. This is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. I'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.

Now, I've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. Her beds bigger for starters and I cant cook at home because it's always congested, so Liv and I cook a meal twice a week at hers. She has a roommate who we'll call (Bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. I've tried my best to get to know Bianca but it's not reciprocated and I can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. She's never asked a question about what I do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.

Liv told me that Bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. I hate being the cause of her discomfort. Whenever I'm at Livs house, I don't use the living room and go straight to Livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). Besides cooking with Liv, I'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.

Here's where Liv and I may have screwed up. We were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). All of a sudden Bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends Liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. 
We both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.

Their relationships gone down the gutters since I came along and I can't help but feel responsible. 

On an end note, Liv and I want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.

My mates telling me I'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and I should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. But I see it as the next step before moving in together, that I'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in. So AITA?",False,False
1,"WIBTA for planting a garden to annoy my annoying neighbor? | 
I have an elderly neighbor who is a pain.  He yells at my cats for stepping on his lawn.  He yells at my guests for parking in front of my house.  He blows leaves from his yard into my yard so I have to pick them up.  He is a sour, unpleasant old man.

He is also a fanatic about his lawn.  He picks up stray leaves one by one.  He sprays it with chemicals all the time.  He mows it within an inch of its life.

WIBTA if I planted several large mint plants on my side of our property line, right up against his precious lawn, knowing the mint would surely spread all over the place?

0,"AITA for technically stealing my neighbor's cat? | OK, I'l try to shorten the story so it's digestible... 

Basically, there's this cat. He ""lives"" a few houses up... I didn't even learn this until a couple weeks ago. The cat, who I named Robert, has been waiting for me at my door for the last three months. He stays by my place, waits by my door. He's always happy to come inside, eat, chill, sleep. 

 I get home very very late. Midnight is early for me. 2am is more realistic. Robert is declawed, so he has no natural defense. He is very old, frail, milky old eyes, clearly ""elderly.""  I'd estimate he's at least 13? He can barely jump up to the couch.

He was covered in scabs. Mange. Fleas. I Capstar'd his ass immediately, with followup Advantage. I've been picking scabs for at least a month, and I'm still only about 75% done, he was beat up, nasty, scabby, gross.

There's no reason an elderly declawed kitty should be out that late. Also, the ""home"" of the cat is home to four dogs, and they have an entirely fenced yard. Rob can't even jump up over it. It might be the dogs that were beating him up, it might be the local feral cats, who knows...

All I know is this cat picked me, I let him in, and he looks 200% healthier since I've been picking and brushing his gross fur. He loves me. He spoons on the couch. 

My other neighbor said the ""owner"" of the cat was crying on Facebook about the lost cat. Asking me if i'd seen it... I confided in her that I basically took the cat. Other neighbor said ""good job, It's out secret"" after seeing how clean Robert looks now.

TLDR: I stole someone's terribly neglected, underfed, elderly, gross cat. He chose to be here. He is very affectionate. He lets me pick scabs and brush him back to healthy. I'm keeping him.",False,False
1,"AITA for just being myself? | I'm (23M) British and have lived all my life in the UK up until recently, and I'd consider myself to be your typical Brit. I've always lived my life the way I've felt comfortable with and I try to stay true to myself.  

My humour and personality is very 'British', I make awful, dark jokes, I'll offend you, myself, everyone. Always joking and it's blatantly obvious but I'm serious and professional when I need to be, I support my friends no matter what, even if I constantly insult them. Almost everyone I know is like this, and I've lived in two different cities and been to uni so I know a wide variety of people. Never had any problem with it, I'm always open and honest about who I am. I've always thought this was perfectly normal. Almost everyone I would consider an acquaintance; male or female, young or old is more or less the same.

I moved to the US 3 months ago for work on a 12-month contract with the option to extend it to permanent. I understand that the cultural differences are huge, but I just feel like I don't fit in at all. Everyone's so fucking nice and fake and woke. I'm young so for me the most important thing is to have fun and have a laugh. I can't do this here, the sense of humour is so shit and childish and unfunny. At first, I didn't really change my personality until I realised calling people cunts in a friendly manner within 10 minutes of meeting them isn't acceptable here, but that's fair enough, cultural differences and whatnot so I changed. I toned it down a lot but I still struggle to fit in, whether it's with colleagues or friends.

I've made acquaintances with my flatmates' mates and about 10 of us were out for a drink and although I've toned my personality down so much, some of them pulled me up and said that they think I'm an AH and don't enjoy my company or my personality. A few others agreed and I feel shit now. My flatmates quite like my personality and said they far prefer the way I am to some of their other friends. One of them works with me and is one of about 3 colleagues that actually likes me. 

I don't want to change who I am for other people, esp when I haven't had to before. I lost it at one of my colleagues yesterday after work who said 'yeah you're an AH and just can't be nice to people' because that's so untrue. My way of of being friendly and nice is by being a cunt, everyone back home knows that and are the same. I don't want to change who I am but I just feel I don't fit in - hardly anybody shares similar interests or humour. Americans can't drink so I can't even bond with people that way to maybe get them to see it's just who I am. Having seen how fake so many people are, I can guarantee I'm a more caring, loyal individual than most of them. They all love to talk the talk but at the end of the day, most of them are snakes anyway. 

I love my work and there's so so much more career potential for what I do in the US. I don't want to go back home but I feel I have to. Am I an AH for just being me?",False,False
0,"AITA for accidentally taking a machine at the gym? | About two weeks ago I was at the gym and was training back. I arrived and went to do lat pull downs, low rows, and straight leg dead lifts (all 4 x 10 sets), so I’ve been here for a solid 20 minutes already.

I knew I needed the cable machine for my next exercise (straight arm pull downs) and needed a straight bar to do the exercise. I knew I needed to do these when I walked in but wanted to do the others first, and for the entire time I was doing the preceding 3 exercises there has been a cable free but with a water bottle and towel next to it. The reason why I didn’t the cable earlier was because I was going to do another 2 exercises on them on top of the one I was planning on doing, and didn’t want to lose the cable just in case. If I did them one after the other then I could stay on it as long as I needed.

So I head over to the cable that has the towel and bottle (again, haven’t seen anyone use the cable for 20 or so minutes), and look around to catch anyone’s eyes to let me know it’s theirs. I wait for about 30secs to a minute and take off the rope attachment and attach the straight bar. A couple of guys ask me for the rope attachment and I give it to them, then I start doing my first set.

As soon as I finish the owner of the towel and bottle taps me on the shoulder and says “You do realise you just took my machine mate”, and I immediately apologised and tried to get the rope he was using but couldn’t find any left. I apologised again and explained I didn’t see anyone here and he was visibly mad. 

I explained to him that I haven’t seen anyone here using the cable for 20 mins, to which he explained he was on some other machine doing another set. He said “You should have asked around” and “A little gym etiquette goes a long way”. He walked off pissed and did something else on another machine, didn’t even want his machine back when I offered.

Don’t get me wrong here guys, I understand that I’ve outright taken someones machine at the gym - not cool. But WIBTA if I asked around and 3 (for example) people said they haven’t see anyone use the machine I want? WIBTA if I took his secondary machine that didn’t have his towel and bottle? Would I have to ask around for THAT machine?

Am I 100% in the wrong here? Where and how far does gym etiquette go for someone not occupying a machine for a noticeable amount of time? Also not sure if worth mentioning but this is my first gym etiquette/workout related incident, I try to be as civil as possible.

Much appreciated guys!

0,"AITA for not telling my friends, family, or girlfriend about my wealth? | Hey guys. 23/M here. Back in 2010, when I was in high school, I became interested in bitcoin and bought about $75 worth. Fast forward to today and... well it's worth quite a bit more. I've cashed out back in 2017 on most of it- about $12M worth after taxes. (I have about $2M still in bitcoin and plan on cashing out if the price spikes again).

I was in college when I decided to liquidate most of it. I felt on top of the world, but still wanted to graduate (I graduate this quarter), and on top of that, lead a fairly normal life. I've heard about how peoples' lives change because of the lottery, for example. Because of this, I have not told anyone about my investment gain. Not my mom, girlfriend, or any friends. I even keep a facade of being poor. I've grown up like that, and figured any big change in spending, etc. would raise some eyebrows. 

I met my girlfriend at the beginning of 2018, right after cashing out. We've been going out for over a year now. I plan on telling her whenever we move in together, but for now, she does not know.

Question is, AITA for this? I'm basically keeping a huge part of my life secret from everyone. On the other hand, I am not entirely stingy about my money. I've gotten my family and friends great (but reasonable) gifts, have loaned my mom money, etc. On the other hand, I am sometimes flat-out lying when I say I can't afford to do something, or when I joke about being poor.

1,"AITA For wanting to return my rescue dog? | So I adopted a dog recently. I was really excited about it because it gives my wife and I someone to love as we may never have children and our cat isn't affectionate at all. When I met the dog she seemed perfect. Calm, yet excited to be loved on. She came from an abusive home as most rescues do, and I wanted to save her. The first few days she was exactly as I thought she would be and enjoyed her presence in the home. The last couple days her personality is starting to show and she is very hyper and needs attention constantly or she whines like crazy. She bullies the cat even though in the shelter she interacted with cats quite well. I feel like she isn't a good fit for our family and I am considering returning her for another dog.

She's 19 now and a very controlling person. She gets mad at me for stupid shit like peeing a bit on the toilet seat, or forgetting to fill the brita water filter or leaving a single pot out in the night to be washed in the morning. She says that stuff is 'disrespectful' but it's so minor and I don't get why it bothers her so much and why she can't let things go. Shit happens in the real world you just gotta deal with.

Yesterday she was making dinner for her, my mom and my dad but I was doing something else. I went to put something in the oven and she said ""I needed that for anything."" I told her to just chill we can split the oven or she can wait 20 minutes. She got mad and I got fed up with her attitude and told her the world doesn't revolve around her. She scoffed and said the same back to me. I told her that her attitude was going to get her in trouble in the real world and she said 'think I'll be just fine, but thanks for the advice.'

She has a bad family situation where, long story short, her parents are incapacitated and unable to help her do anything. Over the past year, I’ve spent many, many hours working in their house which is fallen apart because of natural disasters. I’ve done everything I physically can for this girl and she’s abused it to the point that I’m expected to single handedly work and not question it. I spend hours and hours a day working on things for her and her parents, but in spite of that her family hates me because I’m an ‘asshole’ for questioning what she wants me to do. If I dump her straight out then it’ll cause lots of issues for me socially, making friends choose between her and I and whatever else, although that should be fine and I’m relocating for school in less than a year anyway. We recently had an argument because she went through my phone and found me venting about her to our mutual friends and I was given ‘one last chance’ to prove I’m not an asshole. Her family seems to believe I’m the problem, but anyone else I ask tells me to get the fuck out of this situation and that I’m not an asshole. What do I do, guys? Am I warped or is this truly a bad situation for me? Sorry for this long winded ass post, I just don’t know where to turn. This post only scratches the surface of the number of literal sleepless nights I spent helping her with something like packing or doing yard work.

I’ll go in depth with this story because it just happened: At about 9:30 PM last night, she calls me and says she needs my help doing yard work. Fine, whatever. Her parents are both in their sixties and drugged out, so who the fuck else is gonna do it? They have (had) one of those Intex inflatable pools you buy at Target that they let rot, and now it’s just an uninflated mess of water, mud, and sludge. I am expected to single handedly use a five gallon bucket with a vacuum on top to drain out all the water and mud, dumping it a specific place in their backyard, and then drag the pool out to their curb at 9:30 PM. My girlfriend has the balls to tell me that I have to do it myself because the pool is gross and she refuses to touch it, even with work gloves. She refuses to be of any help whatsoever to me, whether that be finding me any kind of tools or holding the pool filter, or anything in between.

0,"AITA for refusing to fully pay for my friend's phone screen to be replaced after I made her drop it? | I'm 19F and I've been friends with Kay since freshman year of college. Our second year started last month and over the summer, she cracked her phone screen really bad and when she first showed our friend group, she joked about how clumsy she is. Her phone had pieces missing from the screen and when someone recommended that she replace her screen before she hurt her finger, she said that she couldn't afford it yet. 

Last week, I was walking with Kay to grab dinner and I slipped, causing her to also fall and her phone to gain yet another crack.

She started crying and saying that her mom was going to be mad. I went to comfort her and I told her that because I added another crack to her phone, I could give her 50% of the cost right there. She got silent and didn't talk to me at all during dinner. 

Our friends told me the next day that she was mad at me and I mentioned that I offered to pay half for half of the screen so I'm not sure what she's mad about and she should just talk to me about any issues she's having.

After giving me the silent treatment, she finally responded to me (because I was trying to meet her at a local shop for an estimate) and told me she wants me to pay for the entire screen. I think that's absolutely ridiculous because she already had destroyed her phone to the point where pieces had fallen off and was making jokes about it. 

&#x200B;

I'm also a bit miffed at the silent treatment and the gossip because I immediately offered to pay half although I only added one crack to a sea of 20+. And why not just tell me at dinner she wanted me to pay for the entire thing. I would have said no but I did nothing to deserve to be treated this way.

Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. 

She feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition.

1,"WIBTA if I told my (43f) friend (50f) she employs a convicted felon (43m)? |  I've been sitting on this for a couple of weeks now and I'm really torn on what the right thing to do is.

The felon is my ex, Mark. Mark works as a sous chef at my friend’s restaurant.

I dated Mark for a couple years, starting when we were 15, we were each others firsts and he ghosted me when I told him I was pregnant with our daughter (27). The last I heard of him was when his mom told me he was in prison; this was around 20 years ago. Fast forward to now, I've been married for the last 12 years, have a 11f and 8m, I have a well-paying job that I love and my daughter is engaged to a wonderful young man. Neither my husband or I have any family around anymore so we are still really close to Mark's family.

So my friend took a day off from work and wanted to try out her own restaurant, she invited me and a couple other of our friends along. We had a great time at the restaurant and when service had calmed down a little the sous chef (Mark) personally came out to take our dessert orders. He looked pretty much the same, except for a beard and a buzzed head.

What rubbed me the wrong way was that he introduced himself with a different name. I think he may be impersonating someone else. I've only told my husband about the incident, who thinks that I should stay out of it.

Between his retirement and his off the books jobs he has never not had a decent income. He has no bills to speak of other than his car insurance and he doesn't pay rent anywhere, he just goes from place to place. He also gambles excessively. This is relevant IMO because I want it to be clear that I didn't screw over some broke old guy that needed help. 

He found out that all of his friends get SNAP / food stamps /whatever and he felt that he needed to also because he was ""entitled to it."" - He didn't have any living expenses so this halted his application process. He informed me that he would be saying that he pays me rent and lives in my house which he does not. I told him that I was not comfortable with this as it was fraud and also rent is taxable income so his scheme would be costing me money. He told me that if I didn't comply he would fill out and sign the forms for me.

1,"AITA for not changing my behaviour or making accomodations for my girlfriend? | My gf of three years has some pretty bad anxiety around weird and specific things, and I feel like I shouldn't have to change my way of life to accomodate them. She is on medication for her anxiety, and she does work through her issues slowly, but when one thing is resolved it seems like another just pops up. 

Some things she has anxiety about that affect me include:

* anxiety surrounding food: she doesn't like to eat in front of me (she had ednos in the past and now has some left over anxiety) so if I eat before I get home and don't stop to tell her, she probably won't eat a full meal and will just snack. 
* she clams up when we go to my parent's house and food is involved: my parents will always cook for me if I go home to visit them with her, but she is vegetarian and they don't cook vegetarian. this links back to the first point, as this means she won't eat anything at my parent's house if I eat there. 
* she gets upset if I don't tell her I'm going out: sometimes I go for a beer with my friends for a few hours after work without telling her, and she says she's worried. I think this is really dramatic. 
* she gets anxious when I don't tell her the full details of plans: we have the same friend group but I often make the plans because she gets nervous asserting herself, and she gets anxious if I don't tell her every little detail. 

She argues that it would be 'easy' for me to accomodate these changes. She argues with the first two points that if I just texted her I was gonna eat before I got home, she could sort herself out. I think this is dramatic, I don't want to have to stop driving for a few minutes to text her during rush hour before I get my food. With the second point she says I could let her know beforehand if I'm gonna eat there, or tell my parents that we're gonna eat after. I think this is dumb, because I don't know when I'm going to be hungry, and it's not my fault my parents won't cook vegetarian. 

I find her last two points just controlling. I don't get why she has to know everything. She says that she doesn't get why it matters, because it would make literally no difference to me for me to tell her I was going out. I think this is dramatic, sometimes I just want to hang out without worrying. Sometimes I don't tell her things just because they'll make her nervous, but then she finds out and just gets upset.

0,"AITA for firing an employee who just found out last week that his wife is expecting their fifth child? | I hire and fire employees all the time, but this one is sticking with me. I let someone go today who just found out that his wife is expecting their fifth child; they have 4 kids under 7.  His wife is a SAHM. He was hired less than 90 days ago so he was still on probation. He was hired to be the employee responsible for our company supply room. His primary responsibility was to take and deliver orders to departments, stock shelves, inventory and reorder supplies. Not the most vital job in our company, but depended on by many departments. 

The employee was frequently 15-30 minutes late to work (13 out of the last 20 days, including today) and would usually use the drop off lines at his oldest kid’s school as the reason, or that his wife had an appointment that ran over and he had to stay home with the kids until she got back.  The only reason why I know his wife just found out she was pregnant was because I verbally addressed the tardiness with him last week, and he said that day he was late because he and his wife had an appointment to find out if she was. He was so excited to share the news. 

He was also reportedly receiving 2-3 personal phone calls each shift through our system, all from his wife (cell phones aren’t allowed; employees leave them in a locker room and can check them during breaks and lunch). I only know this because our receptionist complained about the frequency this week. Apparently the wife would keep calling back if the receptionist was on the other line, and the wife would hang up and call back again if it took more than 30 seconds for the receptionist to track him down in the building. 

The employee was keeping up with his work, so we didn’t think his tardiness and time on the phone was an issue, until a few nights ago. Apparently he was struggling to keep up so he and his two oldest kids would come in after hours to help him catch up on his duties. We were not aware this was happening until we watched security tapes to find out who propped the main office door open two nights ago. He was not clocking in to do this, explaining to me today that this job was everything to his family and that it would be devastating to lose their only source of income.  He propped the door open so his kids could get in – they had been closing the door behind them but this one instance they forgot and the security discovered it. 

When I let him go, he was in tears. I had scheduled a meeting with him this morning to address the phone calls and his continue tardiness; this was supposed to be his written warning meeting. However, leaving the door propped open is an unforgivable offense. I also wasn’t really sure how I was going to address his children in the workplace, doing his work. I’ve never had that happen before. And then the not clocking in piece.  

Should I have let him off easier? Should I have advocated for him to get another chance? Or am I asshole status?",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I spent my money before my mother gets to it? | I apologize in advance if this is messy, I’ve never posted in this sub before.

Okay, so, a little bit of backstory. My parents got divorced when I was really young, around 3 or so, after the divorce, my mom got remarried and didn’t really give two shits about my father. My dad died when I was 11, and I’ve been getting survivor benefits since then. I was able to get my own bank account last April when I was 17, but I had to have my mom on the account as well, since I was underage. 

After I turned 18, my survivor benefits started getting directly deposited into my account, instead of my mother’s. I didn’t realize this until a month or two later because my mom was taking all of it out.

When I asked her about it, she said that I was basically “paying rent” and that my survivor benefits were being used to take care of me.

Here’s some more backstory — my mother doesn’t give a shit about me. My mother has been abusing my sister (16) and I for years, my mom does not take care of us, and when she does, we have to BEG her to. I buy my own clothes, food, etc, I try to take up the least amount of resources in the house. My mom also doesn’t care that I’m still grieving my father, she says I need to move on and “get over it” despite my PTSD worsening from my father’s death.

My sister and I’s survivor benefits were used to fund my mother’s 3rd wedding and honeymoon back in December. We both get around $1000 a month and my mom takes all of it from both of us. 

I cannot work during the school year due to chronic illness and autism. I cannot apply for disability at the moment because of everything going on in the world right now. I graduate in a month and this will be the second to last time I get paid before I can actually apply for disability, but my mom will take all of that as well.

I got paid this morning, my mother hasn’t woken up yet, all my money is in my bank account.

I’m not worried about spending all of it in one day and needing it later in the month, I’m more worried about what my mother will do to me if I spend any of it at all.

0,"AITA for disciplining and shoving an aggressive dog in a public space? | I look after a 9 year-old girl from time to time with severe birth defects to her legs and spine. She is forced to use a wheelchair every day... lets call her Lacy. I am a family friend, and not an official caregiver, but i've been taking her out for walks and ice cream on Saturdays while her siblings are at camp on the west coast and her parents work their business. 

She does great, and i rarely need to help her along the pathways or off the curbs when we are out and about. However, often we will walk through public parks and she is scared of dogs... but is completely fine if they are on a lead and the owners are present to restrain them.

On this Saturday we were lined up outside of a very popular ice cream shop. It was extremely busy and has an outdoor service window so people can order outside instead of going in. We were lined up with a bunch of people who had dogs and Lacy was fine. However, a few minutes later someone lined up behind us, the girl that ended up behind us had a very aggressive terrier. I am not at all bothered by dogs, well behaved or not... but I could tell Lacy was getting anxious and her hands were getting sweaty. For some reason the dog was taking a special interest in the wheelchair, and not a pleasant one. He kept barking incessantly at Lacy and grabbed a hold of my jeans with his teeth when i stepped between him and Lacy as a barrier. He was gnawing away at the wheels and i would gently brush him off. Lacy was actively trying to move away from the dog, but as she moved up, the girl behind us moved up too, while still paying absolutely zero attention to the dogs behaviour and chatting to her friend.

Eventually I tried to get the girls attention, as she was deep in conversation and clearly used to tuning out the barking and growling. Instead of looking at me when i said ""excuse me..."", she just held up a finger, as if to say ""one second"", and then proceeded to keep on talking. It was such a rude gesture that my ears actually burned with fury. I pushed Lacy up a bit further and then the guys in front of us asked us ""is that dog bothering her?"" and just as i was about to answer the terrier jumped up and nipped at Lacys fingers and she screamed. Reflexively I swung around and grabbed the dog by its abdomen as it was just about to jump and pushed it away, probably a little more aggressively than i should have  (it fell over).... while nearly spluttering

“NO!!! SIT!!!”

The dog immediately sat. and whined... Nearly everyone in line stopped talking and watched.

The owner absolutely lost her shit with me, and told me I had no right to touch or handle her dog. Her friend absolutely lost it too and called me an animal abuser.

We managed to get our ice cream and unfortunately just threw mine out because Lacy was so shaken and I felt so sick.",False,False

I am still in the first trimester, and I've miscarried before, so I feel it is still too early to tell people, But I needed someone to talk about it to, so I tell my friend. I explained to her we were not telling people so please keep it quiet. She knows my past. I get a notification on Facebook that she has tagged me in a pregnancy post. After I had asked her to keep it quiet. (Note: this is less than 2 days after I tell her)  I told her to delete it and she did, saying she didn't think it was a big deal, and she didnt think about it.(since it was about helping my morning sickness) with no apology.

1,"AITA for dumping food on my girlfriends plate at a wedding until it was overflowing? | Me and my girlfriend are moderately overweight. We have been noticing that we were getting fatter still, so I pushed us to try and lose some weight. We now go on walks everyday, we cut the sugar and generally try to eat better and in reasonable quantities. This is being tougher on her because she really enjoys eating until she's full. I'm mainly the one trying to keep us on track and very often I have to call her out when she's sliding back into our old eating habits.

So this last weekend we went to a wedding together as guests. We were sitting next to each other, together with family members from both our families, all in the same table. Every table had its own food so everyone could just serve themselves. So what happened next was I had to watch as my girlfriend filled her plate up with all kinds of delicious food. I kinda gave her a look like that, but she just shrugged it off as if to say ""yeah I know, but we're at a wedding"". I was slightly annoyed with her behavior but sort of forgot about it and tried to just enjoy everyone's companies. Some time after that, when she was finished, she was out for more. She asked me to pass her this big plate of shrimp rice so that she could try some of that. That really struck me, but I didn't want to argue right there and then, so what I did was get the srino rice and proceed to fill her plate up until it was literally overflowing a little bit.

She just kind of stared at it, then got up and went outside alone. Everyone was staring at me at this point and I thought it was better I just went outside too to talk to her. She told me she was humiliated and that I stepped out of line and they I came off as a controlling jerk.

So, am I the asshole for taking a stand against her completely disregard for our agreed upon diet? ",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my aunt it is her and my uncle’s fault that my cousin has high blood pressure at age fourteen? | Okay, long story short, almost two years ago now, my cousin started having really bad headaches and some shortness of breath. When she started having nosebleeds, my aunt took her to the doctor. He said she was likely developing high blood pressure, and (I’m guessing after asking about her diet) he basically said “cut down on these foods, and she’ll be fine.” 

My aunt did not. They kept eating the same things; a greasy sausage or breaded chicken biscuit with a Coke for breakfast (my cousin is finishing it when my uncle drops her off at school), cheese sticks and/or nachos with a Coke from the concessions for lunch, a Coke and a hotdog or pizza slice going home, and then apparently something like fried chicken cheeseburgers with mashed potatoes dripping in butter and filled with bacon bits and, you guessed it, another Coke. On Sundays, they go to the local diner for breakfast which offered two breakfast options: biscuits and gravy with sausage or pancakes soaked with butter and drowning in syrup with a side of sausage. 

A lot of my relatives have tried to offer up recipes or easy swaps to my aunt. She tried making a lentil soup once, decided that chopping and sautéing the vegetables was too much work, and made a Hamburger Helper instead. She laughing told us this story about a week later when the aunt who gave her the recipe asked how she liked it. 

-Before y’all ask, whenever we have a family get-together, we always have a couple of healthy choices, but my cousin refused to try most. 

About three or four months ago, the doctor tried to send my cousin to a dietitian because she’s getting worse. He really didn’t want to put her on blood pressure medicine if it could be helped since she is young. My aunt and cousin just didn’t go to the appointment. 

Now, my cousin was put on blood pressure meds yesterday, and my abs uncle were in tears. What did they do wrong? Did they fail my cousin as parents? And finally, I broke. Yes, y’all’re the only ones at fault here. Yes, you kriffed up. Yes, you’re bad parents for thinking that chopping a carrot was too much work for your kid’s health. 

And, I mean, I know they were at a low point and probably didn’t need to hear that, but my cousin already has a completely preventable disease, and her younger brother is starting to show the same symptoms, and I just can’t take it. 

My aunt gave my mom a really nasty call this morning, though, and now that part of the family isn’t coming to “any family event (I) will be at for a long time,” and I kind of feel bad. Did I overstep?",False,False

We’ve in fact been married several months for legal and financial reasons, so the wedding is primarily so everyone can feel included and have fun.

We’re not planning to invite too many people to begin with – we’re paying for everything – and are restricting our invites to engaged, cohabitating, and married couples only in order to save money. We’re also not allowing kids and are providing childcare instead. 

I’m not as close to my mom as I wish I were. If you’ve ever visited r/raisedbynarcissists, you’ll have a good idea of who she is. 

My mom has been dating a married man on and off for the better part of a year. I’ve been direct with her that dating someone who is married offends my personal ethics but otherwise, we try to avoid the discussion.

1,"AITA for refusing to speak Spanish to my coworkers? | A couple of coworkers of mine only speak Spanish, something I find very offensive and disrespectful if you plan on living in the US.

Anyway I do speak Spanish and have since I was a child, I grew up in a bilingual household. The thing is that I respect and love this country too much to not speak its correct tongue.

So at my new job a few people seem to only speak Spanish, and expect me to reply to them in Spanish IN the USA.
I told them, that they should learn English if they plan on being Americans. And if they can’t do that then they should see a ticket back to whatever country they belong in.
A few people didn’t like that and have since gone to straight up ignoring me. Work has felt weird now.

0,"AITA for not changing seats on a red eye flight for a Mum with three kids | I apologise in advance for any spelling or grammar mistakes.

So last night I was flying from LAX to Lima. This was my 2nd flight out of the three I had to take and I had been up since 5am as I had to catch a pretty early bus to get to the airport on time.

On top of getting up early the last couple of days I’ve been working overtime most days into early hours of the morning and not getting a whole lot of sleep due to conflicting work schedules with my room mates so I was running on very little sleep.

After finding my seat on the plane I see a family of 5 get on the plane (Mum, Dad and three boys under the age of 10 ) and pray that they won’t be sitting near me but they were.

I had specifically booked a window seat so I could rest against the window and sleep and for some reason the parents had booked the two aisle seats and the complete middle row so the kids could sit in middle and they would sit either side, but the rows weren’t lined up exactly so the mum and dad were slightly in front of the children and had to look back. 

I could hear the parents arguing and and knew it was coming the Mum turns to me and ask me if I’d mind moving to one of the aisle seats so it would be easier for them to sit together with one parent in the aisle and one kid next to the parents in my seat.

I said I’d rather not because I was really tired and had specifically booked a window seat the mother explained and tried to ask again and I said if there were no other options I’d move they asked some other people to move but nobody else wanted move either.

She didn’t end up asking me again but she seemed pretty stressed out during the flight and    Ended up having to get up a lot 

AITA for not moving seats for a stressed out mum just because I wanted to sleep ?

Also I had extended family around that I hadn’t seen in a couple months. 

So my girlfriend shows up and she is dressed completely inappropriate for a young childs birthday party. She had on a tight revealing black tank top and a short pair of jean shorts. A couple of the guests who were outside were making comments to me about her appearance, I’m just like umm ya know I can’t have you coming in wearing this at this event. I demanded that she go home and change into something that’s more appropriate for this time. I was not trying to present a poor image to a bunch of guests.

0,"WIBTA If I brought up something that I know embarrasses my gf because she isn't following through? | A little over 2 months ago gf and I were hanging out at my apt drinking and she got beyond shitfaced.  She passed out hard and I went to bed soon after.  I woke up in the middle of the night and my ass and legs are soaked.  I jump out of bed and turn the light on and she didn't stir at all, she had pissed the bed.  I was able to get her up and get the blankets and sheets off and replace them with a couple extra comforters, but it was still nasty.

I could tell she was really embarrassed the next day and she kinda just bounced before I could say anything about it.  I figured she was pretty hung over so I'd give her some recovery time before I brought it up.  

The issue is I'm not working right now, I'm on disability.  I scrape by and replacing my mattress would take months and months of saving every extra cent.  She lives with her parents and works part time.  She has no bills.  I really feel like she should replace the mattress.

I tried being as understanding and non judgmental about it as possible.  These things happen, at the same time I need a new mattress.  I told her I was fine with the cheapest option she could find that would fit the box spring.  She was just kinda quiet and agreed to replace it. 

After about a month of sleeping on a bed that still reeks (febreeze and bleach have done almost nothing) I asked her if she's been able to save up enough to get the mattress soon.  She blew up at me and told me she said she'll buy one and that's what she's going to do, but I need to stop bringing up because it's humiliating.   I get that and I backed off on it.

Well it's over two months now and yesterday I saw on her fb selfies from the salon she goes to.  I know she spends well over $100 each trip there because one time she ""jokingly"" told me I should pay for her salon trips because she does it for me.  The only furniture I have in my apt is a couple folding chairs and my bed.  So I can't even sleep on a couch and wait for her to replace it.  It's gross.

I don't want to embarrass her, but I'm sick of having to smell it.  I feel like she's just ignoring the situation I'm pretty irked that she'd treat herself to an expensive salon visit and show it off on fb, while I'm still living with her piss smell every night. 

I know I agreed not to bring it up again, but she's not following through and I feel like she's not going to unless I push the issue again.",False,False

0,"AITA for refusing to take trainees at my work? | Throwaway and vagueness for reasons. 

I work in a very niche industry. I've been certified in my job & worked at the same employer for 12 years. My employer has a new(er) certification program for the certification level below mine - it works by 4 months of classroom training and 2 weeks of on-the-job training under a preceptor. 

I was one of the preceptors. 

I learned from a preceptee that an insane amount of my fuckups were recorded without my knowledge and included in various training videos. Other people are included too, but I appear so much that I have a not-very-nice nickname among students. I verified this was actually the case through my own investigation. 

I asked the training department to stop using me in training videos. They refused and it was said that they have the right to use the videos since there was no expectation of privacy on my part. In response, I've quit precepting until they take me out. 

This causes a reasonably big issue in the training program since I'm the only preceptor in this area and they aren't in a position to train more. This is delaying students graduation from the program and some are quite upset since they weren't scheduled to be in the city so long and have to wait longer now.

0,"AITA for making Indian cuisine for dinner? | Ok, this happened a month ago but I keep wondering if I'm in the wrong here. I'll try to keep this as succinct as possible. 

BG info: So I love Indian Cuisine even though my stomach can't handle most of the spices well the pain afterward is worth it in my book lol. I happen to grow up next to a lovely Indian family, I became best friends with their two daughters and their mom became a bit of a surrogate mother for me as my mom was a single parent that worked long hours. Takes a village right? Anyway, I spent as much time over at my friend's house as at home if not more and was even learned how to cook a few meals. One of my favorites is makhn murg or better known as butter chicken. 

So about a month ago I hosted a dinner party for my friend's group maybe (12? people) this included individuals SO's or whomever they wished to bring as a plus one. So the main dish I served was naan and butter chicken, along with a vegetarian curry dish. One of my friends we will call him Mac brought his new GF ""Ann"" along. 

At first, Ann really seemed to enjoy the dishes I provided, I mean she ate two helpings. When she was on her third helping she asked what restaurant I had ordered from as she wanted to order from them as well in the future. I told her I made it actually, that it was an authentic Indian recipe even explained where I had gotten it from. 

Ann stopped eating and (paraphrasing) basically read me the riot act for cultural appropriation. How it was inappropriate for me to serve it and bill it as authentic Indian food. I (here is where I may be the ass) was so stunned that I started laughing and said are you serious right now? Don't you think you're being just a little bit ridiculous? 

Well, Mac and Ann ended up leaving in a bit of a dramatic flourish. The evening went on and though most of my friends agreed with me Mac sent me a text later telling me how insensitive I had been and how I was in the wrong. I reiterated that I didn't feel it was appropriation but appreciation. I didn't profit off of it in any way and I feel they were massively overreacting.

He has a habit of meeting a girl (yeah, he’s 41 but dates 18 and 19 year olds) and having her over to spend the night on his weekends. I don’t know why. I point out he has 26 other days a month to “get to know them”. I think he shows off our son so they can see what a good dad he is.
He told me about the latest one, a week after he met her online. 37 (wow, the oldest by far besides me), just got fired from her job, lives at home sleeping on the couch, and has a 16 year old daughter. Literally that weekend and EVERY weekend since she’s been at his house, mostly leaving the daughter with grandma 45 minutes away. My son told me he does not like her, she sits on the couch on her phone all day, they don’t even leave the house, and he said she is using his dad because she doesn’t want to go home. My son told all of this to his dad who promised a “dudes only weekend!” Guess who he picked him up with and stayed the whole weekend?
Anyhow, my ex sees nothing wrong with going through women like toilet paper and said he would see it no differently if I did the same.

Today it was just us two at home and he was making lunch for himself. He heated up some leftover rice, added some soy sauce, and cracked a raw egg directly into the rice. I asked him what the hell he was making. He said it was TKG, a popular Japanese comfort food. 


I told him that raw eggs shouldn’t be consumed and to heat that up in the microwave until the egg is cooked. He said he wanted to try something he just learned about and that raw eggs are safe and that the warm rice will cook the eggs a little. 


I told him that raw eggs definitely aren’t safe and he could get salmonella from them and that the rice definitely wouldn’t cook the eggs enough for it to significantly reduce the chances of contracting salmonella. I also said that he could get sick from it and hospitals are already overfilled. 


He told me to stop being so annoying. He proceeded to take his first bite. I grabbed his bowl and blasted it in the microwave for 40 seconds. He told me to stop fucking with his food. I told him to trust me on this. He was pissed at me. 


He told our parents at night. After hearing both sides, they said that I should have just let him eat it because they think organic eggs in America are very safe to consume raw.

Furthermore, it's a piece of forniture I don't like so much, and really we don't have any space left.
And it's not a lifelong dream, just a itch he'd like to scratch.

Today he told me that he has gave some hint to his brother to receive it for his birthday and that we must find a way to make some space (aka: I must find the space, cause I am the one who are able to do it).

AITA for being mad that he asked for a thing we have agreed we didn't need, and he wants me to be cool with it and even find a solution?",False,False
1,"AITA for not telling my son the truth about where his father was? | When my son was six months old, his father was sent to prison for 17 years. 

I knew there would be questions as my son got older, and I was so concerned that at that young age he wouldn’t be able to understand that his father did a bad thing but that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s an all around bad guy or that my son had any reason to feel badly or afraid about what had happened. 

It’s just not possible for a young kid to fully understand what prison is or the reality of being in prison, and I didn’t want him growing up ashamed of his father, or worse, afraid for him or worried about what was happening to him, worried I’d go to prison, or anything like that. 

I decided I would tell my son his dad was working in a foreign country without internet or phone. That way he wouldn’t be falsely put through the grief of thinking his dad was dead or that he didn’t have a father at all. We could look at pictures, I could read the letters when they came, he could send letters back. 

Questions came up over the years, but I answered them. “What country?” “I don’t know. He can’t tell me because some of the work is confidential.” “Why can’t he come visit for the holidays?” “They don’t celebrate our holidays in that country so his off time never coordinates with ours.” “Why can’t we go visit him?” “It’s too far and too expensive.” 

I figured then at the end of the 17 years, when he was older and could understand prison and crime and his dad was getting out, I could tell him about his dad and what he’d done and it could be his decision whether he wanted to reach out or not because he’d be nearly 18.

Well, surprise. My son is 15, his dad was paroled early, and he showed up at our house. My son is furious. But not for the reason I expected. I knew I’d take some heat for lying to him and thought it was one of those “at first he’ll be disillusioned, but when he’s older he’ll thank me.” Situations. But he said

“You let me go all these years thinking my dad was out there choosing a job over me. You let me think he was a deadbeat and that he didn’t want me. He didn’t have a choice! He was in prison!” 

I hadn’t considered that. I took for granted that as an adult I kind of shrug off “you’ve gotta work when and where there’s work” as a sad but unfortunate reality. I never fully realized how it could sound to him, that he was a second priority. 

Was I protecting him by not telling him straight away that his father was in prison, or am I the asshole?",False,False

Not trying to be very secretive I tell my mom what happened (she was asleep when I left home) and she proceeds to scold me for spending money recklessly.

0,"AITA for not showing any kind of affection to my mom? | My mom and dad got divorced when I was like 8, my older brother and I stayed with my mom for 2 years, which were torture, she was abusive and actually sometimes got to fake her own death just so my brother and I would do what she said, until  she kicked us out to the street, we had to go to our neighbors' house to call my dad, my mom didn't even had the decency of calling him herself... Anyways... so my dad raised us from then on. My dad has been very supportive, caring and has always looked out for me and my brother, and both came up pretty nice, we're decent fellas I'd like to think.

My mom and dad are hardly ever in the same room, but my brother had his first kid 2 months ago so they've been together lately. I'm a 25 year old guy who loves to hug his dad and to be annoying to him. It may be weird for some people but I don't care, whenever we're standing talking to someone I sometimes come out of nowhere and hug him from behind and stuff like that. So, since my brother has had his first kid my mom and dad have been in the same room many times lately, and I've kept hugging my dad out of nowhere.

My mom gets pretty jealous and snaps her fingers to grab my attention and start demanding affection from me. I'm not a very affective person, I just show affection to my dad and my SO, otherwise 0 affection.

I see my mom ocasionally, once a month perhaps but I do not feel close to her, and I don't feel like showing any affection, but sometimes I feel bad for her, seeing her son hugging his dad but not wanting to hug her, but yet again, she kicked us out of the house...

1,"AITA for hiding my girlfriend's hoodie? | Me and my girlfriend have been dating for about six months, and everything has been really good except for one thing. She wears a blue men's sized hoodie everywhere and I mean everywhere family outings, date nights, walks. If it's too hot she'll tie it around her waist, but she's never without it.
For a bit of clarification we started dating in the summer time.

I've asked her about it, where she got it, stuff like that (I was afraid it was a ex's hoodie.) She's told me it's a comfort thing, and she feels secure with it on/around her.

I don't like it, it goes down to her knees and is super baggy, not in a cute way. It looks like she's wearing a potato sack. I've offered her my hoodies, offered to buy her a new hoodie, offered it have it hemmed (my sister is a seamstress) but she refuses all of it. 
It's become a regular thing we argue about, especially if we want to go somewhere nice or upscale for a date. A few days ago we got into a massive fight about it at my house.
I told her it makes her look depressed and like a shut-in, she said I didn't have any control over what she wore, etc. It escalated and eventually she stormed out, but she accidentally left the hoodie behind.

I was so tempted to cut the damn thing up right then, but decided to hide it in the back of my closet. She asked me an hour later if I'd seen it, I told her I hadn't. 

I haven't seen her the last couple of days, but we've texting back and forth. We've mostly made up from the fight and things look to be getting better. She's still looking for it, but I don't know what I should do with the hoodie. Am I the asshole?",False,False
0,"AITA for dismissing people when they ask how tall I am? | I am 6'7""-6'8"", and it occasionally gets me unwanted attention. People frequently ask how tall I am, which I am perfectly happy to answer in normal conversation. It usually leads to sports talk, which I am more than comfortable in because I played sports and follow quite a few pretty closely. However, I feel that sometimes my privacy/personal space gets invaded with people asking me, and I will dismiss the question. This includes people interrupting phone calls, tapping me on the shoulder when I have headphones on, walking down the street having conversations with other people, but also times where I'm simply existing and can see them staring at me while they think about asking. Usually these people have the same follow-up questions: Basketball? Parent Height? Sibling Height? My sister's roommate's whatever is 6'2"".

&#x200B;

I completely understand the curiosity, I do. When I see a person my height, I wonder the exact same thing. Did he/she play a sport? At what level? How good would they be at my sport? So that part isn't lost on me. I choose not ask any questions not because I think it would be an asshole move (I really don't know, that's why I'm making this post) but because I know they get asked all the time, more than most people would guess. And besides, if we're at the same event, someone is probably going to introduce us to each other as the tall people anyways. 

&#x200B;

So, when I get the question while I feel like I'm doing something that didn't need to be interrupted, I will frequently not answer and continue to walk/speak to whomever I was speaking with. It gets dicey with the headphones because it's a little more pointed to just put them back in, I usually just suck it up and answer those. AITA for dismissing these people?",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting my fiancée to invite her stepdaughter to our wedding? | My fiancée and I have been dating 3 years, engaged for 4 months. Although she is not yet 30, she is already a widow. Her first husband died 5 years ago in a freak skiing accident soon after their marriage. He also fathered a child when he was just 17. Now, the girl is 15 and living with her mother.

My fiancée still keeps in touch with the girl (technically her stepdaughter) even though they live in different countries. She sends her presents at Christmas and on her birthday. They even write letters to each other and meetup once in a while.

I think its nice how my fiancee still tries to keep in contact with her stepdaughter, but now she wants to invite her and her mother to our wedding. I do not see the merit in this. Although our wedding will be quite large (500+ people), I find it odd that she would invite her stepdaughter who she doesn’t have any familial relation to. Her stepdaughter is also the spitting image of my fiancée’s first husband, and I would not like to be walking down the aisle and catching a glimpse of this reminder of her first marriage.

0,"AITA for not answering a friend's question about a series rightfully in an attempt to not give away any spoiler. | So a friend of mine asked if I could search something on Google for her about something that happened in a series she was watching. She didn't want to do it herself because she was afraid that she might read something about the plot which she didn't want to know and she knew that I was not going to watch the series and I could get spoilered.

""Hey could you look up something for me about ""series title""?  
I don't want to read any spoiler.""

She wanted to know if a character is **dead** at a point in the series which she has already seen.  
I fought it was kind of a weird question but I looked at the Wikipedia page of the Series and of this specific character anyway and found out that later in the series it is going to be revealed that the character wasn't actually dead and what my friends has seen is supposed to be a fake death.

At this point I wasn't sure what to do as she wrote that she didn't want to know any spoilers.  
I told her that the character was truly dead, as I wanted to go the safe route and didn't want to give away any plot twist later in the series.

She accepted it and about 30min later she calls me a ""dumb liar"" after searching online for herself as she wanted to know if the character was **truly dead** or not. She wanted to know the twist.

In my opinion ""Tell me something about the series."" and ""Please do not give away spoilers"" are polar opposites of each other and basically left me in a lose-lose-situation.  
For her it was a simple yes/no question if the character is dead. I'd say that it depends who you ask. Someone who has seen the whole series, I would of course tell that the character is NOT dead but I would say YES if that someone hasn't seen the twist yet.",False,False
0,"AITA for being mad my coworker went to HR on my behalf? | 
I'm a woman in an office that's mostly men, and me and the other women have a lunch out once every few weeks. It's generally good, we help each other out with stuff, hang out and shoot the shit, etc.

One of the women, Julia, has a kind of abrasive personality, kind of judgemental and very quick to focus on bad things rather than good. But I haven't said anything about it so far because I think she's well meaning. 

Anyway, at this lunch, my coworker Megan and I who get along really well were kind of venting about a guy who we work with, who interrupts us a lot, talks over us and shit like that, doesn't really pick up on social cues... 

I'm not too bothered by him, he is like that to everyone and it isn't like he's being disrespectful to us because we're women, he's just kind of socially oblivious towards everyone. But I was frustrated enough about him talking over parts of my presentation that morning that I was venting a little.

It totally wasn't the best choice to vent in front of more people... I'll be the first to admit that. 

Julia started saying stuff about how that isn't right and how I ought to go to HR. I said I didn't think it had come to that at all, so I'd deal with this in person. 

Anyway, a few days later, Julia came to my desk and told me she'd arranged a meeting with HR, and to come with her now. 

I was baffled and went ""Why?"" And she said that she was doing this because of what Megan and I said at lunch about him speaking over us. 

I said ""It wasn't your place to say."" And didn't get up. 

She said to come to the meeting she'd arranged and I said no, I was busy, I didn't have time to do this. I had actual work to be doing. I told her to tell anyone who might be expecting me that she was mistaken and I had no complaints and nothing to report.

She left and seemed frustrated, and so was I. I've dealt with HR before (at a previous company, about much much more serious stuff) and I just didn't think this was something I wanted to take to HR. 

And even if it had been something worth reporting, I'd want the power to do it on my terms, when I was ready, and after I'd prepared with solid evidence, because I know HR departments won't do shit unless you make them think the company could be in legal trouble.

So later that day, I got a meeting request from HR and I figured I knew why. The HR guy told me someone had reported that I felt my coworker talks over women too much. I said that the person who made the report must have misunderstood something, or taken something out of context, because that is not something I have said. And that was that.

I feel honestly pretty mad at Julia but I bit my tongue and went home.

I can't remember if anyone else found any, but at any rate, everyone agreed on one of the ones I had found and we reserved it and paid for it. 

Now, just over a week out, one of the couples mentioned that they were planning to bring their dog. 

I responded that unfortunately, the property doesn't allow pets. It's not even that you could pay a fee or an extra deposit - pets just aren't allowed.

They said they don't know what they're going to do because they don't have anyone to leave the dog with, and there's so little time to make arrangements at this point. They seem annoyed and I'm afraid they're going to cancel, or sneak the dog there anyway, or I don't know what.

I responded that I hadn't known I needed to include ""allows pets"" in my search criteria (it never occurred to me, and they didn't say anything about it) and that I was sorry there was a miscommunication.

It’s not a huge park, just a little local job with a play structure and a couple swings directly adjacent. 

I get there and see a kid having a full blown meltdown about not being able to go into the park and the mother was telling her “I know I promised but we can’t go today” and I couldn’t help but overhear it, but it was none of my business, so I kept on. 

But the mother stopped me and whispered “There’s a homeless guy living in the play structure, you don’t want your kids in there.”

I wasn’t really sure what she meant but knew how amped my kids had been for the park so decided I had to see for myself. 

Sure enough there was a guy sleeping under the covered portion of the play structure. I thought about it for a second and this park was put here for kids to play in. We have other municipal structures in place for homeless people. 

So I went over and called to him and said it was morning, the park was now in use, so he needed to continue on. 

He ignored me and went back to sleep. I told him if he didn’t leave the playground I’d have to call someone. He muttered something to the effect of “go away.”

I called the police’s non emergency number and explained the situation. They sent a cop over who talked to him and assessed his state of mind and determined he was fine and offered him some resources and a ride. 

The guy refused to leave. The cop told him he’d have to leave. He got into it with the cop. The cop told him leave now or be arrested now. The guy eventually left.

I thought some people were being snakey, and I was having a big problem with alcohol and drugs. Its a miracle I graduated. 

But I ended my 3rd year with a breakdown. I get a bit ''cinematic'' about things, and I guess I said to myself I needed to leave that place and never return.

I have to skip my best friend’s 30th birthday dinner for that so now she’s angry at me.

A few months back my best friend asked over group chat if I and our other friends have anything scheduled on the weekend of her birthday because she wants to have a dinner party. Everyone said they’re free so far, but other details were never finalized and she never said anything else about it after that so I didn’t think much of it.

Girlfriend asked me last week if I wanted to go as her plus one to her friend’s wedding and I said yes. The next day my best friend messaged me reminding me of her birthday dinner this weekend. I said I didn’t know she was going through with the dinner and I already said yes to going with girlfriend to her friend’s wedding, so I can’t go to best friend’s dinner. 

Best friend said she never said it was postponed so why did I assume that she wasn’t going through with it. She said it’s hard to coordinate everyone’s schedule and everyone else is free this weekend so she hoped I would go. I said I’m sorry I assumed wrong but again I already said yes to girlfriend.

Best friend said she gets it and to have fun at the wedding. I said thanks and promised to make it up to her and our other friends. But later that night she messaged me and said she’s been thinking about it the whole night and she tried to understand but she can’t get over the fact that I chose a girl I’ve been dating for a month over people I’ve been friends with for years. 

I told her I’m not choosing girlfriend over them, it’s just that girlfriend invited me to a finalized event first. Best friend said the wedding is full of people who don’t know me and won’t care if I’m there or not, while it is her birthday and the dinner is with people who’ve been friends with me for 10 years and will miss something if I’m not there. She said she’s always been there for me and the one time she asks me to be there for her I put a person I barely knew first and she doesn’t know if she can get past that. 

I tried calling and messaging her but she blocked me. We used to talk every day but she hasn’t said a word to me in three days. Our other friends don’t seem to know what’s going on and will go to her dinner as far as I can tell from our group chat. 

She’s my best friend and I don’t want her to be hurt but on the other hand I feel like she's overreacting. She knows my girlfriend is very important to me too, and even though we’ve known each other for just two months, I have very strong feelings for her and can see a future with her.

I was gone for about 1 minute. When I came back, an old man of about 70 was standing there. The meat man finally finished the customer he had originally been serving and then he looked at me and asked how he could help

The old man yelled and said I was here first. He just got here. The meat man tried to explain that I had just stepped away but the man wasn’t having it. The man began yelling at me for being a line cutter etc. I just decided I didn’t want a confrontation and I ignored him and started ordering my meat. The man got in my face but I only see him in my peripheral vision, I am still not looking. Finally I had enough and I stepped directly in front of him and kind of bumped him back so he wouldn’t bother the meat man.

0,"AITA for not lending my sister my expensive bag? | This happened a few yrs ago but i just remembered it so anws i got an internship at a law firm even though i was fairly young( itwas part of a school attachment programme). Anyways I wanted to make a good impression so i asked my sister if i could borrow a nice bag from her to bring to work, it wasn’t anything expensive, definitely around $20, but she refused to lend it to me. I was a bit stressed because I didn’t have any nice bags to carry and neither did I have the money to buy one for myself so I told my mom and she bought me a rather nice expensive bag (around $200) since she was proud of me for getting this internship and also she knew that this was something i could use for many future occasions as well. I was very happy and grateful of course but fast forward a few months later my sister wants to borrow my bag, now normally i would be okay with her borrowing something from me however this bag was rather expensive and I only used it for special occasions and besides a few months ago she wouldn’t even lend me her bag to use for a few days, so i refused to lend her the bag. My dad called me out on it and said i was just being selfish and still took her side even after i explained why i did not want to lend her the bag.

0,"AITA? I'd rather skip my sister's wedding than leave the kids with their paternal grandparents. | I'm 29f. When I was 22 I got pregnant and the father and I had a shotgun wedding. When we got married he already had a son. A year ago we divorced and due to the reasoning for the divorce I retained full custody of both kids (12m and 6f).

My (half) sister (28f) told me last night that her wedding, which is in about 6 weeks, is restricted to ages 10 and up.

Due to personal reasons (theirs) neither of my kids do well with people they don't know, and take a while to warm up to strangers. Due to laws in our country, my son cannot watch his sister alone, and I don't want to put that on him, but if I did leave them alone and something happened I would stand to lose custody of both of them. There's only a few adults they are comfortable with: my mother, me, my sister, their therapist, and that's about it. So babysitter is out, kids staying home is out, and mum will be out of town at the time so mum watching them is not an option. I explained this to my sister, and she said that they have their paternal grandparents.

I am in contact with their paternal grandparents, who aren't far away, and they have seen them a couple of times since the divorce, but I'm uncomfortable with them seeing the kids because the only time they've been alone with the kids since the divorce my daughter came home accusing me of ""keeping daddy away"". My son told me that their grandparents had been talking like that since I dropped them off.

My sister, who is fully aware of this, says that it would be better if I just left my daughter with the grandparents for the few hours of ceremony and reception, and I could stop by the grandparents' house while people were taking photos, leave early, or skip reception entirely, but I am really uncomfortable with them spending any length of time with her due to the last time they watched her. My sister insisted it wasn't a big deal, it's only a few hours and what could they possibly do in that time, and begged me to come to her wedding, as this will be a once in a lifetime event for her and she wanted me there. I said I'd see what I could do but couldn't promise anything.

She then sent a very emotional message saying she's been there for me for years and she wants me there when she gets married, and that she's sorry about the kids rule but she won't change it just for me because it'll open her wedding day up to ""well she brought her 6 year old, why wasn't my 8 year old allowed?"", and she's especially hurt because my kids do have grandparents in the area who would be willing to watch them but I'm choosing not to ask them.

1,"AITA for ditching my friends for being losers? | So I'll straight up admit it: in the context of high schoo, I could be considered a huge, huge loser. I'm 15 and I've never been to a party, never kissed a girl, don't play any sports, and my face looks like the aftermath of a war due to acne. 

So my entire 'friend group' are losers as well. I never really liked them to begin with, but just hang out with them because they're the only people that accept me. But honestly, I hate everything about them. They sit around all day playing video games like lazy asses. They don't make any effort to improve themselves. They think they're edgy by hating on popular kids as dumb. They're basically okay with the fact they're losers. 

I'm not. I want to improve my life, want to be popular, want to have friends I don't hate, and I want girls to actually like me. So I drew out an entire plan. Step 1 is to ditch all these 'friends' that are dragging me down. They hurt me in multiple ways: socially, associating with them hurts my reputation, and hanging out with them hurts me instead of helps me, because they never do anything productive or useful. So I ditched them and started doing a lot if self-improvement: getting rid of my acne, working out, learning how to dress, and 0racticing social skills. My goal is to be more popular by the time sophomore year rolls around. And so far, it's been great. I look so much better, and people say I'm unrecognizable. The progress is exhilarating.

But today, I randomly ran into one of my ex-friends, Ryan. He immediately was pissed off I ditched them/wouldn't hang out with them anymore. He then called me out for being a 'poser' and trying to act popular. I explained that's exactly the reason I don't want to hang out with them anymore.

1,"AITA For Kissing My Gay Friend, To Let Me Borrow Some Books | Me (17/m)

Friend (17/m)

We have been friends for almost two years and are extremely close. He's gay and doesn't really hide it, but he's also not ""open"" about it either. He knows that I know he's gay and it's not really something we ever talked about before, but it's comforting that we can be honest with each other without bringing it up. But I'm pretty sure he likes me romantically. I like him but not in that way.

A few weeks ago I found out that he had an entire book collection that I've been looking for online for years. They're really old and hard to find so I couldn't believe that he had them. I asked him if I could borrow the books to read them but he declined, saying they're expensive(They are, like $200 a piece). I even offered to ""rent"" them for a bit by giving him some money, telling him I'd pay him back but he still refused.

Cut to some days later, and I came up with an idea to get the books. Since I knew he liked me I figured I could use that to my advantage and told him that I liked him (I don't). The plan worked and after one thing led to another, we kissed. I told him that since I kissed him, I should get something in return, and he let me borrow the books.

After the kiss I went home and we didn't talk about it for the rest of the weekend. Over the next week at school, he started making weird advances towards me, as if he thinks we're in a relationship, and seems to want to hang out with me more often. I keep telling him I'd rather not hang out since I'm busy reading the books he lent me. After a while I stopped returning his texts since I really am busy, and I don't have the heart to tell him to stop texting me so much.

 I don't know if that was the wrong move because lately he stopped talking to me altogether, even when I try texting him. Eventually I found out that my (f) found out about the kiss (probably through him since I don't know how else she would know) and she says it was a shit thing to do. Especially since I had no intention of reciprocating his feelings. I find that ridiculous since it was just a kiss.",False,False

We used to be incredibly close until her divorce from the kids father. She became the kind of friend that only contacts you when she has drama or needs a favor. About two years ago she asked me to babysit overnight and be paid . Her daughter has been kicked out of numerous dAycares for biting, kicking etc. her son is an angel.

I come from a family of nine nieces and nephews. One has special needs so I thought I could handle anything. The little girl kicked her brother, spit, refused to put pajamas on. The little boy was an angel and cooperative for dinner, playing, bed time. I told the older one it was time to go to bed and she went wild like a banshee. She would climb on the kitchen table. I would lift her off the table and bring her back to bed. Several times. She would hide under the table. I put her back in bed several times, for her to get out. I called her mother at work and she told her child to listen. Nothing helped. The final straw was the kid picking up a piece of wood and trying to hit me with it. I told her to knock it off and she was to stay in bed. I sat outside the door while this kid screamed bloody murder in her bed sobbing like I was abusing her.

0,"AITA for refusing an additional guest at our wedding | Thanks for watching this post. First time writing here and non-native English speaker. 

I am getting married very soon. As you can imagine, this takes a lot of preparation. I'm talking here about the civil wedding, which will be very intimate and consequently restricted to our very close family: parents, siblings and, in my case, godparents and their children. The wedding will happen in another country, so this takes a lot of preparation as it is in another culture. 

When I made the invitations, I've been clear: I invited my parents (2 p.) and my godparents' family (4 p.). I've been very flexible, I told everyone that they could join us anytime they like (i.e., arrive in the country when they wish because I understand it's complicated when you have 4 different jobs etc) as long as they'll be present for the ceremony. Moreover, because the destination is far, my in-laws kindly proposed to offer the accommodation to all of them. The wedding is now in one month and I just received a message from my godmother saying that they have booked the flights, and they will be 5 because the gf of my cousin is joining. That's where I am really feeling uncomfortable:

I receive this as a 'fait accompli' (done deal) without any prior consultation, without even asking me if that's ok to have an additional person (that I've never met). I've always been clear about the number of people invited. I just can't stand to receive this kind of 'news' via a late evening text message. It's not that I'm against that additional person. It's just the way that I'm put in front of this, as if I had nothing to say. And we're not talking about the 'party' wedding, but something very special that is meant to be in strict intimacy. Moreover, I know that they have their tickets since 1 month, and I was waiting for their news to plan the trip etc. So they literally waited 1 month to announce it, now that the date is getting closer. I just don't understand this kind of behavior. It costs nothing to make a quick phone call before booking anything, and to ask if it's possible, etc. In sum, they just invited someone at my wedding, someone that wasn't ever planned and that I don't even know.

This morning, I sent a polite message saying: 'I'm confused by your news, I've always been clear about the number of guests and why I picked these specific guests (i.e. you) for our wedding. Why haven't you called me and asked me before booking anything? I'm put in front of a done deal, and I have to oppose myself to it, as it goes against the very idea of what we've been planning for months. The solution to this situation, I am afraid, does not lie within my hands. If X is feeling uncomfortable about this, I could understand, but with respect to my in-laws, I just cannot accept this compromise.' 

So: Am I the asshole? More precisely: Am I the asshole for refusing this, for writing to them clearly that it will not be possible and that they should have contacted me before doing anything?

0,"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to use my food to feed her friends? | A few days ago, my girlfriend hosted a brunch day for her and her friends at our house. My girlfriend bought some food and wine so they could make a whole event out of it. 

I don't have a lot of spare money and so what I spend on food is usually all I have. Usually  what I buy, I have to make last until the next payday. Each meal is calculated and planned for my work lunches. 

After work I was at the gym and I receive a text from my girlfriend asking if she could cook some of my chicken breasts that I set aside for my lunches because her friends were hungry and specifically wanted the chicken. I replied with, ""I'd prefer if you didn't. Can you use the pork instead?"" She didn't like this response and proceeded to say ""No its fine, I told them you said no...thanks."" Knowing my girlfriend and how she can be sometimes, I tried to call her and work through the issue. She was still mad and I was at the gym so I gave up. She kept calling me back and I did eventually realize that I had some extra chicken (a decent amount) in the freezer which I told her I forgot about and I would be more than happy to let her use it. This particular chicken was what she had wanted to use in the first place but I confused it with the chicken I set out for my lunches. 

This still didn't make her happy and by the time I got home, our other roommate defrosted some of her own chicken so my girlfriend could use it. My girlfriends argument was that I should have not said no to begin with and should have just let her take it; she stated she would have given me money to buy more or gone out and bought more herself. This last statement was hard to believe as the next two proceeding days she works nights and wouldn't have time. She stated that if my friends came over she would give them whatever they wanted and tried to be a good host and person. 

Regardless I didn't feel as if I acted out of line asking if she could use the pork instead and once I realized my mistake I thought I corrected myself and gave her what she wanted. It all culminated with her saying I am inconsiderate, mean, and so forth.

For example, his HS graduation was a bigger deal with lots of people attending, mine was just a quiet dinner. That was just one thing among many others.

I know it's a bit petty, but I think I do hold some resentment. So Steve graduated from college years ago and it was a big deal since he was the first person to graduate in our family.  I am in college right now and have to take an extra year due to some other issues I am having and I've been frustrated about it.

So my brother has a 3 year old son, and was throwing a big birthday party for him. Throughout the party I was ridiculed, for example, in a conversation with my uncle and aunt, my aunt said about me ""well at least if this one doesn't graduate college, we'll still have Steve to celebrate about."" 

Steve also made a few digs at me, saying in a supposed joking manner ""once you drop out, I'll get you a job to shine my shoes every morning"" and people around me laughed, including my parents. I was ticked me off because I hate being reminded of my failures.

In addition, when there were a few guests that arrived, they ignored me straight up completely and went to Steve even if I was standing right there.

I got so fed up that I walked over to the birthday cake that was sitting on the table in the back and when no one was looking, I punched my fist through the middle of it, then I went back and joined the party.

It turned out to be a mistake since someone did see me and informed my parents. My parents called me outside and scolded me and told me I was being selfish, I told them I was tired of being mocked and how they were also just as bad for not doing anything about it.

I was told to go apologize to Steve and try to make it up to him, and when we went back inside he ran over to me and asked ""what is your fucking problem?""

I told him that I hate being made fun of, but Steve did not express remorse and instead told me to go apologize to his son for ruining the cake, I told him ""you apologize first you fucking dickhead."" His son was only 3 years old, so I figured he wouldn't even remember what happened, and I was mad that Steve refused to acknowledge his bullying.

Together we hitchhiked across Chile and Argentina when i was 18. We went to wild parties near home too. I had the courage to ask out my girlfriend (now engaged) because he pretty much forced me to start talking to a rally hot girl that walked across us in the bar. If you guys ever played the Uncharted game series, my uncle is basically Sully. He looks similar and his voice is similar  and his personality is too. My uncle was one of the greatest people I've ever met. I have so many good memories with him. He even joked about how his funeral should be a party and that we all should get completely wasted. He believed funerals shouldn't be so sad and gloomy, celebrate the life the dead lived not grieve over them being gone, be glad they existed. He even jokingly said that if he were to die soon (obviously he was hoping to live longer than this) he said he'd want me to propose to my gf during his funeral. I started dating her because of him and i should take it to the next step in honor with him. I honestly thought this was a fucking hilarious idea but also a way of commerotaing him so i told him i'd do it if he were to die before we were married. Unfortunately he died a month ago from a stroke that was completely unexpected and i was devastated. I tried to get my family to throw a party in his honor as he requested but nobody wanted to do it no matter how much i tried so i decided to propose to my girlfriend during his funeral. My girlfriend knew my uncle for 5 years and saw him as a father figure as well ( she didn't have one and we both started dating when we were 16) and although she didn't have prior knowledge of my proposal, she wasn't shocked by it and thought it was cute.

SO the day of the funeral comes and we all speak kind words about him. They save me to make the last speech and i go on for probably 20 minutes about how much he meant to me. At the end i said, ""in honor of my uncle, I'm proposing to my girlfriend, I had the courage to ask her out because of him and now I'm proposing to her in his honor as he requested."" My girlfriend accepted my proposal and i gave her the ring my uncle gave to my aunt (she died previously). Most of the guests were like wtf are you doing and were pretty pissed off.

1,"Aita for telling a co'worker' that no her marrying a sugar daddy is not the same as charitable giving | I work at an animal shelter, full time actual employee.  We also have full and part time volunteer positions too.

One of the volunteers is one of those people who never worked a real day in their life but still says/lies about how her family has to work like the rest of us. She's been a full time volunteer for about 2 and a half years, she's 24 and when she was 22 she married some then 28 year old tech bro that hit it big at a local software company since he had his masters degree at age 20 like she reminds everyone whenever they ask about him... and also how he works suuuper hard to support her so she can 'follow her dream of being a full time animal shelter volunteer'. 


Unlike most volunteers here, full or part time, she never donates money to the shelter. Instead when she's asked she's all well my husband works full time to support me so I can volunteer here, and how she'd feel weird asking for more from him so she considers his working so she can have an easy life and not work to be his charity contribution for here.


I got sick of hearing her say that each time someone asked so yesterday I snapped and told her to drop the act and just admit she's a cheapskate instead of trying to act selfless and like it would be such a huge sacrifice to help the shelter out monetarily since most everyone else already does.

1,"AITA for selling my underwear? | I am currently attending graduate school in one of the most expensive cities in the US. I am in a situation where I make very little money and work pretty insane hours (usually 60 a week). Right now I am in a very small studio apartment living paycheck to paycheck, and eating one meal a day. I got tired of it. 

I have tried to convince my boyfriend of two years, that we should move in together. I live in a studio and he lives with two roommates. We could comfortably afford a one bedroom in an OK neighborhood in our city. 

He, however, lives in a very nice, very expensive neighborhood. He got a very good deal on his apartment and he doesn’t want to move

I started selling my underwear in January, and I’ve made a little bit more than $150 a week. I work out in the undies and take a Polaroid in them that doesn’t include my face. I get between 25 and 45 dollars a pair. It has significantly improved my quality of life. 

To make a long story short, my boyfriend came over, saw some of the Polaroids I took, and freaked out. He thinks what I’m doing is cheating. He’s upset and threatening to end our relationship over it. I don’t even know who is buying the underwear so how is it cheating? If he would get an apartment with me, I wouldn’t have to do this. I told him that I would be continuing to sell underwear so long as he refused to live with me.

She should have discussed this with me while it was happening, step by step, so I could have told her to go to the doctor to keep our son safe. His medical safety and prevention related to it should be my business. I told her I'd take her to court unless she let my mother drop in and check on my son at least once a week until I can trust her again.

1,"WIBTA if I have my 12 year old cat put down for repeatedly pissing on my bed? | My cat started pissing on my bed in January. I have had her since she was a kitten and she’s never done anything like this before. I have 2 dogs and the cat; they all get along fine. 

I took her to the vet: clean bill of health. I thought maybe she was mad about me moving her food, so I moved it elsewhere. I bought a new litter box so she would have two. I sprayed everything with feliway. I kept my bedroom door closed so she couldn’t get in. She started pissing on the bath mats and the rugs in the hallway and any towels on the floor in the laundry room. I tried new litter. I tried the old litter again. She pissed on my bed three times in late Jan / early Feb but then I got super vigilant about her being in my room at all. Over the last month I’ve been relaxing a little, I thought we were through it. She was still peeing on the towels on the floor (we live in Oregon, it rains a lot, I toss them on the floor in an effort to minimize the dogs’ muddy paw prints) but I was just like, well, this sucks, but I can wash them.

Yesterday she did it again and I think I’ve had it. I don’t like her anymore. I don’t have the money to replace my mattress and down duvet but if this keeps up I will have to. I would try to rehome her if possible but let’s be real: she is an overweight elderly cat and I live in a rural area where there are tons of extra cats. I don’t want to drop her at the shelter just so she can be miserable and terrified for a little while before she dies. 

I never thought I was the kind of person who would do something like this but I’m miserable. I have a hypersensitive sense of smell and the house is starting to smell like cat pee. Even my dishtowels smell like cat pee when they get wet now, probably from being washed with pee towels. I hate this. I don’t want to have to be hyper vigilant forever about my bedroom forever. I like keeping doors open for airflow. I keep thinking that my parents in the 70s would have just done it by now but I feel so guilty and evil.",False,False
1,"AITA for leaving the room while my wife was giving birth? | Just to be clear this happened a few years ago, and me and my wife are now parents to a beautiful, healthy girl. This particular incident got brought up because we went to family therapy - not because we're having problems or arguing or anything but because we want to take our marriage to the next level.

I don't quite have an aversion or a phobia of blood but when I see traumatic and/or gruesome things happen then I tend to get really nauseous and/or pass out. A tame example that might seem silly is that when we were watching Endgame last year I momentarily fainted when >!Thor beheaded Thanos!<. I say momentarily because it only lasted for a couple seconds and then I was awake.Another time I was watching a basketball game and somebody broke their leg to a point where the tibia was sticking out of the skin and I threw up my entire life savings. As far as I know (and my GP agrees with me) this is not indicative of any bigger health problems and its not worth taking medication for, since it happens so infrequently.

I was afraid of this happening when my wife was due to give birth and she told me that I should just suck it up - truth be told I wasn't very thrilled with hearing that because I felt like she was dismissing my legitimate concerns and making me out to be a sissy. But eventually I decided that I would try not to worry about what could happen and that I'd cross that bridge if (when) we got there. 

Narrator: It did happen.

I won't get into the gruesome details but I ended up puking, thankfully the nurses had the presence of mind to have buckets just for this purpose but I still got some on my clothes. True to form, I did momentarily faint again and came to slumped over in a chair in the corner of the room surrounded by concerned nurses. At this point I was taking a lot of attention from my wife and I was pretty sure that if I stayed in the room it'd happen again. Thus I made the decision that I had to leave and get myself cleaned up. I did ask her if it was okay with her before I left but as you guys might imagine she wasn't really lucid, all she did was nod her head but she didn't really respond. I felt awful but I felt like it was for the best, and I had a change of clothes and I brought garbage bags so I threw my clothes in the bag and got changed then waited outside the room until it was done.

Basically she feels like I abandoned her when she really needed me to support her, and she does not understand why I couldn't have just....took it.Even though there's literally nothing I can do about my condition. I was moreso afraid of something going wrong with her and the doctors having to split their attention between us, and that was the reason why I left.

1,"AITA for delivering flowers to a girl's house without her knowing? | So, I've recently moved back to my hometown after dropping out of college. I was pretty embarrassed so I didn't really tell anybody that I was moving back (it has been about a month now.) 

So anyway, there are definitely a few people that I've been meaning to hang out with, but haven't been able to work up the courage in fear of being perceived as a loser/failure etc. There's this one girl I know mostly from the internet really but we went to high school together and I've talked to her at the local bars around here for example. We were never really that close just DM'd a few times. I knew she still lived around our hometown (and she is single) so I wanted to surprise her in a funny way letting her know that I was back and maybe we can hangout or whatever. This is where I may have crossed the line?

Her dad was the coach of the boys' lacrosse team when I was in high school so I was honestly probably closer to him than her, but regardless I was able to find their address from searching his name online. On Valentine's Day I went over to the house intending on just handing it directly to her but no one was home. I was already freaked out and anxious from the whole thing and I kept second guessing myself but I didn't want to give up. I also didn't want to leave the stuff in the rain so I tried the doors/windows just to leave it in a dry spot. The window was open so I just placed it down inside on top of an end table. I bought the most traditional fucking gift I possibly could have so I don't know how it could be perceived differently, I just got flowers and a small box of chocolates, and a small card that was supposed to be ironically funny (it was just like a get well soon card) that I wrote ""I'm Back!"" on the inside. I was planning on messaging her saying it was me at like 6, figured she would be back from work by then. 

Fast forward a little bit that day, watching her instagram story she was NOT amused and definitely a little freaked out from what I could tell. I honestly just thought it would be funny but now I am afraid to tell her it was me, does that make me an asshole? I just want this whole thing to disappear.",False,False
0,"AITA for not letting my SOs ex over? | This is my first post here, and I'm on mobile so sorry if the format is weird...

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year, and have known each other and been close friends for nearly a decade. Until recently, he was very close to his ex who he had known for 2 years and dated for 3 months.

Shes a very socially awkward person. Her parents homeschooled her, and as a result, she's had very little interaction with people her own age. She has problems with her parents because of this. Her mother is super controlling, and her father doesn't really help because theres not much he can do. So she would use the house I share with my boyfriend and his brother as an escape. 

She was always a nice girl, and though I was uncomfortable having my boyfriend's ex around so much, we let her over to our home fairly often  
A few weeks ago, she accused him of violating her, which she admitted later was just a way to make him pay attention to her, as she felt that he has been ignoring her (those are her words, not mine). 

I, being protective of my boyfriend, and his family and as a result I put my foot down and said she wasn't allowed back at the house, and my boyfriend had to cut her off. I didn't say his brother couldn't speak to her, because I did still feel bad because she didn't have many friends a part from us. 

Now, she's asking to come over and hang out with us again as if nothing has happened. My boyfriend and his brother are kind people, and are willing to forgive her, but I don't know if I'm comfortable putting my family in a situation with her that could potentially blow up again. They both think I'm being too hard on her, because she doesn't understand social norms, but, I don't think you have to be too social to understand it's not okay to make false allegations like she did.

1,"AITA for not wanting my step daughters to see their biological mom? | I'm 27 and in late 2017 I got married to a man two years older than me. He has two daughters who are now 8 and 6. Once I married their dad, they started calling me mommy, and I've been one to them ever since.

As for their biological mother, she left them with their dad, when the oldest was 5 and and the youngest 3. The younger doesn't remember her and assumes I birthed her, but the oldest does, and obviously has mommy issues over it. I've always assured her that I am her true mother and that I won't leave her.

As you can guess, I'm not too fond of their biological mother, and neither is my husband. She lives all the way across the country, and called me last July out of the blue to ""thank"" me for doing the job she never ""could"". She asked to speak to her daughters and I said no.

We've been talking more cordially since then, and last week she spoke to both of her daughters. They were confused but somewhat grasped what was going on. She promised to call them the next day, and she never did, which pissed me off.

Ever since then I've been ignoring her calls but finally answered today. She announced that she is coming to our state next week for some friends wedding, and is in interested seeing ""her"" daughters.

I barely feel comfortable with her speaking to them on the phone, let alone letting her spend time with them. So I said no.

So their biological mom called my husband and complained about how bitchy I've been to her, and to my absolute shock, my husband sided with her and said I've been unnecessarily rude to her. He also said that he is allowing our daughters to see and get to know her, especially because the older one hasn't seen her in so long. His entire family agreed with him and ganged up on me, calling me uptight and all else.

I haven't talked to my husband ever since then but I've been doing the same routine with my daughters. But I don't know how to explain any of this to them or how angry it makes me.

0,"AITA for not caring for my mom? | I don't know how any of this stuff works but I'm just going to leave this here as I've been thinking about this for so long. 

For context: My mom's married to my dad until now. Mom's been working overseas since I was 2 years old. My dad's been working overseas since I was 7. They had my brother around that time too. They work in different countries from each other. I'm a few years away from college. I'm living with my grandma (mother's side).

&#x200B;

Since my mom has been gone for so long, I don't really feel anything with her. Yes she comes back home every 2-4 years, but during those times she comes back home, I don't feel as comfortable with her compared to my dad. 

My mom also has a not-pleasant personality. Sure she's friendly, but whenever I tell her about my school achievements, (e.g. When I won first runner up in a school contest) all she says is: ""Why didn't you get the first place?"". I also discovered, when my dad showed me their text conversation, that she always talks shit about me.

Fast forward 2015, mom cheats on dad with a guy she met in the place where she's currently working. We just knew about it when she gave birth to their illegitimate child. My relatives were the first ones to know about it as my mother finally told them. They didn't want to tell me because they thought I was going to be mad about it. Jokes on them, 1st, my cousin told me secretly & 2nd, when I was on a call with my mom, I heard a baby crying. I asked her who was it and she just hung up on me.Basically, my reaction to my cousin first telling me and my relatives telling me about my half sister is this: okay. They thought that I was just reeling back my anger when in actuality, I just. Didn't care. When I received that news, it felt like they were just telling me gossip about the neighbor. Cute story, but I don't really care.

2017, my mom went home in our country: this time with her new man and my half-sister! She even let the guy meet grandma. There was this whole drama about it but that's not the point. The guy hated my little brother and didn't let him near with my half sister. I hated that guy.

2019, my mom had another child with the guy. Honestly I was expecting it. The only thing that made me mad was the fact that she and my dad are still married and she just... doesn't care.  The only thing my dad did was care for her and now, this.

Anyways, in the past few months, she's been struggling in where she's working. She has a toddler and a baby with her that she needs to take care of, her 'boyfriend' is not really helping with the children, they always argue, she has 2 jobs that barely covers the bills, and she hasn't had a proper meal for long. When I heard about it, the only thing I thought of is: Karma. My grandma really wants to help her and I am -this- close to telling her: please don't.

Am I the asshole for not caring for her even though she's the one that birthed me?

1,"AITA for ghosting a girl | Throwaway just in case as I know she's on Reddit.

We met through Tinder 1 year ago and everything was going swimmingly for the first the first 6 months and we talked on a daily basis for hours at a time.

One afternoon we somehow got to the topic of my previous marriage and how we used to keep a wish list and when a birthday/Christmas would come up we'd just buy each other what was on the wish list..
It was coming up to Christmas at this point and I joked that she'll (my tinder date) will want me to buy her a new car. 
But I did offer should she need anything over the Christmas period especially for her younger 6 year old daughter who was incredibly sweet.

A week later I get an email from her with an actual wish list with $300 worth of gift cards, perfume and other things. I was shocked.

She didn't bring it up but things subsequently started to get awkward between us and I was quite annoyed she'd do that.
I stopped seeing her as often and about 2 months later we just stopped talking as much.

Fast forward another two months and we'd been talking on and off but not regularly - she would say things like ""how she missed the way we used to talk"".

Eventually I kinda just gave up and I deleted her from most of my social media.
I didn't say anything to her as we weren't really talking much anymore

Quite honestly I didn't think it would've worked out 
A few days after I get a few angry messages from her of how ""we could've been friends""

1,"AITA for eating a Cadbury creme egg? | This happened years ago, but I need a distraction, so I'm posting it.

One year in college, Easter and spring break didn't line up and I was on campus for the holiday. On Easter Saturday (the day before Easter), my friend and I realized that it was almost Easter and neither of us had eaten a Cadbury creme egg yet. This was in the US, so we didn't have the creme bars to eat the rest of the year.

We went to about five places in our small college town - no creme eggs. So we took the bus to the nearest city and looked all over there. Wal-mart was maybe the eighth or ninth place we tried. They didn't have any single eggs to buy, but they had a spot on the shelves for the boxes of four eggs.

The space on the shelf was empty, except for one box where someone had already opened it and taken some of the eggs. There were two eggs left in the box, one of which had a dent on top. Because we knew the store wasn't selling single eggs - there was no spot for them on any shelves - we figured that the eggs would get thrown out in case there was something wrong with them. We decided the odds of the eggs having something wrong with them were low, so we ate the eggs and went home.

0,"AITA for not giving my sister my old toys for free? | So I (17) used to always give my sister (13) my old toys that I don't need anymore. Most of the time I actually wanted to sell them but then gave them to her when she wanted them. I was okay with it until she then about half a year later just sold them herself. That has happened a lot of times. She gets the toys I don't want, never actually plays with them since she's most of the times too old for them as well and then just sells them herself and gets the money.

I have to mention at this point that I don't think that it's some evil plan of her but that she seriously likes the stuff but quickly looses interest in it. I've talked to her and asked if we could split the money she makes with the toys but she said no. Her argument was that I gave it to her and that I didn't buy most of the toys myself but got them from my mom when I was younger. So with her logic she's not taking money from me but from my mom.

Right now I'm planning on saving money since I wanna buy a new graphics card for my pc so I'm gathering some of my old stuff again to sell it. This time I told my sister that she can't have any of it unless she buys it from me. She got mad at me and said that it's mean of me to expect my own sister to pay money for some old stuff and that my prices are high. To be fair I wouldn't even give her my old books which aren't even worth much but I know that she hates reading so I don't feel like she should get them.

My mom doesn't try to get involved that much into it but she said something to me about how the happiness of my sister should be more important to me than some old books.

And she also asked me stuff like what kind of girl I liked and if I'd ever been in love with a Chinese girl, and she mentioned that she'd posted more pictures on her profile and wanted my opinion of them.

So I told her after looking at them that they were really nice pictures and such. Then she asked me if I thought she looked good in those pictures. So I wrote her saying that I thought she looked very pretty in them, which is true, since she's a cute girl. 

She writes me back saying how she's happy that I think so and says she was worried I thought she was ugly because I hadn't said anything about it at first and that it had made her sad. So I got a notification for that message on my phone which my girlfriend saw and now she acts like I was flirting with this girl and says that I should have told her about being taken. Even though I never flirted with her and also what's the point of telling her since she pretty much lives on the other side of the globe?

Ever since the whole divorce I don’t want my ex brother in law in my home. He’s no longer invited to any events. My sister was upset and said that her kids would be upset to not have their dad at big events like this. She said she hates him for cheating but accepts that she has kids with him so they are stuck together for life. 


But I have the right to not want someone I hate in my home and at my events. I stood by firmly and my husband agreed with me.

So around 3 days before, my brother, 26 years old, demanded one night that he gets the tickets I had scheduled in. I had made plans and invited a friend to the game, so naturally I said no. My mom was a bit mad at this, and wanted me to switch, but I wouldn’t budge. 

My brother came from Vancouver for a couple months and is leaving in December, so he will be going to MANY games while he’s here (he’s already been to a couple in the first couple weeks here). Anyway it’s his favourite team playing this night. 

My mom ended up spending 300$ on tickets for him and his friends to go to the game, but I didn’t really care as long as my seats weren’t altered (I had better seats, he is in the upper deck). Everything was fine

The night of the game me and my friend are watching, having a really good time, and my mom texts me. She asks if I could switch places for a period of the game (this is already a period in).  I thought about it and decided no, why should I switch my seats for him. I told her that, and she got mad, saying I was being rude. I said I’m done and told her that my brother is an asshole (which is true) and won’t get the seats.

0,"AITA for getting a tattoo to commemorate 3 of my 4 grandparents? | I know there's another post on here rn about grandparents and tattoos but it kind of prompted me to ask because this has been a bit of a debate for years now in my family.

Both my grandfathers loved tattoos, they each had a couple, and my grandmother on my mother's side never had tattoos but liked my grandad's tattoos and even paid for my cousin to get one for a 21st birthday present. My paternal grandmother HATED tattoos, saying they were ugly and she didn't get why people would do that to themselves, and joked with my dad that if he ever got a tattoo she'd disown him, which we all knew wasn't true as he already had one and her other son (my uncle) had full sleeves and all over his legs, chest and back.

All 4 grandparents have passed away. My maternal grandfather went first and I got a tattoo to commemorate him (very small, about an inch long and 1/4 inch tall). My paternal grandfather said he loved the tattoo and he was the next to go, so I got one for him directly underneath the first. Then my maternal grandmother went and I got one for her above my maternal grandfather's one, which she actually saw the sketch for and approved before she passed. Then my paternal grandmother passed away last and I didn't get a tattoo for her.

My logic in not getting a tattoo for her was that while the other 3 grandparents either told me the loved the tattoos or I'm sure they *would* have loved them, I knew my paternal grandmother hated them and I felt that it would be disrespectful. She knew that I had tattoos for the others and would never broach the subject, only made a face when it got mentioned, aside from telling me I picked the designs well. I did feel it would be disrespectful to not remember her in some way, as my parents struggled with resources to be with me when I was a kid so both sets of grandparents practically raised me, but my paternal grandmother ended up leaving me her engagement ring in the will so when my wife proposed to me I started wearing my paternal grandmother's ring on a daily basis (which I still do even thought I'm married so the engagement ring isn't strictly needed any more).

My paternal grandmother passed away about 5 years ago, but this debate is reignited every year or so when I see my family. My mum, who was very close with her mother in law, says I've reached a good compromise with the ring, but some family members, my dad and uncle in particular, insists that their mother wouldn't mind having a tattoo of her own and it's ""fair"" to get all 4 grandparents commemorated this way, but I'm just not sure whether she'd have been alright with it.

0,"AITA for snapping at a family member? | I recently graduated med school and got a job in the ER of a fantastic hospital. This hospital is short staffed when it comes to doctors in the ER so I have been working some long shifts usually 12-24 hour shifts.

My family loves coming to me for injuries and stuff before going to the hospital and urgent care because they don’t want to spend money unnecessarily just to be told it’s the cold, a bad bug bite etc..

One particular family member has been coming over right after my 24+ hour shifts. She would have her kid checked out for very minor things that no normal person would even ask about like scraped knees and a busted lip. After I get home from the long shift, I go right to bed because I am dead from exhaustion. Every time this family member comes over, I am effectively woken up out of my sleep. They have been just like the injuries above, scraped knee and busted lip. This time it was another scraped knee, albeit a nasty one but nothing some antiseptic and a big bandaid would cure. Once I bandaged the kid, I sent her outside and the lost it on this family member. I told her “I am tired of being woken up for basic first aid injuries. I have been dealing with patients ALL NIGHT that have severed fingers or a whole hand in an accident or gunshot and stab victims and car crash injuries. I have been awake all day and night helping those who have an actual need for a doctor and am getting sick and tired of being woken up after my long ass shifts for a fucking scraped knee”. She looked shocked and just walked out, she grabbed her kid who was playing in the front yard and left. I had asked the family member not to bring herself or her kid over for med help or advice if it is something that she can truly take care of at home without a doctor, just like before I was a doctor. My mom says I am an asshole for snapping at her but I was beyond exhausted from my shift and tired of being woken up to just administer a bandaid.

Don't know her that well, but have found her a bit standoffish in the past. We were invited to celebrate with other family and friends just after the proposal and of course went to support my son. I guess during the speech my son told her that the forgot what he had planned to say and was improvising, but he had written it out elsewhere. During the celebration, she told him she wanted to read his planned speech. I found that exceptionally rude, since he put so much effort into the proposal and she was in no place to demand the ""perfect"" speech. I said something like ""isn't the speech he gave good enough? why do you need another one?"" and my son got upset with me. I was just trying to stand up for him, but my exwife dragged me out and I didn't want to make a scene, so I left. My exwife called me a name I can't say here when she made me leave and now my son isn't speaking to me right now because he thinks I made it awkward and he doesn't appreciate what I was trying to do for him.

1,"AITA for not allowing my children to eat junk food, watch tv, or play video games? | I have two children a 7 year old son and a 9 year old girl. We don’t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they’re fine with what they have. We also don’t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don’t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we’ve just said no. 

Both our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. 

Sometimes I feel I’m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? ",False,False
0,"AITA not reconnecting with former family/friends and not going to meetings? | Hi guys. I used to be a very severe alcoholic. Among the things I did because of my drinking I went to jail, lost my job, lost my partner, lost my family and lost my friends. I understand \*why\* they did what they did but I still feel resentful that everyone just agreed to abandon me when I needed help. Maybe not the most rational thought but then also feelings aren't rational and I can't force myself to feel a certain way.

In 2016 I had an accident because of my drinking. I won't go into details but I was hospitalized and told I was going to die. Everyone had left me by this point so I was all alone waiting to die. Miraculously I got better. I decided that was it, I'm done drinking. It took a year of physical therapy and more years of getting my shit together but now I have a new partner, new friends, learned a trade and lucked into a good paying job, own a sweet house, my health is better than it has ever been in my adult life, I'm really fucking happy.

I guess recently my ex partner found out where I was at through the grapevine. They tracked me down on facebook and sent me a message saying they were proud of me for working a program and getting sober and wanted to meet up. Now here's the thing, I didn't ""work a program"". I think AA is unscientific, culty and just unhelpful to people trying to get sober. I got sober because I made the choice to stop drinking and stuck to that choice every day, that's all. Apart from that I also don't want anything to do with the people from my old life because I'm still hurting from being abandoned and left to die. I thanked them for their kind words but said that I got sober without any help from AA or from my old support system and that I would not be interested in meeting with them or anyone else.

Soon enough my parents knocked on my door. No idea how the fuck they figured out where I lived, they wouldn't answer that question. But they found me. They had some guy I didn't know in tow and said that he was a member of AA and wanted to take me there to get better. I said no and that I was doing fine without it. He said clearly not because I'm resisting the idea of getting help so hard. I was really pissed off at this guy I don't know making judgments about me and told him to get fucked and that I got sober my own way and don't need his scientifically debunked religious group to help me. He said that I clearly needed help and started explaining what a dry drunk is (I already know that it's just an AA meme word for ""sober person who I don't like"") and said that in order to be truly sober I needed to have a ""spiritual awakening"" and help other people get sober. I laughed and said good luck with all that made up bullshit and shut the door in all their faces.

0,"WIBTA If I refused to share my late fiancée life insurance payout with her parents | My fiancée tragically passed away a few months back. I'm currently in the process of sorting various matters out. Two of these are the Mortgage and Life Insurance. 

I should firstly make it clear that because we weren't married and had no children I am not next of kin, her parents are.

I discovered today that because the way the Mortgage was set up, I am due to inherit the full mortgage debt to pay back but only half the house, the remainder of the house will go to her parents. This is frustrating for a number of reason, firstly when my fiancee and I set up the Mortgage I recall being asked this question and I don't believe that is the option we chose. I can't prove that so it is what it is. Secondly, the house is hers and mine, no-one else's.. We designed it from the ground up, everything in it is hours of work by us, to now have to share that seems wrong. Thirdly, I truly dont believe this what she would have wanted, it certainly isn't what I would have wanted for her but they're spinning it as ""If this is how she set it up, she must have wanted us to get the house."" And finally I got on really well with her family, I feel this has made the relationship extremely difficult to maintain. 

I'm not sure if it's relevant as to whether IATA but her family are well off, a lot more so than myself or my family. They're not stinking rich but they have a large portfolio of properties and money just isn't an issue for them. I'm by no means struggling, but I earn enough to pay the bills and that's about it.. I can barely afford them now I'm paying them alone.

Also, possibly relevant possibly not.. every single asset of hers has gone to her parents and I have not said a word. This is the law and that's fine. It probably equates to around £20,000 in total, I have not asked for nor received a penny of this and I am completely comfortable with that fact.

Now, we had joint life insurance which means I'm due a payout equal to the remainder of the mortgage. To me, this is my money to do with as I please. I paid the premiums to cover my mortgage in case the worst should happen, which it did. My solution is that I either give her parents half the money we've paid off the house and they sign it over to me or we sell the house and share whatever money is raised. Either way, I keep the life insurance money.

Their solution is that I pay off the full mortgage and we share the house 50/50. To me this is completely out of the question, why would I pay for them to own half of my house. But am I just being extremely selfish keeping the full amount for myself?",False,False
1,"AITA for getting mad at my husband for getting food too? | This happened about a year ago, but came up recently and I don’t know if I was an AH for how I reacted. We’ve since divorced so no need to tell me that it sounds like a bad relationship. 

My husband (now ex), John, and I knew we were very different financially before we got married, so we regularly discussed finances and made sure we had specific written budgets. John is a spender - eats out nearly every day, gets nicest/name brand everything, regularly updates wardrobe, etc. I’m a saver. I buy maybe five new items of clothing each year, I don’t eat fast food, and I’m used to putting away hundreds of dollars in savings each month.

We both had full time jobs with comparable pay and John had a side job as well. We decided to combine our full time income that we budgeted together and agreed that John could use his side income for whatever he wanted, so that usually went to food and clothes (things we budgeted for together, but not enough for his lifestyle in his opinion). He’d often blow through our joint money too, but I tried to be patient with him since I knew we both weren’t used to having our spending affect someone else. 

I took out cash for something and ended up with $10 leftover. I told John and he said I should treat myself with that. I got excited because I seriously never got to spend money on myself and decided I just wanted a chocolate milkshake with it. John tells me I deserve one so I say I’m going to go buy one and he insists on driving me. I don’t think anything of it until I go to order and John places an order for a full meal and more. I ask him what he’s doing and he says that he’s using his personal money so I shouldn’t worry about it. I got upset because he eats out every day so this was normal for him, but a milkshake was supposed to be special for me. He got angry at me and called me ungrateful. I retaliated and yelled at him for not just letting me have my own thing for once. I watched him spend money on himself every day, only ever once using his personal money on something for me (a book), so I was just hurt that he couldn’t not get food for once to let me feel like that was a special occasion for me.

Essentially, me and my bf said that we were going to go to an escape room when they first started to become popular. Life got ahead of us, and being long distance meant that we never got a chance to. He and his family ended up going to one for one of their birthdays, and whilst I was slightly upset about not being able to experience it together for the first time for us both, it was no big deal, as it wasn't the one that we had shown an interest in together. A year or so has passed, and we still haven't got round to going together. He then mentioned to me that his friend is planning on going to the exact one we planned to go to for his birthday, and my boyfriend said he didn't really want to go, but probably will. I had a bit of a moan at him about me always missing out on things, to which he called me unreasonable, so I dropped it. I don't very often complain at him for doing things without me, but he does quite often go places we planned to try out together, and then brushes it off when I am upset about it. I don't care that he does things which we have already done, or that he sees his friends or whatever, just that he can't seem to wait for me to try new things. I know the escape room situation is different, as he didn't get to choose what it is, but not only can he not really afford it, but he doesn't really even want to go with his friends. So, am I being unreasonable by not wanting him to go with his friends? I just feel it would waste a plan which we want to do together, for the sake of not disappointing his friend who he does everything with all the time.",False,False
1,"AITA For falling out with my brother's wife? | Basically this has been going on for a few years now, I haven't spoken to her for some time and my parents said I was probably over reacting and should let it go now . I dated a guy for a year who was my sister in laws best friend. He was super nice at first and then became a leech. He started borrowing hundreds of dollars from me and my niave ass kept loaning it. He eventually owed me over $2000 - honestly, I'd stopped keeping track after a bit because you just don't expect your boyf to take advantage like that. 

It got towards the end of our relationship where I was sending him money for food and he would recieve it and go and sit in a bar with his friends and stop texting me back. I decided to end the relationship due to feeling like this was going to be vicious circle and I had started having feelings for another man who was self sufficient and made time for me. There was no cheating, I ended everything properly and was honest.
He didn't like this and decided this was enough to not pay the money back - said i deserved it. 

He blocked me on everything so I couldn't contact so I asked brothers wife to speak to him please because it isn't fair, i worked hard for my money and he didn't have a job through our entire relationship. She said she didn't want to get involved and got really short with me and said I shouldnt of asked her to contact him and I was putting her in an awkward position.

I said that she was condoning his behaviour and a good friend would called their friends out on their BS and doing so didn't mean getting involved, just reassuring her friend he's pulling a D*** move.  My brother then ended up getting involved and it started a lot of arguments until he finally came back to me and said i was in the wrong for upsetting his wife asking for help and told me it was my own fault for lending money to someone in the hopes of them paying it back. 

I never received the money and brother's wife and ex boyf are still best friends and I haven't spoken to wife, brother or ex in over 2 years now.

1,"AITA for intentionally making a meal my friend is allergic to? | At 17 I studied abroad and was immediately labeled as the ""rich foreign student"" within my university (because of my country's currency things were cheap)
I quickly made friends and started dating one of the locals. He and I had our own set of friends but we'd all hangout together. 
At the time I started getting close to someone i saw as a sister, let's call her Emy. She lives in the uni hostels and I rented a studio apt next to uni but because we spent all our time together she just moved in with me. She paid for nothing (no rent, bills, expenses) I didnt mind because it wasnt a big deal. As I said things were cheap.
My boyfriend, his friends and my friends would hangout at my place most of the time. One specific friend we'll call him Jack started a thing with Emy which led to her having feelings for him.
Emy was in a different faculty and had her own schedule so she couldnt spend time with us most of the time. Because of how often they came I started to get to know the type of person Jack is. In summary hes a playboy.
I tried warning Emy about Jack and she said that I was overreacting and that it's fine for him to see other people because ""they're not official yet"", but she was very protective of him.
Whenever we'd go out (without Emy) theres always a new girl with jack and everytime I was the one paying for everything. For the first few times i was trying to be nice but then it became a habit. I always end up pay for 4 people (me, my boyfriend, jack and any new girl he'd bring) and if they invited more friends id pay for them too. This took a toll on my finances where I couldn't afford necessities.
On top of that Jack started a habit of coming to my place just to have meals and meet his girls/hook ups. I never said anything about it because he my bfs friend.
Until I went broke at the end of the month and had to live off whatever scraps I had in my fridge. I knew my boyfriend was coming over with Jack which means he'd try to eat whatever I have left so when cooking I added some things I knew he was allergic to. Emy saw me adding weird things to my food and asked what I was doing so I said that I knew jack was allergic and didnt want him to eat anything I'm making.
(It's not like I was gonna make him eat it, he usually asks if he can have some and saying no was always an issue to me so I said ""Oh no I added *whatever he's allergic to*. I didnt know you were coming and that's the way I like to make this meal, sorry""
Emy. Freaked. Out.
She said I was petty, disgusting, cheap, for not letting him eat at my place. ""Food is food"" and that I'm ""trash for what I did."" She never took in consideration what I was going through financially because of these people, including her.

I go to a very demanding high school and also work part time. I’m also working on college apps and building my portfolio for them so needless to say I’m very busy all the time. 

My parents have been suffocating my entire life and like to act like once I leave work and school there’s nothing left to do when I’m reality I have multiple essays and projects going on at any given time. They were getting on my case for not cleaning my room and I explained everything above to my mom and I felt like she understood but Saturday after getting home from a particularly long shift I found my room completely rearranged with things missing. I was furious because I knew it was my mom and went to confront her but she was on the phone so she told me to leave her alone. I kind of told her off before leaving but Sunday night we got into an actual fight. I told her she invaded my privacy and threw my stuff away and she tried to argue that she told me to clean my room but I didn’t listen so she did it herself. I told her that I already told her I’d do it when I got time and that she had no right to go through my shit. 

I found out from my dad she also read through some personal letters from my girlfriend and my friend. Along with throwing away some of them.

1,"AITA for not letting this student become a cheerleader again, despite her having a good reason for missing cheer camp? | I’m a high school cheer coach and I need to know if I did the right thing here.

One of my girls lost their dad in May. It was really terrible for her and we were there for her, as a team. Her mom spoke to me privately and said that her daughter was not going to be up for going to cheer camp. Now, at my school, this is required for the kids to be able to rejoin (or even tryout) for the squad in the fall. (It’s the same for football). I had a dilemma on my hands. While I understood why this girl wasn’t going to be up for a week of workouts, learning new stunts, dances, jumps and techniques. That being said, if she missed it, she would be very much behind come fall. I asked the mother if her daughter still wanted to cheer and she said yes, but she wasn’t up for camp.

I debated this for a while and spoke to the head of the athletics department, along with the school principal. They left it up to me, but the athletic head said it was a lot different than giving say an extension on homework. Letting her miss it and the allowing her to rejoin the team wouldn’t be fair to other girls who took the time to go.

Eventually, I went to the mom and said to give her daughter time to think it over and explained why. We had time to wait. In time, however, the mom confirmed, the daughter was just not up to it. I said I understood; however, this was what it meant.

I got a very upset e-mail from the mother, saying I was taking out her daughter’s grief on her. I tried to explain that it just wasn’t fair to the other girls and it wasn’t the same as other extensions. I said that she could try again the following year and that I was here for her further.

I feel terrible right now and like I said, I need to know what you guys think. Am I being an ass here?",False,False
1,"AITA for freaking out at my girlfriend because I thought she cheated on me | throw away because people know my reddit account

so yeah. I've been dating this girl for six months. I met her during winter semester, and immediately fell for how insanely cute she was. I always felt like I had to have my guard up because a lot of guys would always hit on her or ask for her number. She was suddenly on her phone a lot, ignoring me, whatever. She went ""shopping"" a lot. I was watching over her shoulder one day and I saw that my brother's name popped up on her screen. My stomach started to churn. I've been cheated on before, I know the warning signs. There is \*absolutely no reason she needs to be talking to my brother\*. If she needs to talk to him, she can talk to him through me. That's what I thought at the time anyways. I tried to go through her phone, but I didn't know the password and I didn't want to disable it because then she would have known that I was on to her. 

I tried to catch her in her lies, she wouldn't give me straight answers about where she was going, and I had enough. I confronted her yesterday. I waited for her to be done with classes, and I told her that she needed to come over immediately. I told her I knew about her and my brother. Immediately she looked guilty. I'll admit, I was pissed, and lost control. I started yelling at her, I did call her a slut for messing around with my brother, and I told her that we were done. Then she started to cry, asking me what I was talking about. I told her that I saw my brothers name on her phone. She took her phone out, unlocked it, pulled up her texts between her and my brother. They were planning a surprise party for me at my grandparent's house, this Saturday night. I got even angrier because that didn't make sense to me. How could a surprise birthday party be more important that me? What I mean is, why did she go to such an extent and make me think she was cheating on me? Of course I would think she was cheating on me. If some guy saw his girlfriend texting his brother behind his back and not telling him where she was going, I think that any rational man would think that she was fooling around. And the texts also don't explain why she couldn't just tell me where she was really going. 

So yeah, party's off. Everyone thinks I'm an asshole. My brother's mad that I didn't try to talk to him. I don't see why I should, its my girlfriend that was texting him. I just don't see it. I think I had every reason to think she was cheating on me, that's not my fault. I'm allowed to be angry, especially since I've been cheated on before. But she doesn't want to talk to me anymore, and wont answer my texts. Bullet dodged, I guess? So reddit, am I really the asshole here?",False,False
1,"AITA for saying ""See you next year"" to a teacher who is getting let go? | So this teacher (I will call him R) was new at my school this year. 

Immediately he tried to impose his own way of teaching and grading on us (the students) which was very different that anything we had ever experienced. You were expected to do things his way, and even if his was was wrong, which people pointed out to him, you were still expected to use it. R also took points off for scratch work that he didn't like, and tried to take off as many points as possible on the tests, quizzes, and homeworks. Every student he had with no exception was subjuct to this.

R also took forever to grade our assignments. We took a test the week before spring break, and got it back ~6 weeks later. He also refused to go over it with anyone. R never offered help outside of the classroom and was hostile whenever asked for extra help.

The administration took notice and we were informed that R was not coming back next year. Needless to say, we were overjoyed about this. Since the announcement, R completely checked out, he just wrote notes on the board, barely talked during class,and went to Disneyland instead of going to one of the review days for exams.

Yesterday, as I was walking out Of R's classroom for the last time, I called ""See you next year!"" over my shoulder. My friends have told me that I'm the asshole for this, but I don't think so.

Obligatory on mobile so formatting might be screwed up :) 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a few months now. Things are going well but he has a big problem with how much I use my phone. I agree that I do use it a lot, and that scrolling through reddit or twitter all day is an addiction. However, there are a lot of useful things I use my phone for as well. 

I have a set morning routine where I listen to a daily news podcast, do the NYT crossword, and do my Duolingo French lessons. This is whole routine takes about an hour in the morning. I understand that he wants to talk to me in the mornings and I end up on my phone, but the routine helps me. I feel much more productive throughout the day because I start it off doing something productive. 

After I’m done with this routine, I agree that using my phone beyond that is harmful and I need to reduce the amount I spend on reddit and Twitter drastically. He says that I should do my routine in the evening or before sleeping. This makes no sense to me, because I need to limit my screen time before sleeping, and also listening to the previous days news in the evening, or doing the crossword when I’m tired from the day doesn’t seem logical. 

My boyfriend says that even though I’ve been admitting for a while that there’s a problem I haven’t been working towards fixing it. He says that a big reason for my addiction is that I spend an hour in the morning on my phone. I agree that it might have an effect but I don’t think that changing that to a nightly routine will help.

0,"AITA for holding this grudge against my dad from a decade ago | Ten years ago my stepmom accused me of stealing money from my stepbrother. I was 19 at that time, my stepbrother is a month younger. The whole thing was a set up, my stepmom told me it was. She and I had a fight the day before and she told me to just watch what she can do. The next day I got back from work and was met with the accusation that I've stolen thousands of dollars from my stepbrother. My parents kept our money in a lock box in their room with the key hidden. I also had a bank account so I had my own debit card for gas and a little spending money but 90% of my money went into the box. Stepmom claimed thousands of dollars were missing from my stepbrothers money in the lock box. After days of fighting it was determined that there was no proof I stole it but I would be punished anyway. My dad sat me down at the kitchen table to tell me my punishment as my stepmom stood behind him with the biggest smile,dancing and flipping me off. First was that they were cutting off paying for my college. They had already paid for my first and second semester at a community college but they took that money back out of my money. They also took away my debit card and gave me a strict allowance of only gas money to get to work, this included keeping track of my odometer calculating it down to the mile. This was to go on until I moved out which I did about a year later. 
  News was spread around that I was a thief and friends and family distanced themselves, plus I could not go out with no money and being tracked. I was doing well in college but I was not allowed to go back until I moved out and could have control of my own money. There are many reasons I rarely have communicated with my parents the past 10 years but this is one of the bigger ones. My dad has been trying to get me to meet with him and talk things out, mostly because he wants to see his grandaghter. My brothers car broke down so Ive been giving him rides to my parents house. This time I got stuck there talking to my dad. He asked me whats going on with me ignoring him and everything so I tried to talk. First thing I brought up was the situation explained above and my dad and brother laughed out loud at me. Dad said he cant believe I still think about that and that its a long time to hold something agaist him. I told him if we cant even get passed that there's no point talking and left. My brother texted me throughout the night and today trying to get me to come back and talk more, he says 10 years is a long time to hold that against my dad and I should leave it in the past. They say even with what happened its my own fault for not finishing college and moving out. Just thinking about it, 10 years does sound like a long time to hold on to somthing and plenty of people do put themselves through college under worse circumstances. So now im wondering if I am wrong to hold this particular grudge from ten years ago against him.

1,"AITA for making a girl do a TIKTOK warmup in PE? | So I am a high school gym teacher, and at the beginning of the day everyday we do exercises. Thing is, recently someone else in the class had recommended to me that we do something from TIKTOK to do for one of our exercises. And I like what she shows me so the next day I tell the class that we are doing a new exercise. And as we are doing it I see a girl standing not doing it. 

I ask her to come out in the hallway out of the gym with me and told her why she was not doing it with the class. She told me that she thought it was stupid because it was from TIKTOK and said that TIKTOK was stupid and that it should die, she also said that she felt humiliated at just the thought of doing it. I told her that I didn’t care and whatever I tell her to do she has to do it and I don’t care how she feels about TIKTOK and she needs to suck it up and do what I tell her to. 

I then bring her out to the gym and everyone is still doing them and when she goes back she is still not doing them and standing there uncomfortably. After the exercises I bring her out again and tell her for disobeying me I will call her parents and give her a referral for refusal to obey. She then started crying and begging me not to tell her parents and the referral honestly I don’t really care. I call her parents and give her the referral and send her to the office.

1,"AITA for deciding to go to the museum alone while my friends go to eat? | First time posting. I'm on the phone so sorry for any form mistake. 

Here's the story. We're group of 5 visiting Bangkok right now. I'm the pushover one so when they planned the trip duration and everything, I didn't voice my ideas and let them decide so whenever I raise my voice, other will reject it. So, at the end, we have 5 days in Bangkok alone which is very long for this boring city. 

Since they're kinda into shopping, everyday is shopping for them and I'm getting tired and said i was so bored of it. They spent almost of their money on shopping and eating so no budget left for tours or anything fun. 

Anyway, this just happened. Today is the 4th day in Bangkok and since they either have everything they want to shop or running out of money, we decided to go to museum and a pagoda today. However, last night they partied hard and woke up very late so we only started at 12.00 after lunch. After the meal, they said that we should go to the museum first because of the closing time and not so sure if the museum we aimed to do open today (it's Sunday here). I told them to check and some of them said it's close so off we went to the Pagoda. 

After coming back from the pagoda, they said they want to go eating dessert. I was full since it's only 2 or 3 hours after we had lunch so I told them I would walk back to the hotel. The thing is that the museum is on my way of walking back and I saw it's still open so I walked in and visited it myself.  After like 2.5 hours, I came back and saw no one there at the hotel yet. I opened my phone (I dont buy myself 4g sim card, only 3 of my friends did) and they have been sending the text that the museum does open and waiting for me to go. However, when i told them I've been to that already, they pissed and told me I'm the AH since they're waiting for me and I didn't wait for them. 

Actually, I don't see any problem since they were out doing thing they like which is eating. Me just wanted time for myself alone and walking back and happened to see the museum by myself is now being called AH. So, what do you guys think? AITA?",False,False
1,"Aita for telling my girlfriend to stop picking up earthworms in front of my friends? | There's literally no way of writing this without it sounding weird but there you go...

My girlfriend (26F) and I (27M) have been dating for 3 months. She's super cool and it's all going really well, so I thought it was time to introduce her to my friends from school back home. Now, some things to note about my girlfriend: she's quite petite, probably about 5ft, and she dresses like - I quote - a 'kids' TV presenter.' She also gets very excited about things very easily. This means that she often gets read as being a lot younger than she actually is, which can be annoying but is also hilarious as she's probably the most intelligent person I've ever met. It's an odd contradiction but I think it's really cute. 

When we got to my hometown, we decided to meet my friends at a local park which has a lake and a set of gardens. It had been raining the day before and the ground was still pretty wet, but we planned on walking around the lake with my friends, because we all live life on the edge. We got there and everyone seemed to like my girlfriend and they all got on well.

It changed when she noticed that there were lots of earthworms that had got themselves stranded on the wet pavement. My girlfriend is a complete softie when it comes to worms and snails and she always saves them whenever she sees them. It's a personality quirk. She has a folder of photos on her phone of all the worms and snail 'friends' she makes and she carries a bottle of hand sanitiser with her at all times, just in case. 

So as soon as she realised that there were worms that needed saving, she got right to work, and just knelt down right there on the ground in front of my friends and started picking up the worms, literally talking to them and saying stuff like (I wish I were kidding) ""let's sort you out, you've got yourself into a real situation here.""

My friends all started laughing then, and I honestly couldn't tell if they were laughing with or at her, so I said to her ""hey, do you think you could give the worm stuff a rest?"" and she said ""just let me pick up a couple more,"" to which I said ""let's pay attention to my human friends, not your worm ones, like adults do,"" and that made her stop. She looked kind of embarrassed and I felt bad, and then all my friends told her that we could have a worm rescuing session if she wanted, but she seemed reluctant. 

My friends all told me later that they really liked her, and they thought the worm thing was cute, but she's stopped showing me photos of the little critters on her phone now and I'm worried I was a total asshole and need to apologise. The reason I'm not sure I'm TA is that I told her to stop because I was worried my friends were laughing at her, so I said it to protect her, not shame her. Aita?",False,False

The employee asked if I needed help, I distinctly said “no thanks, I will let you know if I need any help.”  I planned to discreetly select a sugar free box of chocolates, as I am pre-diabetic. My kiddo asked me if they have a kind of chocolates I know she loves, one I *knew* they make a *sugar-free version* of that I wanted to steer my kid to. Unfortunately, the employee answered the question my kid asked *me* and pointed to the version *with* sugar. I explained to my kid I want to get a box of *this* kind *not *that* kind knowing there will be no significant taste difference, and that she and I can share them. I didn’t specifically tell kiddo they were sugar free: I knew she’d like them and didn’t want to make this a teachable moment. 

At the register the employee says “just so you know, these have NO Sugar in them” in a not-at-all-positive-tone. My kiddo is crestfallen because to her sugar=yummy.  I say “I know that, and I wish you hadn’t said that out loud, because if you look at my kid she is now nearly in tears.”  I pay anyway and notice they have a sink and I have an empty water cup. I ask if they can fill the cup, since kiddo is thirsty.  The employee says they *don’t have any water.* I say incredulously “you don’t wash your hands?!” And she replies that of course she does, but all they have is tap water, and I’m like, “yes, that’s what I want, please.”  Thankfully she fills the cup.  Meanwhile I’m trying to comfort my kid, who is quietly crying. Another employee comes over and assures my kid the sugar free kind tastes just as good.  With this new employee, I’m say, “you know what, can I just return these or exchange them?” The first employee interjects that they don’t do returns because it could have been opened. It is a *sealed box* and I say “are you serious? Clearly nothing has been opened.” The other employee says under these circumstances they will exchange it. I explain I just wanted to discreetly buy the sugar free kind due to my health condition so we could share.  My kid hears this and tearfully says it’s fine to keep the sugar free kind. At this point I just want to walk away, so I tell them not to bother with the exchange. We leave the store and I tell kiddo I’m sorry about getting the not-sugar kind, but they are the kind I can eat too, so we can share.

1,"AITA for letting my kids sing the song from the show ""The Witcher"" even though my husband hates it? | Ok so I know this seems really dumb, but hear me out:

My husband (44M) and I (42F) have two children (13M and 15F). We recently watched the Netflix show ""The Witcher"" as a family, and enjoyed it a lot. Our kids especially loved it, and actually rewatched the show together immediately after we finished it. 

Since watching the show, the kids have been singing this song that the bard character sings on the show (""toss a coin to your Witcher"") over and over and over. It's kind of a meme in our house now, I guess. I personally thought it was funny, but my husband quickly got irritated by it. He asked them over and over to sing something else, because he was tired of hearing the same single line of a song a million times (they don't sing the whole song, they just sing ""toss a coin to your Witcher, oh valley of plenty, oh valley of plenty""). Finally, he told them that every time he heard them sing that song, he'd take a dollar out of their weekly allowance. 

I told him that I thought that was ridiculous, but he said that he thought our kids needed to learn to respect other people and not purposely do things when they knew other people found it frustrating. I don't think the kids were actually that upset about the allowance thing – they just thought their dad was a bit of a buzzkill. But I don't think our kids need to be taught that having fun and enjoying things are causes for punishment, just because their father is apparently easily annoyed. Also, I don't think he was genuine about wanting to teach them any sort of ""lesson"" – I think he just wanted them to shut up and thought lording their money over them was a good way to achieve that.  

So, I told him and the kids that I'd replace any allowance their father tries to take away from them. They've quickly resumed singing the song – with perhaps even more fervor than before. But my husband is very irritated with me for undermining him. I don't think that's fair of him though, since we always make decisions about punishments/allowance as a couple, and he made the original threat without consulting me.

I know this seems pretty low-stakes and silly, but I am genuinely questioning my stance on this, since my husband does have a point that we should teach the kids not to knowingly annoy people.

Teletubbies.

My sister meanwhile who was 7 about this time hated it when I was watching Teletubbies at home because it was the ""cool"" show. She thought they were creepy and scary.

Anyone one summer day she was kind of annoying me while I was watching TV before her bedtime so during a commercial I went to her room and came back quick. I told her I heard the Teletubbies giggling so I looked under her bed and they were hiding there.

She freaked out and told my parents. They kept telling her that the Teletubbies don't exist in real life so they can't be under her bed but she refused to listen. So she ended up sleeping in their bed that night and the next few days. Needless to say they weren't happy with me.

Then she blocked me on FB, found a new bff and that was that. 

2 years later, she says she misses me and wants to hang out. 

Then everytime we make plans she bails at the last minute and later I see posts of her with her new bff. 

Well this time she really messed up. Sold all her stuff, moved halfway around the world for a guy, only to realize it wasn't going to work. 

She made it back to our country but has no money and no place to live, no car. 

She asked if she could use my car or live with me. 

Legally she could live with her ex here in town because her name is on the mortgage and they could each have their own floor. 

She could live with her new bff just out of town but would need a car. 

She could live with me in town and not need a car at all.

Now that I'm sober I notice how immature and self centered she is, how she's never had my back on the big things. I think she just wanted someone to drink with.

Of course my step son was deeply upset since it's the house he grew up in, but my boyfriend assured me that someone who is his age and *still* living in his childhood home is wrong and should be out by now. Everyone I know (apart from my step son) moved out no later than 21. I just want him out so my boyfriend and I can get on with our lives.

0,"AITA for cutting my dad out of my life and ignoring my family’s wishes to keep the peace? | Throwaway. On mobile, so apologies if formatting is bad. 

My mum and dad divorced when I (21F) was six. She found out he was having another affair with an eighteen y/o. This was the second time she had come to find he was cheating and my mum was pregnant as well, so the divorce was extremely messy and traumatic.

They never went through court for a custody order because my dad didn’t care enough to bother. When my sister was born, my mum struggled to look after all three of us (my brother has autism) so they set up a plan that we’d stay with him every other weekend. Most times, we weren’t with him. We’d go to my nanna’s.

He and his girlfriend got married, had two kids, then divorced, which was a relief for me and my brother as there were times she was abusive to us and he looked past it. He then got into a relationship with a woman who we’ll call Sarah, and they’re still together till this day. In fact, when I was fifteen, still on the schedule of seeing my dad twice every month for three hours even though he didn’t have a job at the time, he moved to Scotland with Sarah. I’m in the UK.

He used to call every other Saturday and we’d speak for around half an hour before I’d eventually make up an excuse to hang up because he would always just talk about himself. Then about three years ago he stopped. He never called, messaged or anything unless it was a birthday or Christmas. 

The other day, my sister texted me to say my dad had rang her and she asked him why he hasn’t spoken to me in over two years, and he told her that he had “a busy life”. I decided to block what contact I had for him and my mum was completely supportive with that decision. 

My nanna, auntie, grandad, and practically every other family member are not so pleased. We are a very big and close family so I wasn’t surprised when word got out that I had removed him entirely. They’re upset and say that I should’ve contacted him as well, ‘it’s a two way street’. I told them I’m his daughter and, even though I’m an adult now, I wasn’t before and he still neglected me then. Even when my mum texted him informing him of my declining mental health, he didn’t respond.

0,"AITA for asking my pregnant SIL to leave the family Christmas gathering? | Okay so based on title I totally sound like an asshole but hear me out. 

So this year is our turn to host the family Christmas party at our home. We invited not only my SOs side but also my side as well. Overall it was around 20ish people in our home today for gift giving and typical American Christmas celebrating. Drinks were shared, food broken, the whole shebang. 

Amongst my SOs side of the family was his pregnant sister. She, I think, was due maybe a week or so ago? But really its just been ticking time bomb for her little one to arrive. Everybodys excited to meet the baby! 

Now our problem is that SIL came to the party with contractions and was obviously in labor (I know this because Im a mom myself - once you know, you know). Every 20 minutes or so she would start having pains and would make noises to pass the contractions. At first it wasnt so bad; I understand how sucky it is and you dont want to go to the hospital too soon because they'll just send you right home. But then it became almost obnoxious. I feel terrible for saying that but it really was. A lot of my family members and some of hers were glancing around like WTF? Go home and do that in private. 

After a while it became apparent that it was making everybody uncomfortable and even my MIL reccommend that she rest at home before it gets too late. She refused and said she was fine. In the middle of the kids opening their presents she went into pain again and this time she even screamed for a second. I then discreetly pulled her husband to the side and told them to leave. I did it politely (""Hey I appreciate you guys for being here but I think its time to go. I dont want you guys to give birth in our kitchen! lol"").

After I said that her husband got angry and quickly got her and the kids packed up. She  visibly upset and before heading out called me a bitch and said that I ruined Christmas for her. A few of their sides family members gave me dirty looks and left soon after.

Im torn on this: I wanted everybody to have a good day but it was very distracting and obnoxious to have her around. I feel bad but still.

1,"AITA for telling my skinny friend to stop calling herself curvy? | I have a friend in my main circle that has recently started describing herself as curvy. She’s not though. She put on a few pounds recently to become barely above underweight with chicken hips still and thinks she has curves because she just got fake knockers. She keeps saying things like “it feels great to be curvy”, “guys have started noticing my curves”, etc. She hasn’t referred to us as curvy nor have we categorized our own figures aloud. 


No one has said anything to her about it for over a month, but we do talk about it when she’s not around. Some of us think she’s saying that to make us actual curvy girls feel fat. I’m actually curvy unlike her. I have a natural hourglass figure. 


Today, that friend said to me and another actual curvy friend “being curvy is great but us curvy girls got to always watch what we eat or we’d become straight up fat in no time”. I told her “yo chicken hips, you’re not even close to curvy like [name of that curvy friend] and I”. She said “calm down [my name], there’s different degrees of curvy”. I said “stop calling yourself curvy since it’s making us actual curvy girls feel fat”. She said “alright chill girl”. Hopefully she doesn’t call herself curvy again.",False,False
0,"AITA for “not taking responsibility” for my bipolar? | I struggled for 10 years with undiagnosed bipolar. During this time I drank heavily, made bad decisions. I had three manic episodes, the last of which was so bad, so traumatic... I finally understood that I needed to do anything and everything to get well. 

I was finally officially diagnosed with bipolar and CPTSD. I started intensive therapy, completely quit drinking, basically did a 180 and have stayed on the straight and narrow ever since. I have no desire to go back to where I was, ie pick up a drink. The meds work great, and I am stable and better than I ever have been.

Turns out though, my very compétant psych team is pretty convinced that my mom is a narcissist and that her constant emotional abuse definitely caused my CPTSD and maybe in fact lead to my bipolar. Although I made bad decisions during my years of being sick, I want to be clear that I never DID anything TO anyone in my family, (Stealing, violence, etc) though I definitely said some things I regret, that I have apologized for. 

I can completely understand how from my fam’s  perspective it was difficult to see me in that state, however as they are stuck in this narcissistic family unit, they can’t seem to grasp that my mom actually played a big part in it.

In any event, I have only ever wanted a good relationship with them, and I though that getting sober and on the right track would have helped with that, but it actually has made relations worse, namely with my little sister who thinks I’m “playing the victim” blaming bipolar  for my years of bad behavior, also for blaming my mom for her abuse. 

For me, I have apologized for my past actions and words. In my view the best way to show my remorse is to take my recovery seriously. I can’t change the past but I can work towards a happy and healthy future. My sister sees this rational as me not owning my past actions, and I resent her, what I see as ignorance about my bipolar (she refuses to look into it to try to understand better).

1,"AITA for speaking to my sister about my wife's financial concerns for an event that my wife said she couldn't afford to attend? | My (31M) wife (34F) was recently invited to my younger sister's (29F) hen do happening this month. She showed me the invite, and almost immediately stated to me that there was no way she could go as she had no money and wouldn't be able to afford it, and how everyone else will have money to do things and she won't.

&#x200B;

(She's concerned as she only works a few hours each weekend, and the money she gets often goes (but not always) for household/kid's needs. She has access to our ""joint account"", which is where my salary goes in, and which pays for all rent/bills/car payments/everything else.)

&#x200B;

I would love for her to go, especially as she's been wanting some time away from the kids and normal routine, so I messaged my older sister (40F) who is planning the hen do and asked how much money my wife would need for the day, so that my wife would know what to expect/budget for. She replied that it's a very low key affair, mostly at her home, but one part will have a small cost and she'd be happy to pay for my wife because she'd love for her to come. I replied asking to know any costs and that I'd contribute as well if needed. It ends up that the cost would be less than £20.

&#x200B;

Yesterday my wife went through my phone (no issue there: we have nothing to hide) and sees the messages between myself and my sister. Immediately she goes into a rant saying things like ""I can't believe you've done that, I'm not a charity case, you've made me feel so small, you'd hate it if my family did this to you, I'm so embarrassed"" and stormed off and gave me the silent treatment/refused all physical affection all night, and was clearly in a foul mood with me this morning.

&#x200B;

Today she mentioned that she had asked her coworkers about it (although she had phrased it in terms of me controlling what money she could or couldn't have) and of course they all sided with her. She was still adamant that I had ""done wrong"" by ""going behind her back"" to have me or my sister pay for her, and that she wasn't a ""charity case"". She then said that she'd pay for it herself anyway, or that she'd just use the joint account(!).  By the end of the argument, she was in a foul mood, and I'm back in the doghouse again. My argument to her was that my sister's generosity was borne out of no bad intention, and that me getting involved was was also not ill-intentioned.

&#x200B;

My initial feeling was that my wife is being pretty rude and ungrateful, but I understand that there's always some embarrassment when you feel that you can't afford something that someone then pays for you.  However, if that thing is paid for out of generosity and love and affection, then why not be grateful and not look a gift horse in the mouth. I'd love it if someone paid for a day out for me!

0,"AITA for having a family removed from a private lake neighborhood? | I live in a private neighborhood built around a lake. Essentially, the lake is in the middle and a road runs in a circle around it with houses on the road. Everyone who buys a house here pays an HOA fee to help take care of the neighborhood. Fixing docks, stocking the lake with fish, clubhouse maintenance, etc. Not a big body of water, about 1.5 miles around. There are lots of signs, including a big one right when you drive in, saying that the neighborhood is private for members and guests only. 

In the past month, all homeowners have gotten letters from the HOA saying to be on the lookout for people who don't living coming to fish since a lot of public parks have been closed. If we see someone who doesn't live here and doesn't have lake tags signifying that they are a guest, we should tell them to leave or call the maintenance guy who will handle it. You can see where this is going.

A week ago I leave my house and see a pickup pulled up to the dock in front on my house. There is a guy (dad) and his two small kids there fishing. I have never seen them before, so I go up to them and strike up a conversation. I ask where they live and they say that they don't live here but heard about the lake from one of their friends who also doesn't live there. We talk for a few more minutes and I tell the dad (whispering so the kids don't hear) that this is a private neighborhood and that they technically aren't allowed to fish here if they aren't a member or guest. I then say that they must not have known that and tell them to finish fishing for a day. I even offered to give them lake tags if anyone else hasseles them about being there. The guy thanks me, says he didn't know, and continues fishing the next few hours that I could tell after I went back inside. 

Two days later, I am going for a walk around the lake and I see the same family fishing at another dock (not in front of my house). I ask the dad if he has tags and he says he doesn't, but that his kids want to fish and they aren't hurting anyone. I say I understand that, but the people that live here pay for the lake, the docks, and the fish in it and it isn't for just anyone to come here and use. We get into it and I tell him to leave. He refuses, calmly, and I tell him that our maintenance guy will be here in 10 minutes and he better find some tags in that time period or else he's getting dragged out. I get back to my house, call the maintenance guy, and I see the maintenance guy drive up to them from my window and presumably tell them to leave which they do. 

Am I the asshole here? On one hand, it is private property and I let them stay and finish the first day when I could have easily kicked them out. On the other hand, they weren't hurting anyone.

All of our friends and their children (anywhere from 4mo-3yr) came, including the titular friend. We had photos of each kid, each kid beside the cake, even some group shots. But we told our photographer to exclude our friend's son from specific photos. He still got lots of photos, but none with our daughter, he wasn't in the group shot, et cetera.

Why? Their son has a physical disability. Some sort of musculo-skeletal thing, we don't know the name and never asked. His face is perpetually grinning with his lips almost in a caricaturized way. Whether they plan to get corrective surgery I don't know. To put it blunt (and this might be point one where we're the assholes), he's unsightly. We didn't want him in photos we planned to hang around the house or put in our album because, to be frank, he ruins any photo he's in. 

His face is unfortunate and it's not his fault, but we paid for the photographer to take nice photos, stuff we could put up, and him being in any of them was impossible. He still got lots of photos, everyone did, and we forwarded them all to our friends, it's just in those specific photos we wanted to put up, we asked the photographer to frame him out of them or just exclude him entirely.

0,"AITA for refusing a pizza delivery 45 mins early? | So, I know this is not exactly a life or death situation, but I'm asking out of curiosity because I've had very different reactions from my friends and wanted to hear some more.

&#x200B;

There's a pizza place near my house (about 5 mins by walk) that also does deliveries through an app. I had ordered from them a couple of times, always on Sunday, and the delivery was late most of the times.   
I never made a fuss about that, since I know they're very busy in the weekend, but I thought I would start ordering the pizza for an earlier time to offset the expected ""lateness"".

&#x200B;

So one sunday I was having some friends over and, just to be sure, we ordered pizza for 8 pm. ( where I am from, this is considered an earl-ish dinner,  8:30-9pm is more common).

At 7:20 pm the doorbell rings...it's the delivery guy. I didn't know what to do so I just took the pizza and payed for it, but my friends were still at their own homes so the food was cold by the time they arrived.

The next week, same thing happened: the doorbell rang 45 minutes early. This time I was prepared, so I kindly told the delivery guy that I couldn't accept the delivery because the order I had placed was for a totally different time. The guy said to call the restaurant so they could make another pizza and sent it at the right time.  I felt bad doing it, but I went ahead and this time they delivered in it on time. They did seem pretty annoyed about it though.

0,"AITA For standing up at a concert while the people behind us keep asking us to sit down? | So this happened last week and I’m still bewildered by it. 

We went to the Elton John concert at Madison Square Garden. It was a pretty large concert, and we were able to get seats on the floor. We were in one of the back sections on the floor, which consisted of chairs set up on risers to create a sloped seating arrangement.

We’re sitting in our seats and the show starts. Everyone in front of us stands up and starts jamming with the music, and we join them. After the second song, the people sitting two rows behind us ask us to sit down. We turn around and see they’re an older couple, surrounded by a bunch of younger couples. 

I was trying to be respectful of their situation, so during one of Elton’s slower songs, we sit down, and politely ask the people in front of us to sit down as well. Enough rows sit down in front of us so that we can see the stage. 

Well, the song eventually ends and he starts playing Tiny Dancer, we stand back up along with all the people in front of us and next to us. The people behind us ask is to sit down, and we refuse. Eventually, the young couple in the row directly behind us, taps me on the back and asks if we could sit down because the people behind them keep asking. At this point, Philadelphia Freedom is on, and I flat out refuse. Everyone in front of us is standing and I want to stand up and jam. 

The older couple starts getting really angry and frustrated, now yelling at us to sit down. We ignore them. When the song finishes, Elton starts playing a slower song, so we sit down along with the people in front of us. The older couple, and the people sitting next to them start clapping sarcastically. I turned around and shot them a dirty look. 

So, for the rest of the show, we stood up for pretty much every upbeat song. Eventually, the young couple behind us apologized to us, saying they felt pressured by the people behind them.

It’s an Elton John concert. True, it’s not the kind of music that you’d have a pit to dance in and they provided chairs, but when pretty much everybody in the arena is standing up to jam, why shouldn’t we be allowed to?

She’s now gotten too old and asked us kids to take over the tradition. There are 4 of us so we just rotate. We’ve each hosted one holiday so far. This thanksgiving is my turn. 


We have never spent thanksgiving or Christmas Eve with my wife’s family. We’ve just never been as close to them plus they live all over the country. Well this year her mom and aunts decided to go to the Macy’s thanksgiving day parade. At first it was just a sister’s trip but then they decided to invite all their kids and grandkids to meet them up there. 


My wife really wants to go. She hasnt seen some of her aunts and cousins in years. Our daughter wants to go because it’s a “once in a lifetime event” (which i agree with). And I want to go.


As soon as we decided to go I called my older brother to see what we should do about thanksgiving because I can’t host this year. He said our oldest sister is going to be pissed and i have to tell her myself. He wished me luck.



So I call her and she is mad. She  says she’ll probably have to end up hosting even though she is up next for Christmas and I’m being inconsiderate of what our mom asked us to do. “Mom wouldn’t abandon thanksgiving to go to nyc” and went on about how sad mom will be that I’m doing this.


I offered to pay for them to rent a spot and have it catered but she said that takes away from the close knit family vibe. 


My brother said his wife might be up for it but he didn’t sound too happy about asking her. My other sister can’t do it because she’s renovating her house. 



I do feel bad for backing out of my turn but I tried to offer up solutions and I also offered to host the next holiday—which my oldest sister said no to because it’s her turn and she’s been planning for it all year. Next up is my brother so I said me and him could maybe just swap thanksgivings if his wife is up for it.

Today his training was to follow a server and learn what they do. He shadowed me for 20 minutes and I walked him through what I was doing. At one point, he was watching me enter information into our computer so I had my little notebook on the counter open. He laughed at how sloppy my notebook was so I explained that was writing in the margins because I only had like 10 blank pages left and I wanted to make sure I optimized each page.

Cut to the end of the day.

I was closing so it was only my general manager, the MIT, and I. My manager was on the floor and I was doing my final paperwork with the MIT.  He handed me my money and said I owed $4 to the restaurant.

Right after he tells me that, he reached into the apron I’m wearing, grabs my notebook, throws it in the thrash, and tells me to buy a new one.

A few things about this: this was a nice notebook and I am a female wearing an apron around my waist. Not to be dramatic but I was not okay with how close his hand was to my lady bits.

I immediately snapped and was loudly telling this MIT how rude and disrespectful that was. I took his $4 and threw it in the trash too.

1,"AITA for not wanting to pay for my stepkid's education despite paying for my own kid? | My husband and I have one daughter, age 7, and he has two older sons from a previous marriage (11 and 15). They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. 

So here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. 

Between our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say ""ok sure."" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. 

I want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver.

0,"WIBTA if I refuse to take in my sister's friend for her recovery. | So the situation is thus. One of my sister's close friends (Sarah, who I have only ever met twice) and I live in the same city. My sister and all of this woman's family live 4+ hours away.
  
I got a call this morning that Sarah has fallen and broken her leg and is going into surgery. Apparently she doesnt have any other friends or family in town. I volunteer to go and sit in the hospital with Sarah since she is alone.   
  
Now, my sister and Sarah are pressuring me to let her stay with me and my roomate (both single with jobs) for the 2-4 months of recovery when she cant put weight on her foot. We do have a spare room.  
 
I have been through this before when my ex wife fell and broke her leg eight years a go and I know how much of a hell it is going to be. I barely know this woman and feel like it is too much of a burden even though I feel sorry for her. For the first month at least its going to be cooking for her, helping her move to the bathroom, etc. Ideally I think she should go stay with her parents wherever they live.

We were unimpressed at the juices and decided to keep walking. I told my gf I was thirsty but since we were a 20/25 min away walk from our apartment, I just would wait. I also told her if she wanted to stop at another cafe on the walk home that sold juice I’d be down for that. A few blocks later, she stops and says she wants to stop at a minimart and grab a bottle of water. I argue it’s pointless because we’re pretty close to the house and why waste money and plastic.

0,"AITA for not wanting to wake up my spouse anymore? | My spouse (25M) and I (27F) have ongoing tension regarding his morning routine. He sets multiple alarms, but sleeps through all of them. I literally have to roll him out of bed to get him to wake up. Sometimes I get so angry about this childish situation that I don't wake him up, because I feel like I am on the absolute edge of screaming at him or throwing shit at the wall (I literally sit in a corner and use my Headspace app for deep breathing exercises when I feel like this, I don't want to become an abusive person). But when I don't wake him up, he gets upset at me for ""letting him sleep through his alarms."" 

He swears he doesn't hear his alarm, which I don't understand - the alarm is often Heavy Metal turned all the way up in volume. Mornings are when I am most productive, and having to hear an alarm go off a dozen times really ruins my mornings and makes me anxious. He usually plays video games until 1 or 3 am every night, and claims that he is a night owl, hates mornings, and that sleep ""is wasted time."" I've never nagged him about his gaming habit or that it is probably why he can't wake up in the morning, and I feel resentful that he doesn't even consider the bad energy that his alarms and inability to wake up bring me almost every morning. I can't believe that it took me five years of dealing with this shit to reach a breaking point.

0,"AITA for putting my twins in different schools? | My twins, boy/girl, are entering high school this year. The two of them are not particularly close; they have definitely grown apart the past couple years. They each have their own friend groups, their own activities, they take different classes, far from being attached at the hip like they were when they were little. I think the fact they went to the same middle school contributed to a lot of rifts with them. They were heavily influenced by friends who would pick on the other twin (this went both ways; son’s friends would pick on my daughter for being “stupid” since she has a learning disability, daughter’s friends would pick on my son for being a “loser” for playing video games). There were lots of times they would come home from school fighting because of what happened at school. Generally, though, they’d get along better outside of school.

This year, my husband and I looked into other high schools in the area to see if it was possible to put them in different schools. We actually found that one school has a really great special education program, much better than our default school, that would be perfect for my daughter, since, as I said, she has a learning disability. We put in the request to transfer her there, unsure of whether the request would even be accepted, and we talked to the twins about it. Neither of them seemed to think much of it. Now, though, we’ve gotten word that the request was accepted, and the twins are both upset. My daughter says it’s not fair she has to go to a different school, my son says that he wanted his sister in high school with him. Ever since we found out that the request was accepted, the twins have been teaming up and trying to guilt us for splitting them up. 

I honestly didn’t think splitting them up would make them so upset. They’ve already been split up these past couple years as they were always in different classes and friend groups. And they didn’t seem to mind when I first told them the idea. But now I’m wondering, should we be splitting them up? AITA for wanting to send them to different schools?",False,False
0,"AITA for hiding the fact that I switched careers from my parents? | To give some context, I’m a senior in college and was pre-med/neuroscience up until last year. I tried applying to med schools last cycle and didn’t get in. I decided to add a fifth year to add a psychology major in order to boost my gpa and apply again. I fell in love with psychology and decided to apply to a grad program in psych. It’s truly my passion and what makes me happy. I debated telling my parents but I decided against it because I have a mother that criticizes everything and makes me feel bad about everything I do. She’s never been nice about anything good I’ve done and I always end up feeling stupid after telling her about it. To counteract this, I hide all of my accomplishments from my parents so that I don’t feel bad about them. 

I wanted to avoid getting my feelings hurt because I even heard back from the program. I’m extremely sensitive and I know if she tried hard enough she could make me hate the program that I was super excited about applying to. Because of this, I couldn’t tell my father either out of fear that he would convince me to tell her or tell her himself.

A few days ago I found out that I got in and I was so happy! This is a passion of mine and I feel so content and comfortable. I decided to tell my parents that night and the first thing my mom said was that she would never be happy with it and neither would my father. She then proceeded to make fun the grad program and told me it was nothing to be excited about. Then she told me that I only switched because I didn’t think I would be able to make it through med school. My dad was quiet through all of this. Like I said earlier, I’m extremely sensitive and this completely crushed me. I started crying and then she called me names for crying and said that I was being overly dramatic. I went to my room and stayed there heartbroken and in tears for the rest of the night. My dad came to me and told me that I should have told them earlier and he would have supported me. But the issue was never him supporting me, it was that I always knew he wouldn’t defend me to my mom. I told him that I didn’t want to be discouraged before I even got in and he told me that it wouldn’t have happened (even though I knew it would...and it did). He really guilted me for not telling them but I was just protecting my heart and self-esteem. My mom has been going off about it for days and is standing firm in the belief that she wasn’t wrong for the things she said and that it was just parental concerns. I told her that it felt more like bullying than her having genuine concerns which led to her going on another tirade. My dad was still silent through all of this.

And to add, my parents aren’t paying for my school. It’s covered by financial aid. But I do live at home and I’m very dependent on them. So my question is, am I the asshole for switching my career goals without telling my parents?",False,False

I came out to make friends again and she nodded her head when I said ""who wants to be friends"". But nothing really changed the energy. I was honestly in good form. I asked her does she wants pancakes or is there anything I can do for. After that I started kissing her-just soft pecks, hoping it would make her feel better. After this nothing really changed again. She said she needs tissues (as she was crying) and told me that she would tell me what's wrong when I got her some tissues. I gave her a full roll of toilet paper and she said she doesn't want it. I said keep it because we have loads in the bathroom. She dismissed me. Anyways, while she was blowing her nose I was looking in the mirror moisturizing my face, whilst doing so I was looking at my posture and trying to fix it by tensing my glutes (sounds weird I know, but i'm really into body posture recently lol).

 I then went over to her and she started saying that I am so vain and that I don't care about her because she said that she would tell me what's wrong after I got her tissues. I did get distracted honestly, but that doesn't mean I don't care about her. I do care and told her while hugging her. She started calling my vain again whilst I tried to explain to her what I was doing, but she was still pissed. 

As she got more upset/angry/attacking/ I moved away from her and as I did, I saw two  wet snotty tissues on the bed, with the scary coronavirus I'm trying to promote healthy hygiene habits, so as I picked them up with thumb and finger I said something like ""babe you must put your tissues in the bin"". She turned around whilst in this state of emotional despair (crying, whining, you know that state) and raised her voice and said ""stop fucking lecturing me"". I wasn't mad at her, I just wanted to create good habits. 

Keep in mind while this was going on our room mates were basically outside our room. I hate people hearing us argue, it's embarrassing. Anytime we talked she would scream and let out her woeful cries louder. I don't think she cared that they could hear us, and she could see it made me feel uncomfortable. I think it's horrible of her to do that. I took out my laptop and put in earphones while she was still crying. AITA?

INFO: She was feeling down all day but told me that ""she felt sick"", she started crying before I went into the shower because she saw a photo of a man spreading his wife's ashes on reddit.

His dog was definitely presenting as a service dog; a harness with  SERVICE DOG on one side and DO NOT PET on the other as well as a ""hard handle"" attached to it. The dog itself was shaped rather like a cross between a German  Shepherd and a hound of some sort. The coloration was speckled for the most part. 

So, now on to the story.  I approached the man and asked in a soft, non-threatening voice what kind of a dog it was. He answered that it was a service dog.  ""No, what kind of a dog is it?"" ""It's for PTSD."" ""Oh, no no no. I don't care about any of that. I just wanted to know about the dog itself. It's very unusual looking.""

Not that we are separated it bothers me that my children don’t share a name with me. I grew up with a different last name than my mom and always hated it. So I asked my ex to agree to change our boys names and get them hyphenated to his AND mine but he very adamantly said no. So I decided I  would just change my surname to match his and the kids, even though we were never married. I don’t have any attachment to my last name as my bio dad and I have never been close so changing my name is no big deal to me. However when I mentioned it to my ex, he got angry and insisted that it would be very weird for me to do this.

We moved to this house six years ago and in the backyard, our neighbors to the south of us, an elderly couple had an overgrown maple tree, wisteria, and other unidentifiable vines which would grow over our property. It starts about waist-high and goes up to about three stories high.  We live in a one-story house so two or three times a year, I have to get on my roof just to clear it.  It was backbreaking work and took all day. They have never offered to hire someone to clean it up and since they are elderly, I just let it go and trimmed STRAIGHT up so that it did not affect the growth on their side of the fence.

Last year, they finally ripped everything out because they put in a pool.  I do have one vine on my side of the fence which extends into their property. I had told the male neighbor that I will be trimming that back so that it does not hang over their pool, dropping leaves and flowers.  He was cool with that but a couple days later his wife came over and asked me to trim it in a certain decorative way.

I declined, stating that I am not a professional and I would be happy to trim any growth that hangs over their side of the yard but I would not take requests since I am merely clearing back greenery and not doing it for decorative reasons.

0,"AITA for texting the group chat about a used tampon sitting out in our bathroom? | I currently live in a house with 3 other roommates. All of us are in college. The 3 girls I live with are fucking gross, to put it lightly. They are all best friends as well, so I think they kind of enable each other. They do not clean up after themselves and they completely neglect things like dishes, cleaning up after parties, etc. It's only for the semester that I live here, thank the lord.

Recently, I was in the shower and I notice a used tampon on the side of the shower. It's totally bloody and engorged from the shower water, and the blood is dripping down into the shower. Gross.

So, after getting out of the shower I realize no one is home. I thought a lot about how I want to address it, and I decided to text this exactly in the house group chat: ""Hi, someone left something in the shower. They should clean it up as soon as possible.""

Fast forward to later, people had presumably come home and whoever it was took care of it. 

The next day, one of the girls asked to talk to me. She basically told me that all 3 of them had separately looked in the shower trying to figure out if it was them that 'left something,' and that, through process of elimination, it was figured out who the culprit was. She kind of condescendingly told me that she understands where I was coming from but that I really embarrassed the girl that did it (even though I still don't know who did it, I suppose it's now a secret between them). In return, I told her that my intention was not to embarrass anyone, that it was unsanitary, and if she was suggesting I clean it up instead. She told me she's not quite suggesting that but that I really shouldn't have addressed everyone about it.

I didn't apologize and told her that I did what I thought was appropriate. However, I'm now wondering if I was in the wrong for how I handled it. I asked my mother and she said I should have just cleaned it up, but my mom has relatively poor judgment and will avoid confrontation at all costs.

0,"WIBTA for asking/insisting that my flatmate start using toilet paper? | So I (24F) live with a 30F. I've been in this flat a couple of years and have had a couple of flatmates move in and out, and when the last one moved out I put out a post on FB looking for flatmates. Had never met this woman (let's call her S), but she seemed nice, friendly, & reliable, so everything was arranged and she moved in.
We get along fine. There are small household-y pet peeves, but all stuff that can be easily dealt with and addressed given good communication.
Then, something very strange happened. I notice that for the thirdish time, she had left an empty roll of TP in the bathroom. I chalked it up to her being forgetful. So, in a tactful way, I ask her, ""Hey S, just a quick favour, could you change the TP roll out when it's done?""

Without skipping a beat, she says, ""I don't use toilet paper.""

I am very confused and don't know where to begin. ""You... don't use toilet paper? What?""

She says something along the lines of, ""I just don't use toilet paper.""

In my surprise I do not know how to follow up without seeming pushy or prying, so I don't. But in my head, I'm like, a) WTF do you use? and b) where did all the fucking TP go?!

I question my sanity a little, and move on. I take her at her word, and continue to pay for all the TP in the house. Life goes on. Then, later, I finally ask her what she means when she says she doesn't use TP. She just says she uses her hands, water and soap. OK, I suppose?! In my head I'm like that seems like... it could only be hygienic if you're really good about it, so I will just assume that you are? And I will not pass judgment or tell you how to live?

Later, I notice that the TP runs out super quickly (especially if only one person uses it), so I ask her, a little confused and frustrated, ""how much TP do you use?"" (maybe she uses it for other stuff?), and her response, verbatim, is ""I use it sparingly.""

In my head, I'm like, 1) if you are using TP at the rate I am deducing then you need to be paying for it! 2) Am I really okay with her not using TP and potentially spreading all her fecal and urine particles all over the house?!
Lately, the coronavirus has been a really big deal in the SE Asian city that I live in, which has 1) caused TP shortages, and 2) made personal hygiene all the more important. I've started to keep my TP in my bedroom and bring it to the bathroom when I use it.

You know how you can hear the faucet going in the bathroom when someone uses it? Whenever she 'goes', the faucet only turns on for a couple of seconds, definitely not long enough to wash her hands thoroughly.
I'm so confused. I'm becoming increasingly less comfortable with her toilet 'habits' (if they really are her habits, I mean I don't fucking know what goes on in there!), and want to bring it up with her. But at the same time I don't want to tell her how to live! WIBTA for bringing it up and insisting that she start using toilet paper (that she should pay for?)?",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I (24f) reported my (ex) Therapist for unethical behavior? | Over the past few years, I was really struggling with my mental health. I was unmotivated, depressed, extremely anxious, and having bursts of anger. 
So a few months ago, I decided it was finally time to seek outside help. Which brings me to the therapist.

(I have since been diagnosed with ADHD and a mood disorder- not by the therapist)

At the end of my first session with the therapist, I was bothered when they forced me to hug them at the end and said “you’ll get used to it”. I’m not comfortable with physical touch.

I kept going to the sessions bc 1. I wanted to give them a chance and 2. I was finally getting help and did not want to deny myself an opportunity to feel better.

So 2 months go by and I consistently go to my weekly session. Eventually my sessions were only doing the biofeedback, even though I wanted and needed talk therapy. 
They also arrived 15 minutes late to a session (without any notification) AND during my last few sessions, they  spent 10-15 minutes of my time complaining about their own problems.
My copay was $45 per session, so I did not appreciate that. (2months cost me $360)

Here’s the present problem:
I recently started school, and due to requirements, had to change my session time/day.
The last time I saw them (~3 weeks ago) I told them I would like to change days and they responded along the lines of “ I am sure I have another availability, I’ll get back to you on that”. 
A few days later, I text them to see if they looked at the schedule—- no response

The next week I got the confirmation text for the appointment on Tuesday, I immediately texted them to remind them I can’t make it and that I’d still like to find another session time that works. —— no response.

The same thing happened last week, automated call and my text response, asking for their available times—- NO RESPONSE

This week I got no text reminder, which seems like they removed me from their schedule.I text them 1 final time saying I wanted to keep seeing them and to please let me know what availability they have. —— no freaking response

I have still yet to hear from them. 
No discharge summary or reason.
Luckily, I have been on some medicine that has really helped me (thanks to an NP, not the therapist). But I have to be honest, this hurts. Guess you could say I was ghosted by my therapist. 

I really don’t like the idea of putting  someone’s job or livelihood in jeopardy. But I also don’t want anyone else to experience this, especially if they are emotionally or mentally vulnerable.

I also feel like I spent almost $400 for mental health services, that did nothing for me. Again, I am 24 and in school, so budgeting that money for therapy was difficult, but at the time I thought it was a necessary expense. Now I need to find a new provider, which can take months. 

Important notes: 
- I work in providing healthcare services (all I’m comfortable saying), so I am familiar with ethic guidelines and appropriate provider-to-client relationships.

1,"AITA for being suspicious of my boyfriend's best friend? | I'm 22F, just to get that basic info out of the way.

My boyfriend (23) has this one male friend ""Matt"" (23) he seems unusually close to. They've known each other since kindergarten so maybe that'd explain the fact that they're so attached to one another.

However... And excuse me if I'm being offensive, but literally everyone who meets Matt is convinced he's gay. When I first met him, I was almost sure of it. I went to art school, something like 90% of my male friends were gay so I'd think I have a pretty good gaydar. My best (gay) friend even said ""yup, that guy likes dick"" as soon as he saw Matt.

Matt laughs that stuff off though, as does my boyfriend. Normally I'd take his word for it, but his behavior says otherwise. I think Matt has a thing for my boyfriend.

For example... Last year, Matt had a girlfriend of 5 months. They broke up specifically because Matt wanted to go vacationing *only* with my boyfriend, that is his best friend, not his girlfriend. And that's something they regularly do together: take trips completely alone, without other friends or partners.

It also seems like Matt feels entitled to spending more time with my boyfriend than anyone else. He easily gets jealous if my boyfriend cancels their plans to hang out with me and my friends.

To top it all off, my boyfriend did admit Matt once tried to make out with him, then kiss his neck back in college. They were drunk though, and my boyfriend doesn't think much of it. I'm convinced otherwise, however.

So AITA for distrusting this friendship and wanting my boyfriend to put more distance between Matt and himself? For his own good, because I think he's being too gullible due to their closeness.",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I (F25) only join Christmas dinner with my mother if there will be no alcohol? | I know it sounds bad, but I just really don't want my mom to drink any alcohol when I'm around. She isn't very good in holding her liquor.

As my parents are divorced and both me and my brother (M22) have moved out, we don't always celebrate Christmas with our mother. This year, we and our partners will all go to her place and celebrate with her and her boyfriend.

My biggest concern is that she will get drunk with Christmas and will be mean and/or agressive.

During the divorce with my dad, she once got so drunk, she threw my little brother and I (then 14) out of the house. My father picked us up and we stayed with him over the weekend. It really shook me. I don't feel we ever got a real apology for her drunk behaviour.A few years later, she even managed to get drunk at a New Years Eve party at a friends' place (me and my brother were there too) and be brought to bed even before it was midnight.

Every time we try to talk to her about her behaviour after a couple of drinks, she feels its nog our place. Or says we are overreacting. Often she just gets annoying and laughs at her own terrible (and sometimes hurtful) jokes.But I feel I just don't trust her. As normal talking does not help, would making demands make a difference?

It feels unkind to plain out say that I don't want her to drink when I'm around. So I feel like us all not drinking would be a better way. Or is there another way to fix this?",False,False
1,"AITA for showing concern about my girlfriend’s breast implant scars? | Hey. I (19M) have been with my girlfriend (18F) for half a year now. We met in college. She said she has wanted a breast augmentation for years. I didn’t judge whether she needed one or not. I trusted her to make the right decision for herself. She didn’t turn 18 until last November so she couldn’t get the procedure done until winter break. I’m glad she didn’t go too big. They look fine, but there are very long and noticeable horizontal scars on the underside of her breasts. I’m sure that’s normal and will fade eventually. 


However, before we parted ways in March to spend the isolation with our respective families, her scars still looked very noticeable. I’m not sure they even started to fade from the handful of times she let me see her naked. She wouldn’t let me get too close to them. I’m guessing her shortage of breast tissue coupled with the implants stretched her skin too thin, but still I need them to heal quicker so she wouldn’t be so protective of her breasts, even to me. She said she is diligent though about applying aloe vera gel and petroleum jelly to the scars to help heal them more efficiently. 


I haven’t asked her about the scars since we parted ways until yesterday. We were video calling and the thought of her scars popped up. I told her I missed her body (I really do) and to show me her breasts. She showed me and I noticed that her scars are still so noticeable even with the poor resolution. I asked her when those scars are expected to become less noticeable. She said perhaps a few more months. I said that I hope they’re faint by the time we meet again. I’m guessing that’s sometime in the summer but who knows. She told me to not give her any more stress. I don’t know what she means by that. Our lives are pretty chill right now and our families are all healthy. 


I told her that I’m not trying to stress her out, but that her scars should have healed a bit quicker than they have by now, considering that many of my large open wounds from my childhood healed much more quickly from what I can remember. She told me that everyone heals differently and to stop being so insensitive. I apologized and told her to not forget to apply her gels. She seemed angered by what I said. She told me to stop being so irritating. I guess she didn’t want to talk about her scars so I started talking about something else. However, I still felt her residual anger present in the remainder of our conversation. I’ll let her calm down on her own because what else can I do?",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my dad that I can do whatever I want to with my hair? | So...like, in my mind I don't think I'm an asshole but my family is treating me like I have disowned my father for this so here goes: 

Around 2017, I cut all of my hair off. All of it. I stopped getting relaxers and let my hair go natural because I really wanted to try it, and I LOVE it. I have kept my hair short and proper since, and I feel a lot more freer with my hair in it's natural, healthy state. 

My father, on the other hand, HATES it. Like, despises it. Everytime he has seen me, for like the past year or so, he has to comment on my hair. I've always been nice about it, laughed off his jokes about it, and kind of shrugged them off, but I'm going to be honest, it's started to piss me off. 

Today, I walked into the room where he was, and the first thing he says to me is: ""When are you going to let your hair grow out and get a relaxer?"" Y'all, I'm on my period and I'm cramping so I just let him have it. I told him that I have agency over my own body and that I like the style so I'm not changing it. He looked at me and laughed, then mocked me like a three year old. He was like ""You don't have to be rude,"" and I'm like, ""I'm not being rude, I just don't like you talking about my body and my hair choices. I don't tell you what to do with your hair."" He looked over at my mom and was like ""Why is she so rude?"" and she told me that ""I wasn't being nice"" and I just...I don't know what to think?

0,"WIBTA if I enter my daughter's life against the wishes of her mother? | Please read before commenting there's quite a bit to unpack here.

Years ago, in my late 20s, I decided I wanted to have a kid. Problem is my relationships never lasted long for a variety of reasons. I had honestly given up on the traditional ""nuclear family"" dream and decided to try co-parenting with a like-minded single woman. 

So I did just that, and eventually got in touch with a woman called Jessica (name changed) after finding each other online. We set out some ground rules about how we would co-parent, met a few times in person, etc and eventually decided to go ahead with it. After two attempts of using a home donor-kit we were successful and she was pregnant.

At this point I'm over the moon and already planning the future in my mind. About a month in she called me and told me she'd had a miscarriage. Made me feel like absolute shit, because in my mind I'd already bonded with my would-be child, but I moved on with my life. Never spoke with Jessica again after that call. I knew her family would be comforting her, and even though I wanted to try again eventually, I thought it would be deeply inappropriate to ask her. So I decided to let her reach out to me if she wished. She didn't.

About a year later I try again, this time with a pleasant lesbian couple that also agreed with me as far as co-parenting and so on. We had twin boys and they're the light of my life - just turned 8 years old. 

So I hadn't spoken too Jessica for roughly 10 years at this point until I run into her at the supermarket with a young girl that's presumably her daughter. I immediately recognize she looks a bit older than my twin boys and alarm bells start going off in my head. Jessica didn't have a daughter when I knew her so, if she is older than my boys, she's probably mine.

I calmly confronted her when the girl was out of earshot and she admits she's my daughter. She didn't want to co-parent and lied about having a miscarriage, she wanted to be a single mother, etc. She starts begging me not to say anything to her daughter and I agree, provided she adds me on facebook (then and there) so I could at least see pictures of my daughter.

Well, that's what I said anyway, I actually wanted to have her add me on Facebook so I had her current contact details and she couldn't ghost me.

So with all that unpacked, WIBTA if I tried to reach out to my daughter against her mother's wishes? The reason I think I might be the asshole is it would probably be very disruptive to her family life. Maybe it's better for my daughter that I just stay out?

I only saw her for a few brief moments, but she seems so sweet. Genuinely breaks my heart not being there to watch her grow up.",False,False
0,"AITA for not telling my grandfather about my moms impending death? | So I know it sounds bad, but my dad and I both feel we’re in the right for this. 

Here’s the timeline:
In October of 2019 my mom was unexpectedly diagnosed with stage 4 terminal colon cancer. We started chemo, but she had numerous complications which has landed her being in hospice since February. My grandfather has come up and seen my mom at least 4 times since then. And she got better for a couple weeks but now she is declining rapidly.

Backstory as to why we don’t want grandfather here. When my mom was in high school he cheated on and divorced my grandma and chose to have custody of only my moms little sister because she was the golden child in his eyes because she was into girly things and my mom was a tomboy. 

Then once my mom went to college my grandfather was supposed to help support her but decided to buy himself a sports car and a yacht with her college education fund. My mom starved for a semester and lost 30lbs because of that. He also only helped fund my aunts wedding and didn’t give a cent to my mom and dad. He also didn’t come to my high school graduation ceremony because he deemed it unnecessary because he already went to my older sisters. My grandfather also has a habit of making everything about him. Like when my mom got diagnosed it wasn’t “I’m so sorry  (my mom’s name)” but instead he acted like his life was over because of losing his daughter who he didn’t even have much of a relationship with. He also told me and my sister that our grief is nothing compared to what he’s feeling because my mom is his daughter. I understand that he’s allowed to be sad but grief isn’t a competition. My mom doesn’t want him here. She’s told us numerous times she wants nothing to do with him.

So my dad and I haven’t decided to tell him that my mom is days away from death. All of my family on my moms side, her sister, and her mom are ok with it, I just know it’s going to cause a major problem when we tell my grandfather she passed away without letting him come up and see her again. 

So AITA for not wanting him to see her before she dies because of what he’s put her through?

0,"AITA for firing my sister-in-law? | I started a business in Jan 2018 & hired my SIL as an independent contractor. We provide flat rate admin support for local realtors. I acquire 100% of all client relationships & divide them between the team to work with.

May 2018, I receive a complaint from a client about SIL's attitude. I pull SIL aside to have a private discussion about it, coach her, & express that it should not happen again.

Aug. 2018, 2nd complaint on her attitude/tone of voice. Again I pull her aside to coach, say this is inappropriate, etc. 

Nov. 2018, another client has major issues with SIL & received complaints from her own vendors & clients. Losing this client cost me \~$20k in revenue. Final warning is issued to SIL.

Dec 2018, I plan a team retreat to celebrate our 1st year. The plan is to rent a mountain cabin for a long weekend, work on business goals, then invite partners & party for the rest of the trip.

SIL is poly & her primary is married to someone else. Partner was not willing to drive 2hrs to see SIL for a partial weekend.

First SIL asks if her partner AND his wife can come up for the WHOLE weekend, & they 3 take the king sized bed. This is a company paid event & we’re there to build team culture first. 1 partner per person, & as company owner, I was planning to take the master. Sorry not sorry.

SIL went off on a text rampage saying I was not being fair & that I was doing this intentionally because I don’t approve of her poly lifestyle. She called me her “coworker,” said I never tried to help or coach her, & threatened her job.

I finally very gently let her go via email so I would have written documentation. I listed 5 reasons why I was letting her go, closing with “I will always love you, you will always be my SIL, but our working relationship ends now.”

She responded with ""I want no contact” & blocked me across all social media.

The next day I received a very short apology email saying she was sorry for wanting no contact & that the ball is now in MY court to fix our relationship.

Before I could decide how to respond, I got calls from my clients, asking if SIL had my blessing for her “new venture”. She decided to start her own business doing the exact same thing & was soliciting every client I provided. I did not have her sign a non-solicit, so I had no legal grounds. It felt like her apology was completely insincere given her actions, so I never responded to her email. She closed up shop on her business 60 days later & we have not spoken. 

Fast forward to now. Husband & I decided not to see family for Xmas because of the weirdness with SIL. Last time I was around her, she acted as though I didn't exist while exuding this icy vibe the whole extended family could feel. It was very uncomfortable.

Now the whole family is upset because we said we didn’t want to visit until things changed with SIL. SIL blew up again saying the ball has been in my court since day 1 & I ended our relationship.

0,"AITA for suggesting to my pregnant fiancée that I sleep on the couch because she's uncomfortable in bed? | Hello,

Backstory: I just moved to my fiancée's home country after having a long distance relationship with her for sometime. She's now 11 weeks pregnant and she's experiencing severe hyperemesis (incredibly bad morning sickness - more like all day sickness).

&#x200B;

I bought her a pregnancy pillow (one which can wrap around her entire body) recently, and she's been using it in bed. It's a queen sized bed, but with the pillow too, there's not a lot of room for me now, so I'm sleeping as far up against the wall on my side of the bed.

&#x200B;

Today she's told me that she didn't sleep well last night because she's having to get up around 4 times a night to pee (as a result of the fluids she's being administered to help with dehydration). She told me that once she did get back into bed, I was breathing in her general direction, and it wasn't very pleasant - which is fair enough, but I'm having trouble sleeping facing the wall, my arm now has a bad ache every time I am positioned that way. She also cannot face the other way as a result of having the line for her fluids in her arm.

&#x200B;

Now, I wanted to figure out how we are going to solve this - as the big thing here is that we need to re-arrange her room as a few pieces of furniture need to move around to make sure we both have access to a side of the bed, and also for room in the future for a crib. In lieu of that not happening instantaneously (need help from her brothers to shift the furniture), I suggested that I sleep in the front room until it comes time to rearrange the bedroom.

&#x200B;

She took this to mean that I didn't want to sleep next to her in bed anymore, which is entirely untrue - and I even made that clear, but she then says that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill out of the whole situation.

0,"AITA for accidentally letting my cat out at night | Last night I accidentally let my 15 year old deaf cat outside and couldn't find her to get her back inside. In the morning I couldn't find her anywhere. 

A neighbour told me that she saw a cat get taken away in a council car in a cage early this morning, I eventually find where she is being held which was 40 minutes away, and drive to get her back + a $300 fine for her being out of the house overnight.

I find out my neighbour caught her with a cage with food in it. They set the trap because a cat has been scratching/damaging their outdoor furniture. I never let my cat out overnight ever so it wasn't my cat that has been doing the damage.

I feel like they could at least ask their neighbours to keep their cats in before putting out a cat trap and they didn't care at all that they had caught my cat in a cage overnight when it's not the one damaging their furniture. But I could be misjudging this totally because I'm annoyed.

0,"WIBTA for inviting my SIL and her family up for the holidays but not my FIL and step-MIL? | A little background: my mother-in-law passed away just over 2 years ago. I was extremely lucky in that I had a wonderful relationship with her. I loved her very much, she loved me, and I miss her terribly. It was a very difficult time for my husband and sister-in-law, they were a very close family, so it's something they are still dealing with. 

My father-in-law got remarried very quickly, and he has now been married to his new wife for a year. She is...okay. She's nice enough, tries to be friendly with all of us, but she has a personality that just doesn't mesh well, and she has a habit of stepping on toes. She has tried way too hard to step into a ""mother"" role to my husband and SIL, and ""grandmother"" role to my SIL's kids, while they are still grieving the loss of their mom, so it has rubbed everyone the wrong way. There are a lot of other little things, like moving into their childhood home and getting rid of all photos of their mom without offering them to the kids, that have put a strain on that relationship. 

The other element at play here is that ever since he got remarried, my FIL has been very disengaged from our lives when he was once super involved. He doesn't call, doesn't make much effort to see his grandkids, and spends much more time with his new wife's kids and her grandkids. For the record, I don't think step-MIL is actively trying to push FIL to spend less time with us, it just seems that she dictates how they spend their time and he just goes along with it, so this is on him. This has been especially difficult on my SIL, who is tremendously hurt at how little her dad seems to care about her kids.

This all leads me to the holidays. The holidays have been very tough since my MIL passed away. Especially since step-MIL takes them VERY seriously. She's quite religious (Christian) while my husband, SIL, and I are all agnostic Jews. SIL's husband is agnostic as well. 

My husband and I are planning to spend the holidays out of state with my family this year. My mom suggested inviting my SIL and her family to join us, since she is aware of the circumstances and how difficult it would be for SIL to spend the holidays with step-MIL, especially without my husband and I there. I think it's a great idea, but WIBTA for not inviting my FIL and step-MIL? Step-MIL's kids and grandkids will be with her ex-husband this year, so part of me feels bad about potentially making them spend the holidays without anyone, but I've seen how difficult these past 2 years have been for my SIL and I want to help give her a fun, stress-free holiday.

0,"AITA for asking my friend not to bring a date to my party? | This happened about a month ago, but some of my friends think I was the asshole here and I’d like an objective view. 

I decided to throw a joint birthday party for my brother/end of finals week party in my apartment. He and I go to the same college, are in the same major, and are involved in the same clubs, so we have a lot of overlap in our friend groups. Since the group of people was going to be relatively small (seeing as my brother really only wanted to invite one or two people I wouldn’t have invited), I offered to make brunch and mimosas for everyone. 

About a week before the party, one of my friends texted me and said something along the lines of “I invited a guy from Tinder, remember to make extra food for him!” I was kind of taken aback, since I hadn’t realized she was seeing someone. I asked her about him, and found out that this was going to be the first time she’d be meeting him. I was uncomfortable with that, and texted her “I wish you had asked me before you invited him - I’m not really comfortable with this, and I’d rather you didn’t bring him.” 

My friend lost it, and told me I was being ridiculous. She left the group chat for the party, ended up not coming to the party at all, and texted another friend of mine that I was being unfair. 

My other friends are split on this - some of them think I was in the right and that my friend was being rude and childish about the whole thing, and some of the think I was in the wrong and that it wouldn’t have been an issue for her to have a date in an apartment full of people.

About 4 weeks ago we found out that my girlfriend is pregnant which was unplanned and did not happen due to stupidity but through a medical mistake. we both agreed on an abortion. We have visited a specific clinic for a check up where they told us they can't do the procedure at the moment due to her having an low iron level and anemia so we got send away with the instruction to get iron pills and come back later. Soon after that the nausea related to pregnancy hit my girlfriend very hard. She already has been mentally through a lot and takes antidepressants to help her so soon the whole thing started being really tough not only physically but also mentally for her and she kept on saying that she can't bear this much [longer.So](https://longer.So) at one point she said that she will get an iron infusion to get her iron level up fast because she could not keep the iron pills down and we got an appointment for the clinic right after that to get the procedure. We went to her home country to see her GP who drew her blood and said that her iron level is perfectly fine. With this knowledge we went to our appointment which she had to attend by her self due to the health crisis. after the appointment she told me they didn't do anything and just tested her iron level and than said it was way to low and they would not do it.She started crying after that and while we drove back she did not talk and seemed to be in her own headspace.

0,"AITA if I tell my parents they’re the reason my brother acts so entitled. | TL;DR at the bottom

So for background:
I (18F) and my brother (16M) are 18 months apart in age as a result I have no memories were he isn’t present, some of my earliest are of him throwing huge tantrums in public places like shops, parks, beaches over the smallest things and not being punished but seemingly rewarded.

The clearest one I remember is when we were at a fair at a beach in the middle of summer when I was 8 and my brother was a few months of 7, it was some time in the afternoon we walked passed several booths selling BB guns (realistic looking ones not the obviously fake ones). We were trying to find the food booth to get drinks and a snake, my brother saw the BB guns and immediately declared “I want that” and pointed to the BB that looked like a rifle.

Mums first response was no as was dads, this caused my brother to not only cry but to scream that the top of his lungs in the middle of the street while declaring that our parents are cruel, nasty, selfish, cheap and that he would be better of living with strangers than our parents because then the people he lived with would care about him and love him. My parents stood there for about 5 maybe 10 minutes while this was happening and then my mum chucked her purse at my dad and told him to go buy the BB my brother had pointed at, it was over £40 (I don’t remember the exact price he broke it the same week). We then had to go home immediately and my parents were angry the rest of the day and the rest of the week.

Present:
My brother now expects everything to be done for him, even the simplest things like getting a drink or cleaning his room and if it isn’t done the exact minute he asks he will shout and bang his things on the floor before yelling that no one loves him or respects him. He demands money from our parents constantly for stuff on his xbox, sometimes £40 to £60 pounds twice a week and then throws a fit when he’s told we can’t afford it, he will then proceed to demand my parents put of paying a bill or demand they take out a loan to give him the money. He truly believes that what he wants should come before us being able to keep a roof over our heads.

My parents are seriously worried about his entitled behaviour and how he doesn’t seem able to grasp the concept of working for money or paying bills to live somewhere. They’re now wondering how he could have grown up to behave like this and don’t seem able to see that it could be there fault.

0,"AITA for letting my nephew stay at my place? | My (23F) nephew (14M) just came out to my sister and BIL. I’m very close with my family since it’s very small, but I didn’t see this coming either. 

My sister and i grew up in a very religious home. She still goes to church and i stopped going when i was 12. So I’m not very religious. She’s never been homophobic, but her husband is a different story. She grew up with him because they met in church. but yes, he does have a different opinion than my sister. So my nephew came out to them and his dad wasn’t so understanding.

It ended up in an argument with all of them, i don’t know the full details, but his dad did say some hateful things. I don’t have kids or anyone to take care of so i’ve always been close to my nephews and nieces. My nephew called me up and asked if i could pick him up. I live 3 hours away, i didn’t know if i would be able to go, but he was crying and overall sounded like he was hurt. It was 8 pm at that point, but i just drove. I tried calling my sister before i went, but she didn’t pick up. And my nephew refused to pass her the phone. Once i reached my sisters house, i talked to her for a bit and she decided that it was best for my nephew to stay with me for the weekend. She told me her husband left soon after the argument was finished. 

I didn’t hear from them until this morning. He’s threatening to call the police on me, but i’m not really concerned about that. (my sister won’t let him) The thing that annoyed me was he claimed that i was showing him that you could run away from your issues. He also said that he better be back by sunday morning for church and i refused. I don’t care about my BIL’s feelings so i guess that’s what makes me an asshole (?).

I've been very careful to not tell my wife how to do things or how I did them in the past because she's excited to have the  experience of a baby and she's expressed things like ""you've done this before. This is my only chance to have a baby."" (I got the snipsnip shortly after he was born). Basically I don't want to Dadsplain parenting. 

This has led to things that I personally think are potentially problematic (ie she won't do cry it out even though the doc said it's time) BUT I'm happy to let her have her way so long as lil dude is healthy and safe. (Yes we've talked about it and she knows where I stand on it. That's not what I'm worried about being an asshole about)

DUUUUUUUUUDE. I KNOOOOOOOOOOW.


And it's been like that since the beginning. ""you've got to support his head."" "" You swaddle him too tight"" ( I didnt. That shit's supposed to make then immobile).

This year, I bought everyone whisky, except for one of my coworkers. Instead of whisky, I bought him some protein powder. There is a bit of a story behind this, as last year I bought everyone alcohol, which is something of a tradition in the office. He did not take any of this home and it is still sitting in his desk a year later. I wanted to get him something this year that he would actually use instead of something that would just collect dust. He goes to the gym every day at lunch and has a protein shake when he gets back. I thought that the best present is something that I know he uses every day. So, I gave him the protein powder. He took one look at it and said that he couldnt use that, its creatine and handed it back to me. I was at a loss for words and just took it back.

I was able to get the system, but ultimately, I did not like the iphone and wanted to go back to the android. This isn't a whole android vs. iphone thing, I don't really care about that debate. I understand why people like the iphone. The android suits me better. It was within the 2 week period so it shouldn't be an issue. 

I got to the store and had a worker help me. I told him that I wanted to trade this phone in for an android and maybe go up the one I initially had (I had a 9, wanted to do a 10 instead). For some reason, this worker could not fathom why I would want to  trade an iphone in for an android. He kept going on and on about how great his iphone is and I just told him that I prefer the android and just wanted to get one already. This went on for a while and I was getting pissed that he kept fighting me on this for some reason.  It got to a point where another worker came over and asked if everything was okay. I kind of snapped and said that I just wanted to get an android, trade this phone in, and leave. The other worker apologized and took over and everything was settled within 30 mins or so. 

So a couple days ago, I went back into the store to clear up a billing issue and get a new case when I got the same second worker that helped me out in the end. We talked for a bit and I found out they ended up letting the other worker go. Turns out the issue with me was the last straw. I couldn't believe it.

1,"AITA for refusing to buy a dishwasher when my partner say it’ll make life easier? | I hand wash my dishes, it doesn’t bother me, never has (I don’t love it either). I don’t do leaving dishes in the sink until later. The exception is dishes are left in the sink whilst I’m eating food that I want to preserve its prepared temperature. I’ll do this even after breakfast before work.

My partner, isn’t like this. She leaves dishes in the sink to soak and deal with them hours or a day later. She’ll put a used mug or plate in the sink to soak and take out a fresh one for a new coffee or snack. This leads to the sink filling up and stuff getting caked on cookware. Most of the time I end up doing these dishes. Partner uses this as an example why we need a dishwasher because it’s difficult to clean.

I guess I nag about this, but to me I see it as a small effort. Partner disagrees and hates doing dishes, to the point she’s demanding we buy a dishwasher because it would “make life so much easier”. I refuse as it’s not that big of an effort. I’ll concede it could make life easier, but not at that cost.

My stance is I’m not agreeing to spend our joint money on this or my personal money. I just don’t see the value it brings compared to its cost (price, maintenance, etc.). Partner is livid, but I’m standing firm.

0,"AITA for not employing someone based on their SO? | Using a throwaway for reasons. 

I (female) own a small-ish business (8 staff) with other 2 partners in a niche field. We're recruiting for a new senior staff member and have been for quite some time, it's a difficult post to fill.


We've interviewed someone who is perfect for the job, I've actually worked with him before and he's great, ideal for the job and our future plans. He would bring skills and knowledge to our business that would be extremely beneficial. However, I have since discovered that he is engaged to a very unsavoury lady (how or why, baffles me).


Based on this, I dont want to hire him.


She has actually physically attacked me in the past with a bottle (at random), to the point I was actually pressing charges against her (which were eventually dropped by myself), it affected me so much that I didn't want to go out in my home town for several months. Another friend of mine has had a similar experience with her too so it's not an isolated event. She's violent and unpredictable. I still have a scar on the back of my head from the attack.


The culture of our company involves partners quite regularly for lunches, dinners, weekend retreats etc so avoiding her would be impossible and quite frankly I dont want anything to do with this person, ever. 


Ultimately, I'm responsible for day to day management and the final decision is my call, but my partners feel I'm being unreasonable and I should let bygones be bygones for the sake of the business, but I'm threatened and intimidated by this individual and being the co owner of this business, I dont think I should put myself in that situation.

My roommate texted my girlfriend today and TOLD her that they were having a date night with their ladies and that we couldn't utilize the entire lower level of our apartment because they planned a date. I would have been fine if it was ASKED of us, but they just basically said, hey, you cant be here during this time tonight. To make matters worse, I'm going in for surgery tomorrow morning, and my last meal needs to be before 11 pm, which makes it difficult, seeing as their dates usually go into 1 in the morning or later. They made dinner and planned on basically telling us to fuck off until morning, regardless of the situation. 

Not only that, but we were getting snacks on our way up to our bedroom, where we are currently in time out, I was asked in what seemed to be the rudest way possible when I was going upstairs.

0,"AITA for refusing to cook the kind of food my husband wants? | So let me preface this by saying that I was overweight when I met my husband. Also, before I started working from home, I (F28) didn’t really care about how healthy our meals were. I cooked comfort food most of the time with little thought regarding calories and my husband (M41) loved everything I made. I think it’s part of the reason he fell for me to be honest. Since I started working from home I now have an extra two hours a day (as I’m no longer commuting) and have used it to start exercising. 

My family has a history of high blood pressure and it hit home for me just recently that it’s time to get in shape. My husband was supportive at first but as I’ve started to really lose weight he’s become less so. He’s always bringing home junk food, which would be fine if he wanted it just for himself, but he tries to pressure me into eating it as well.

My husband is a mailman and walks 15 miles a day so he’s in better shape than I am. His dinners used to consist of two or three helpings of whatever unhealthy food I made that day. Lately I’ve been making healthier choices when it comes to our food. My husband can’t cook to save his life and the grocery shopping and all cooking is done by me. When I say healthier choices I don’t mean tofu and kale, I mean that I’ve started cooking our favorite foods but with healthier alternatives, like using 1% milk instead of heavy cream and adding veggies.

Since I’ve started doing this my husband has doubled his efforts in trying to get me to stop working on my health. He still has his normal two to three helpings so the food can’t taste that bad. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even share with him anymore if I reached a new goal because he gets all surly.

It all came to a head last night when I made a casserole and added broccoli and used a lighter sauce. He flipped out and said I’m trying to push my “get better looking” agenda off on him even though my efforts to get in shape have nothing to do with how I look. He then accused me of being sick of him and using my workouts as an excuse to get away from him, which is completely untrue. I enjoy our time together and my workouts right now are only about 40 minutes because it’s all I can manage so I’m not leaving him alone that long.

He then said that he would drop it if I would go back to cooking and eating the way I used to. I told him that he was more than welcome to cook the way he wanted but he refused and left in a huff.

While he was gone I called my sister to try to get some perspective. She sided with my husband and said I was being TA by not providing him with the “fuel” he needs for his physically intensive job (even though the food I’m making now is more nutrient dense than it was before) and that just because cooking was one of my tasks in the relationship didn’t mean I should be the only one with any say in how things are made.

1,"AITA for telling my kids they're allergic to sugar when they really aren't? | I have 2 kids, both in their 20s.  I've always been a single Dad since they were a toddler/infant.   

&#x200B;

I severely limit my sugar intake.  I rarely even eat fruit.  Rarely eat any carbs that aren't also high in fiber.  Its pretty much just meat and veggies.  I have raised my kids this way, more or less.  I think the sugar industry in the US is disgusting.  I think we're poisoning our kids and ourselves with how we've normalized the amount of sugar we consume.  Thats my stance, and I generally keep it to myself.  I'm not interested in criticizing others on what they put into their bodies as its none of my business.  In situations in which people try to force me to eat something with sugar is simply say, ""Can't.  I'm allergic.""  And they immediately back off.  I learned this tactic after many conversations in which people were personally offended I didn't want to eat their donuts/cookies/cakes simply because I didn't want to eat sugar.  

&#x200B;

If you have ever been a parent of small children, you know that everyone loves to dig in their pockets and give your little kids sweets. 

 This old half-wrapped werther's original that some stranger pulled out of their pocket covered in lint, I'm supposed to let my kid eat?  I always turned them down by saying my kids are allergic to sugar. Worked perfectly.  When the kids first started going trick-or-treating I said the same thing.  I took their bags and told them since we're allergic to sugar, they can only eat 1 candy a day...maybe 2 on days they're really good.  Shit lasted the whole damn year (I always checked expiration dates).  We all have other food allergies too, so it was easy to get them to believe me.  

&#x200B;

I don't even remember specifically telling them they're allergic to sugar since they were like 6.  We just lived our lives relatively sugar free.  But fast forward 20 years.  We're at a holiday get-together and someone offered my daughter, now 25, a slice of cake.  She says, ""I can't.  I'm allergic to sugar.""  Later, I pulled her aside and said, ""Taught you well, young padawan.""  She didn't get it.  I'm like dude, we're not actually allergic to sugar we just say that to people who try to force us to eat the shit, right?  I did it when you were younger, and now you're carrying the torch.

Her jaw dropped.  She was not faking it, she honestly thought they were allergic.  She yelled at me, then yelled at her brother to yell at me too.  Son didn't care, he laughed.  But Belle was pissed.  She called me a liar and other bad names.  She asked me if they were even allergic to milk.  I said, ""You tell me.  You drank 2 glasses of egg nog at thanksgiving then shit yourself?""  Its been a week and she's insisting her entire life has been a lie.  Again, my Son doesn't care.

1,"AITA for calling our friend by a name my bf doesn’t like? | My boyfriend and I (also male)have a “friend” (we’ll call him Dave). I use “friend” in quotations because our relationship is very strange. 

Backstory: Bf and I have been together for 7 years. Dave got my bf a job, and is now getting him a job to work directly with Dave. Great, that’s a pay raise and my bf seems really excited about this job.

So my bf and I always thought Dave was a very attractive man, and would talk about him  casually (that’s a great part about being in a gay relationship). One night while we were out drinking, we ran into Dave. Here’s the first issue: I went home because I knew I had enough to drink. My bf decided to stay out (he’s an adult, I trust him nbd). The next morning when I woke up, my bf told me that Dave was gay. My bf went back to Dave’s place (we had done so a couple times before) but this time he put the moves on my bf. Bf was shocked and said he casually and quickly left.

After some talks, my bf, Dave, and i decide to just go for it. We fooled around a couple times, everything was very casual. But I noticed that Dave seemed to prefer my bf. I get it, I’m used to it. I’m not a huge guy but I am bigger than my bf, and Dave told me he preferred skinny guys (my bf is skinny). This caused me a lot of self-doubt and I decided I was done with this whole mess.

After talking to my bf about this, he agreed that everything needed to “cool down,” yet we would still find ourselves back at Dave’s despite me not wanting to. This whole relationship was causing a lot of stress on mine and my bf’s relationship. 

My bf started going to Dave’s house after work by himself (not often, maybe once or twice a week) I was very uncomfortable with this, as my bf has had some infidelity issues in the past. He insisted it was no big deal. I offered to just join them, I’ll just play a game on my phone while they talk or whatever, but he was insistent on the fact that they had to be alone. Weird, right?

After some sleuthing, I did discover that some things were going on behind my back. Nothing too crazy, but a lot of emotional cheating and a little physical cheating as well. 

Obviously this didn’t go over well. I was ready to end things with my bf. After talking, we agreed to work it out. He agreed to focus on our relationship more and focus less on Dave. Great! But he still goes to Dave’s house once a week by himself. He says it’s all work talk but and insists nothing else is going on. I’m trusting him on that.

So... Anytime bf goes over to Dave’s house or I see his texting him I’ll refer to Dave as “Mister Mistress.” I do it as a joke to make me feel better and try to be lighthearted about everything.

My bf has mixed reactions. He usually gets pissed off and tells me not to call Dave that name. Sometimes he just laughs it off, but I can tell it annoys him.

No one really gets a long with her, she’s a bit of a drama queen, selfish, hates that our family is so close and despite our attempts at becoming closer with her, she just isn’t having it. However, I still try with her, a lot.

We ended up getting pregnant within months of each other. My third, her first. I offered to throw her a shower when the time came as I wouldn’t be having one since it’s my third kid. She gratefully agreed. We actually became a lot closer because of our pregnancies. She was still a bit of a bitch, but I could tell she was trying, especially with the baby.

I ended up having what would legally be considered a still birth at 20 weeks. It was traumatic for myself and my husband. My sister-in-law was really great, she and my brother took the boys for us during this time.

Fast forward a few months and I’m still struggling. The baby shower for my sister in law is coming up and I don’t even feel like going much less throwing it. I asked a different SIL if she could host, which she agreed. I explained to sister in law the change of venue and said I probably couldn’t come, explaining that these days are hard and I just couldn’t handle a party dedicate towards babies.

She got upset and told me I was letting her down. I pointed out our other SIL’s house was bigger and that her friends would like it better. She told me that I should still come and I said it’s too hard, in response she called me selfish.

We went out with friends, we got drunk, her especially, we went back to her place. She lives with 2 guy roommates in a 3bed 1ba. All of us were hanging out in the living room chatting and drinking some more.

Anyway, she leaves saying she's going to bed. I tell her ima finish my drink and I'll join her.

10min or so later one of the guys gets up to go pee. Walks to the bathroom then calls me over saying ""hey I should check on Jen"". So I walk over and she's pantsless bent over the toilet and it looks like she had thrown up, her butt facing the door. Anyway, I wake her up, sit her against the vanity, and try to clean her up. 

One of the roommates asks if he can pee.  I say go ahead because I'm more worried about her. So he sits down to pee. She's still kinda out of it. She says she feels gross and wants to shower. I try to talk her out of it, but she's already trying to take her shirt off at this point. Dude's still peeing at this point but is looking away. I stand her up and tell her it's time for bed. She is insistent about this shower and turns on the shower and lays down in the tub. Guy leaves bathroom.

I figure i'll give her 5 min and then drag her out. I'm back in the living room and the other roommate says he's gotta pee and asks if it's cool. I say yeah. He goes to pee and comes back saying she was asking him for water. So I gotta the kitchen to get her some water.

1,"AITA for how I tried to get the baristas number? | Throwaway, TLDR below

So I (28M) went to a coffee shop. One of the cute baristas there prepped the drink and handed it off to me. There weren't any customers on-line, while there were 2 or 3 other baristas further in the room doing prep work. I wanted to ask her out, so after she handed me the drink I led with something like ""Hey, can I ask you a question?"" She replies yes, and I continue, ""Do you have any plans tonight? There's a really great band playing tonight and I have an extra ticket"" and yadayada about the show, ending with ""so would you like to go?"" She has a nervous smile starting now.  She says no, that she's busy with an early work shift tomorrow. I pivot to ""oh okay, how about next week? There are some really good shows coming up as well?"" She continues with ""I dont know (or I can’t – I don’t remember which), Im also really busy with classes.""

At this point, im getting the hint she's either deflecting because she really is busy or she actually isnt interested and doesnt want to say that flat out. I make it clear a third time, ""its cool of you're busy, then how about dinner at some point? If you want to think about it, maybe I can get your number and you can let me know if you are or aren’t interested? It's cool if you arent."" There's a silent pause (she kind of has an “oh shit” open mouth, eyes to the side look on her face), and she looks over to her coworker a few feet away.

Female coworker probably wasn't listening and notices barista's gaze. Coworker asks what she needs. Barista replies ""he's asking for my #."" At this point, I know it's the clearest sign she isn't interested. Coworker looks at/through me and says, ""No. Have a nice day"" with a clearly pissed off face. Embarrassed at myself, I return with ""you too,"" and walk off.

I thought about asking her straight for her number instead of whether she'd like to see a show, but thought that'd be too weird and straightforward. Ofc rejection is always awkward for both parties, and I bet people probably try to ask her out all the time. Plus, it's her workplace so she can't just walk away and could be put in a spot where she'd likely have to interact with the same customers she rejects in the future. I'm not looking to make her uncomfortable, but I think that's what happened (perhaps pissing her coworker off more so). I think their perspective may be

""Learn to take a hint.""

To give some rationale on my part, the last girl I asked out/dated for a bit was a cashier and she wrote her number down for me on the spot while working with people on the line behind me.

TLDR - I ask barista out to a show, she says she's busy, I ask her what about a future show next week when she isn't, she says she also has classes, I ask for her number to buy her dinner and say she can let me know if she is or isnt interested, barista tells coworker what I asked, then female barista coworker tells me ""No. Have a nice day"" with a pissed off face.

I didn't think much of it and just decided that if she wanted to talk, then she would talk (I didn't want to possibly constantly annoy her).

I tried to help her out by offering to tutor her, tell her why drugs could ruin her life ect. Her main response was ""fuck you.  You aren't my brother"". This hurt me (even though we were not close).

Few years past and I moved out, went to college, got a job, I saved up money and brought a really small house. Nothing big. A few times I invited my parents/stepsis over for holidays and such. 

One day, I get a call from an unknown number and it's my Stepsis who sounds happy. I was confused since she never contacted me previously. Basically, Stepsis was calling me to say thanks for letting her live with me and that she was already packing to prepare. She explained that ""Mom and Dad said I could live with you"". I instantly hung up and called my parents. In short, they got tired of Stepsis leaving the place a mess and smoking weed in their home, so they told her that I said she could live with me. I got angry and asked why they thought it was okay to say that without AT LEAST asking me first. They said they were going to call, but they thought I would say yes. I told them that she is NOT moving in with me. 

 I get a call from Stepsis who is screaming/crying at me through the phone. I explained to her that Mom and Dad DID NOT ask me anything beforehand. She starts to tell me that ""you're my brother! You're supposed to help me out! we never bonded and this could be a chance for us"". I finally got upset and told her ''No it is not. I tried so many times to get along with you and you ignored me. You said I wasn't your brother and always cursed me. I am not comfortable with you living with me. I'm sorry. ""

I hung up and my parents are angry with me because ""she just needs guidance"". I told them that she is now 17 and knows right from wrong and that I wouldn't be okay with her most likely doing drugs in my home especially when she never contacted me in the past before this.

0,"WIBTA if I moved out? | I'm 19 years old and live with my grandmother, father, and brother. It's very stressful living with them because my grandmother often snaps at me for everything. Usually, something bad will happen to her, and then because she's mad, she'll find something to yell at me for. For example, when she found out her basement flooded, she yelled at me for being asleep when she found out. When she accidentally lost control of her bladder, she yelled at me for bringing my video game system into the house. I know my dad's trying to save up money for a new place, but I just can't do this anymore. Especially when I know if I say something to contradict her, my dad will jump in and start getting in my ass as well. I work as a bank teller, so it was easy for me to set up a secret account without telling them so they couldn't have access to my funds. I've been putting a portion of my paychecks into the secret account and all of it's going towards moving.

What's eating me about this is I'm the only one capable of doing chores around the house at any time. Everything that gets done in the house is done by me. My grandmother's in her 70's doesn't have the strength or the energy like she used to. My dad has a bad back, but he's kind of a special case. He's morbidly obese, and his doctors have said that was the root of his back pain. It's easy to say he did it to himself, but I feel like that's just too cold. As for my brother, he's not mentally or physically disabled, but I would say he's... Challenged, for a lack of a better word. My brother *could* do the things I do, but my dad and grandmother feel like it would be easier to just ask me to do it.

I want to get out of this house so much, but I know if I leave I'm putting them in a bad position by leaving them to do things they're not physically or mentally capable of. Would I be selfish if I left?",False,False

1,"AITA for getting pissed at and blaming my brother's girlfriend for my spiralling mental health? | Just a bit of relevant background first. I've been working through some self-image and mental health problems, and have recently taken the opportunity of being on holiday to expose myself to situations that are difficult for me to try and build tolerance. These include: taking spontaneous pictures and leaving the house without prepping too much (beyond good hygiene).

During this time I've been traveling with family. I had considered this to be a good time to practice these things, especially as exposure is limited to strangers and family. 

However, a few hours ago my brother's girlfriend posted quite a few less than appealing tagged pictures of me (and other select family members) without asking permission to do so beforehand. This has led to me to spiral badly to a point where I haven't been for a long time, after putting in a lot of hard work.

0,"AITA for not wanting to let my mom stay the night? | Brief backstory here, I’m 23 and live with my boyfriend. We live in a small one bedroom apartment.

My mom relocated to live near me after I moved 1500 miles away from my problematic family at 18. I thought it could be a clean start and she might have changed in that time, but it is evident her narcissism, possible addiction, and mental illness still persist. 
Because of all of that, she has terrible credit and cannot rent an apartment of her own so she rents rooms from other people. Since moving here in August, she’s had 3 different living situations. We are always forced to take work off and help her move since she has no family here. 

In the beginning of March I let her stay on our couch for 4 days waiting for her finances to get in order to move into a new place. Then, within 10 days of moving in, she says that the guy she roommates with had to “refinish the bathtub” so she would have to stay the night with us.

I was skeptical because I didn’t understand why refinishing the tub would render an entire bathroom unusable for a 24 hour period. I asked her about this and she then said “well we have some kind of bug, I don’t know what it is, I wake up with bites so maybe he is bug bombing the house” 

This made me very concerned as we obviously don’t want to have bed bugs or fleas or any kind of bug in our house. It seems like she purposely tried to make it seem like the bathroom was the issue to not make the bug thing apparent before I agreed to let her stay.
I told her we didn’t feel comfortable with her staying here and would consider getting her a hotel room. She was upset that I would “think she has bugs” and I said she could stay as long as she only brought the bare essentials in a plastic sealed bag. (We are poor so could not afford to put her in a hotel anyway.)

Today, we were getting ready for work and offered to give her a ride back home. She was still asleep on the couch at 1:30pm. She said she would just find someplace else to go for the day and left abruptly, clearly miffed by me saying that it was time to go.

I really want to have a talk with her and explain that our couch is not a place for her to stay. We are adults with our own lives and I don’t feel responsible for taking care of her. In March alone she has been on our couch for five days total. 

I moved away from my family to NOT deal with this pervasive instability and now it has followed me.

1,"AITA for getting mad at my brother-in-law’s girlfriend for wearing an almost identical dress as me at a wedding? | I have been married to my husband for 1 year. We are both 38. He has a younger brother, 25, who has been dating his girlfriend (21) for 3 years. They are not engaged yet but she is very close with his family.

My husband’s sister got married Friday evening. There was a church ceremony and a evening reception. Leading up to the event, me and the other women in the family shared what we were wearing to make sure nothing overlapped or was too similar. It all worked out fine.

Then, at the evening reception, my BIL’s girlfriend showed up in this stunning red gown that was nearly identical to mine. Same off the shoulder neckline, same colour, same skirt, the only difference was the material. I was extremely pissed. I didn’t say anything to her during the reception, but a lot of people were complimenting her gown and saying she looked beautiful, gorgeous, etc. 

This morning after the reception, I told her I didn’t appreciate the stunt that she pulled with the dress. She said she was sorry, but at the last minute she decided that she liked the red gown better and that she didn’t remember what mine looked like. She told me to “chill out” and “stop overreacting.”

I just feel like she’s trying to upstage me for some reason. Of course people were going to compare us since we were wearing basically the same thing and sitting at the same table. And she’s a super skinny, tall fashion model while I’m a normal sized woman. Of course people are going to hold me up to her impossible standard. Frankly I think she knew this and just wanted to be cruel. I don’t like her and this just further solidies my feelings for her.

Worse thing is, she is being supported by literally everyone else in my hisband’s family. They all think she’s so gorgeous and sweet and can do no wrong. 

AITA? Or is she for being so blatantly petty and mean by wearing the same dress as me?",False,False
0,"AITA for hoping siblings will help care for our dying mom | This is a throwaway account.

My mom is 80 and I have been caring for her for 20 yrs. She does not get enough social security to afford living on her own and I made the decision to be with her. I accept responsibility for that. She has begged me not to put her in a facility and I have honored that.

I am the youngest of 5 and my siblings are a lot older than me. There is a lot of history here, but I have to keep it short. I will gladly answer any requests for more info.

3 of my siblings do very well financially and the other one gets by OK. 2 of them live close by and the other 2 live in another state. None of them have helped out with my mom over the years and I accepted that. I have been a single mom for 24 yrs and things have been tough at times.

My mom has been very ill in the past. I have worked 2 jobs and my adult son moved back home to help. My siblings who live close by did not help with getting her to dr appts, caring for her at home, or any financials. Despite this, they want to remain in contact, be kept informed of my mom's status, and have a say in her affairs.

My son, who was working and going to college full time, quit school to help. I did not ask him to do this and it kills me that he did. When my mom got better, my son landed a better job, saved up money, and prepared to move out again.

My mom then became severely ill with diabetes and was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. My son stayed home, I left my job and withdrew my retirement money so I could stay home to provide the 24 hr care my mom needs. My retirement money has since run out and now the burden is falling completely on my son.

My siblings think I should be home caring for our mom and they said they would help, but since having this discussion they claim they do not have extra money or time. I’ve been happy that they are successful and can afford many luxuries. I told them that I don't think anyone is obligated to provide assistance, but I would like for them to make their intentions clear so there are no false expectations or angry reactions to decisions I may have to make (e.g. one of my siblings was unhappy with potential funeral plans due to my financial constraints). I have to get a job and cannot leave my mom alone. She probably does not have long to live so we’re not talking about a situation that will drag on for years. I can try to work overnights while my son is home, but I don't know when I will get any sleep due to so many dr appts. My siblings have the resources to help, but they are not doing so. Yet they cry on the phone when discussing her impending death.

AITA for thinking they should sacrifice a few luxuries in order to help keep our mom happy in her final days and/or the ones who live close by at least help with getting her to appts and taking turns caring for her while I work since they claim to care and want to be involved in decision making?",False,False
1,AITA For quitting a board game? | Me and my usually gaming group were playing terraforming mars. For those that don’t know what that is the basic goal is to terraform mars and end with as many victory points as possible. Part of the gameplay includes things called generations where everyone takes turns going in a circle playing cards and using abilities. You go around as many times as you can until everyone passes and then the next generation begins. This was a bad game for me. Early on i drew basically only late game cards and mid game i drew cards that didnt do anything for me. About half way through the game i knew i had lost but i kept playing anyway. Then when the last generation started there was only two things i could do which were to build a city and a greenery. At this point I was upwards of 20vp behind everyone else and figured that there was not too much of a point in playing those two things so i passed my turn and let them finish up the game and went to play with the hosts cat since at that point i would have just been watching them play. When i did this i was scolded for being “that person” who quits the game when he knows that he has lost and everyone got really pissy with me.

1,"AITA Calling a coworker a rat faced goblin. | I have a feeling people at work think I’m an asshole for calling an older guy (50s) a rat faced goblin.

The back story is I’ve been working on a weld line for lawnmowers since July. I’ve always worked around this person but not directly. He’s about 5’5” and has unflattering features with a giant beer guy and a speech impediment. For this reason I tend to be overly nice to him intially. 

Everyone at work messes with him but in a big brother way. Probably because they see him the same way as me but they still mess with him while I never do.

However, I think the way people interact with him has caused him to feel like he can treat me with disdain and indifference. I assumed it was just that the fact I was new and young. The thing is though all the other workers help each other out and at the end of the day I usually sweep up the pile that everyone sweeps from their areas. Some guys will help out and do it if I’m busy. Basically it’s not beneath them. This person though will refuse, go out of his way to let me know the pile is ready even if I’m still cleaning up my area.

This has been going for quite some time but I ignore it because who cares. He gets to push around ONE person and maybe he needs it somehow.

The past week I’ve been going from a button pusher welder that runs a robot to welding. I ended up welding with this guy because it’s a two person job.

Immediately I noticed him sandbagging and acting like a douche, making other people check my welds and basically having a hostile attitude. I didn’t get it but whatever.

Well today I go back in and he’s even worse than ever. Refusing to weld his side unti i welder nine and had somebody check it. I wasn’t even making that many mistakes, I had improved. 

He started acting pissy and at one point started slamming his shit around and I just looked at him and said, “what’s your fucking problem.” He mumbled something I couldn’t understand so I called him a, “fucking rat faced goblin.”

Every one knows what I am doing and I get things approved.

I don't approve, but I release I purposely did not release it. When my co-worker asked me if I had released it, I played dumb. I wanted her tell me that she went around me. She tried to play cool until I said I never released it because I wasn't sure where it came from because no one came to me to get it approved by a manager. She got mad at me because she needed it sent out ASAP and now she had to tell her boss it was going to be late. Had she gone to me instead, it would have been taken care of.

I’m sorry if that was too much info but I’ll get to the point now. Well yesterday my friends and I met up to wait for our buses to come after school. We were talking as usual and just acting normal. Now I had my hand on my girlfriend’s butt. I intentionally had it between her backpack which she had on so people wouldn’t notice. Well someone did, and decided to point it out to everyone. They then started making gay jokes and pretending to touch me which I have said multiple times that I don’t like. Then today before first period my girlfriend and I separated from where the group was sitting so we could talk. She had her leg on top of mine and when someone walked over towards us they acted super annoyed. We played it off like nothing. Now after school we were at the same place as yesterday and I again had my hand on her butt and again out of view unless you were intentionally looking. Well one guy checked and punted it out to everyone that I did. They said it was annoying that we didn’t show any space from each other. They said we were being aggressive and that we don’t have to do it. We said that we can touch each other without being judged and that as she was busy all week that we only got to see each other at school.

0,"AITA for not going into work when they call me to come in | here’s some context and a bit of a rant i guess. It’s retail. I’m a cashier at a grocery store. If you’ve worked retail before you know how it gets. It’s sucked the life out of me. It’s at the point where I wake up in the morning hoping i get into a car accident before i get to work and before i go to bed, i wish i don’t wake up. And it’s only been a couple weeks. Now this is a temporary job. I’m in college and thankfully in a few months I can leave if I so choose because school starts in August, and find somewhere I’d be more interested in working. 

The staff at work are understanding and nice to me although sometimes they make me mad. But overall they’re pretty great. The customers are what get me. “The customer is always right” my ass. These people are the epitome of difficult. They are rude, they are apparently blind, and they are demanding in every way. Most, anyway. 

We have a big turnover rate. People either leave after a couple weeks or just don’t show up and don’t call. I’ve been getting called in on my days off and I’ve just been ignoring the calls. It’s not that I’m sitting around doing nothing on my days off. I have a house to take care of due to my grandma being older and not able to do a whole lot. Plus I make plans around my work schedule as soon as I get it and usually do not like cancelling on short notice. Not only that but it is a break from the constant barrage of customers and the problems they bring with them. 

Now you will probably say, “society_man, it’s more money, suck it up, this is your job”.  My reasoning is this. If someone calls off on short notice, or doesn’t show up, that isn’t my problem. If they have their reasons that isn’t my business and I’m not gonna be mad at them for it. My store has like one or two cashiers at any given time so if one doesn’t show up, we’re fucked. Them not scheduling more people isn’t my fault. I am not going to spring into action and become the person they depend on every time this happens. I’ll show up, do my job, and leave when my shift is over. Nothing more nothing less.

This just happened a few hours ago and I want to march in Monday morning and cause a huge scene. A little background, I work at a local wholesaler and have been looking for a new job. My co-worker also had applied at the place that I was looking at working at but for a different position. I was talking to her and she said that she didn't want the job after going for a interview and that she was just going to stay where she here for now.

0,"AITA for refusing to pay an old debt? | So this happened about 8 years ago and still has ripples of tension in the family.

My great-grandmother gifted me her old car.  The car was a bit of a lemon, had several things wrong with it, but I was very appreciative.  I put several thousand dollars of repairs into that car over many years.  Eventually, it was getting to the point where I needed a new car.  I asked her if I could buy the car from her so I can use it as a trade in for a new car.  

She said sure and she was willing to sell it to me for the value of trade in and had me sign a napkin stating so.

As it turns out, the trade-in was only worth like $1000 because of the physical and mechanical damage.  I told my grandmother that I was able to trade it in for $2500 because I didn't want to hurt her feelings and I wanted to repay her kindness for letting me use the car in the first place.

Well, about $1000 into paying her off, she passes away.  About a week after the funeral, I get a notice from my Aunt who has been appointed the executor of the estate and asks what my plan is to repay the $1500.  

I tell her the full story and politely ask if the debt can be forgiven.  She gives me a very brash ""NO"".

When my grandmother passed she had no debts. She had about a hundred thousand in stocks and bonds that all went to my aunts on top of about $250,000 in real estate.

There was a lot of back and forth about ""It's not about paying us, it's about her estate"". My argument was ""My debt was to her and she's gone."", and I fulfilled my obligation of paying her the trade-in value of the car.

After that, I got an email saying ""You can either pay this debt or you can be out of this family.""  I told her politely to pound sand.

My wife and I are both  successful professionals and make a great income. We have an awesome house that we can afford in a great high-end community that is far too large for us, but my wife loved when we saw. In summary, everything is great. I'm not complaining and not bragging.

&#x200B;

The issue that I now face is that my parents are pushing to give me and my family a lot more money. They want us to sell our house and upgrade it. They want my wife to quit work (we could afford our life on my earnings alone, but less comfortably), and take care of the baby. My wife neither loves nor hates work, but isn't sure what she wants to do yet, but wants to keep working while she decides

&#x200B;

My parents are getting  frustrated that I continue to reject their money. The problem is that my younger sibling and their spouse are less  well-off than my wife and I, and have been reliant on my parents for over a decade, even taking a few financial bail outs. Based on my sibling's experience, the cost of accepting the money is that my parents are far more involved, and I would say intrusive, in my sibling's family's lives. Not just being active parents/grandparents, but demanding involvement in decision-making and pushing for a constant presence that I feel is too much.

&#x200B;

I want my parents involved by being present, but I have communicated my desire for independence, both financially and in decision to my parents and sibling. My parents, however, just keep pushing and my sibling feels like I'm making his family look like  beggars by not taking the money. My wife is supportive, but obviously would like the extra financial freedom. As an aside, there are no taxation benefits or detriments either way.

So my question for you, good people of Reddit, AITA or am I being unreasonable? And yes, relationship advice accepted. Thank you.",False,False
1,"AITA I told my ex I'd bring the kids back and didn't. | ThrowAway/Mobile his gf is on here. Fake names.

Tim (M40) and I (F29) don't have the best relationship but try to make it work without involving the courts, we broke up 2wks after our 2nd was born and he met Ann (F30) 2mths later before he went to rehab. They became best friends amd then They started dating 5mths after he got out. He has been clean 5yrs. We had an agreement, Tim could have each of our kids live with him an Ann for one year each. This agreement came about because the eldest was displaying serious behaviour issues and where I lived (PG), 3hrs drive from Tim, there was no help for her. Last yr he had our eldest (Lyn7). I believed Lyn had celiac disease, Ann disagreed and got her a blood test, this was trumatic for Lyn. Ann said if Lyn did have it then she would need to adhere to gluten free foods and see a dietitian. The tests came back negative for CD. I believe Ann did it because she doesn't like me. I told her Lyn is allergic to cows milk, and gets seriously bad rashes, so she one-upped me and only gave her soy milk and no sugar ice blocks, or soy ice cream. Ann then told me that the reason Lyn was having having (the reason I believed she was CD) was because of white bread and its common in kids. She also said the Dr believed Lyns behaviour was due to sugar. I think thats bull.

This year I was moving up to where Tim lives (GE)I thought it was important for the kids to have a strong support network. I moved in with a friend while my youngest (Bea6) moved in with Tim and Ann. Tim put Lyn under my name so I could start getting money for her and look for a house of my own. As I was moving I started dating a guy from PG. I thought I should keep my old place in PG if I couldn't find a house in GE. 

The girls were happy being together, Ann put them in swimming lessons (I wasn't happy), she would read to them everynight, help them shower, pack lunches, Tim would help wash their clothes, make breakfast, and they would help Bea n Lyn with Homework. Ann help Bea settle into her new school. Ann's family, parents and siblings, love the girls, they call her parents Nana and Poppa and get treated with no difference to Ann's nieces and nephews. Anyway, I could see them whenever I wanted. But after 5 weeks I wanted to be with my BF, he couldnt move down to me, he had his kids in PG.

I got my BF to help me move back into my old house, get Lyns birth cert and secretly enrol my kids in their old school. I asked for my kids for the weekend and said I'd bring them back. But I didn't. Tim has gone to the lawyers and Ann won't answer any calls from me. Tim said Ann is broken hearted and cries, but they are my kids. It was never her place to pretend to be a mother. I told Tim that he can see them for a week in the School Holidays. I think the kids needed to be with me as I am their mum and can take care of them better. But someone on FB said what I did was cruel to the kids and I was an asshole for 'destabalising' them. I don't see how. Tim and Ann just want the kids for the money and thats all.",False,False
1,"AITA for telling a guy at a Magic the Gathering event that he smelled bad and needed to shower next time? | This story came up from a few years ago and I wanted to check in and see if I acted assholish.  This all happened several years ago around Worldwake release for the MTG players out there at my local game store.  

So when I used to play weekly at the store there was this kid Kyle who clearly didn't shower very often but tried to hide it with axe body spray.  Me and the rest of the regulars just sort of tried to ignore it and we all avoided Kyle whenever possible to avoid the stench.  Eventually it got to the point that me and another player went to the owner/event coordinator and asked him to please do something about it, but he refused to get involved in ""petty drama.""

We were angry because we felt it was the owner's responsibility to handle what we saw as a player being disruptive due to a lack of personal hygiene so the next week when Kyle showed up the other player and I told him he needed to start taking a shower before coming to play because he smelled bad and several of us were sick of it.  He simply called us both dicks and sat down to start playing. 

Now this is the part where I think I might move into asshole territory but I'm not sure.  Several minutes later but before people started playing I called Kyle out in front of everyone saying how he is way too old (at least 16 at this point) to not know how to bathe himself before going out in public and subjecting a room full of other people to his horrible body odor.  At this point several other players nodded and expressed agreement while the majority of the room stayed awkwardly silent.  Kyle picked up his things and ran out of the store crying.  He never returned.

My friends all believe that I was an asshole for calling him out like that while I think that after trying to talk to the owner and having a semi private talk with him beforehand left me with no other option than to subject myself to his stink or have to quit a hobby I enjoy.",False,False
0,"AITA for not speaking to my father after he dropped my brother and sister? | My dad dropped my brother and sister for “lying” to social services about his girlfriend popping pills. He eventually stopped letting them see him and me as punishment while I started being treated unfairly. I did chores and watched my two cousins under the age of 3 (one being an infant) while my dad’s girlfriend’s son went and spent quality time with him. Her son also had a habit of peeping in on me changing in my room (I’m a girl) and when I brought it up it was ignored. I even cried to my dad telling him that I missed my siblings and wanted them to come back and he watched me cry in front of him for an hour while giving me a speech about how he tried and how his girlfriend was such a nice person. 

When I finally decided to see my siblings myself and not through my dad, I thought it would be great. But when I didn’t show up to his house he freaked out, almost called the cops, and yelled at my mom at work saying he’d get his visitations. I was terrified he was gonna force me to go with him, but my step dad intervened and told him I wasn’t going anywhere I didn’t want to. After that, my dad picked my brother and sister back up like nothing happened. The last time I told him I wasn’t coming over he said “whatever I don’t care anymore”. He dropped my brother again and my sister says our dad misses me. It’s been 5 years and my story and opinion haven’t changed and his has repeatedly.

Am I the asshole?",False,False
0,"AITA for ""paying someone else to do my chores, so I don't have to grow up""? | Title aside, I think this is a more lighthearted question.  (Though you guys might scream at me, who knows!)

Live with my fiancée, we own a house & we both work full time.  Neither of us particularly enjoy doing chores but we've split them more or less 50/50, loosely based on ability/practicalities.  E.g, my work has flexible hours so I always do the morning dog walk because it matters less if I'm late.  That sort of thing.

I've suggested in the past about us hiring a cleaner to do the deep cleaning.  If we can just focus on keeping the house generally tidy, and pay someone to come in each weekend and finish up.  I was told, ""You just want to pay someone else to do the chores, so you don't have to grow up!""

For a quick bit of relevant financial info - we run the house, savings, bills etc from a joint account, but we both get an equal allowance each month to spend on whatever we want.  'Fuck it money'.  She tends to buy masses of cheap stuff from China, I tend to buy useless gadgets and Steam games I'll never play.  It works out pretty well :)

So, one of my chores is vacuuming (because I'm physically better with the vacuum on the stairs, I guess).  I honestly hate it, but that's fine... don't have to like it, just do it.  Until one day I had a big brained idea, I bought a robot vacuum cleaner!  I used my own fuck it money, since it was my chore to do, and it's been an absolute dream.  The carpet looks so clean.  So good that the next month I bought a 2nd (So we have 1 for upstairs, 1 for downstairs).  Now I only have to vacuum the stairs and the sofas, everything else is taken care of (I do the corners of the rooms, too, silly circular robots).

It sounds dumb, but I feel liberated.  I don't get all angry that I'm having to vacuum, and I don't feel guilty about ignoring the mess/putting it off til later.  The bulk of it just gets done & I can tackle the rest with ease.  This got me thinking again, ""Seriously, why don't we hire a cleaner?""  Imagine that I could pass this liberation onto my fiancée, too?  If we both took a cut from our fuck it money (cleaner is obviously a luxury not a necessity for the household)... but if past conversations are anything to go on... 

So my question, is it asshole behaviour to pay someone else (or a robot, or two) to do my adult responsibilities for me? Or would my opinion be justified that as an adult I can choose to spend money or spend time, as long as the job gets done, what does it matter?",False,False
0,"AITA for not taking down rack of plaid shirts? | I own about 10 plaid shirts, all different colours, I wear them all regularly, and my go to outfit is jeans, a tank top, and a plaid shirt. My dad hates that I dress like this and always pointedly asks me if I want to change or if I really need to be wearing that, and he's actually ""joked"" about burning my shirts on the BBQ before now, but I paid for them, I like them, and it's not like I'm making him wear them.

I'm reorganising my bedroom. My room is fairly small and I don't have a lot of space, so I decided to take out my chest of drawers and put a hanging shoe rack and some over the door coat hangers in. One is over my actual bedroom door holding my coats/jackets, and I decided to put my collection of plaid shirts on the other. There are other plain shirts on this rack but they're all buttoned and dad hates all of them. I can't hang them inside my wardrobe because due to my reorganisation the space they used to occupy is now taken up with jeans/joggers, non buttoning shirts, and shoes.

This rack was meant to go over my wardrobe door in a way that when it shut the shirts would be inside, but it didn't close properly, so I've had to hang it off the side of my wardrobe instead.

I finished everything up yesterday and I really like it, but dad has come in, seen the shirt rack, and just rolled his eyes. Next time he came in he asked if I had to put those there and I told him the wardrobe wouldn't shut with it inside.

Next thing I know mum's come in and told me to take the rack down, said dad's raging over it, wants the whole thing gone and is totally fuming. Thing is, I like it. I don't want to take it down. It took me 2 days and a fair chunk of change to get everything just how I want it, I don't want to change it.

AITA for not taking it down?",False,False
0,"AITA for spoiling a show for my boyfriend to prove a point? | Whenever we watch movies or TV shows together, my boyfriend does this annoying thing where he will try to predict what will happen. He does this continuously throughout the show, at least once ever 5 minutes, and often will interrupt intense moments with his predictions which I find ruins the experience for me. Like, in very suspenseful scenes where a character is obviously in danger, he will say something along the lines of “he’s going to die”. I also will add that his predictions are wrong more often than not.

I have talked to him many times and told him that it annoys me and ruins the mood but his behaviour has not changed. I’ve also tried my best to compromise and suggest that we discuss after we finish an episode what we think might happen next or he does it less often and not during important scenes but have not had any success with that. 

This has made me not want to watch any shows or movies with him so I now mainly watch Netflix alone. One show we do still watch together though is Stranger Things. When season 3 came out and I realised that I wasn’t even excited to watch it because I knew he would ruin it for me, I decided to take a stand. 

Basically, I binge watched most of the episodes in blissful silence before he came over and we started watching it together. Every time he would make a prediction, if it was right, I would agree with him and, if he was wrong, I would give my own “prediction” based on what actually happens. It took him a while to catch on but as the show progressed I got more and more specific with my “predictions” until it became obvious that I had already seen it. 

When he realised what was going on, he was really angry at me for giving him spoilers. I tried explaining to him that while his predictions don’t actually give the plot away, they still spoil the show for me and I wanted him to know how it felt. He then complained that I was being petty and taking revenge for something that isn’t even that bad. However, I believe I was justified as I had tried talking to him and offering compromises but he was unwilling to see things from my perspective or make any effort to change his behaviour. 

I guess I’m wondering if what I did was over the top or if I’m being irrational for even finding his habit as annoying as I do. Is making constant predictions a normal thing to do while watching shows? Some insight would be greatly appreciated.",False,False
1,"AITA for asking my sister to stop telling my kids that they should get straight A’s in school so they’ll have a lot of money when they grow up, especially since she herself has money mainly because she married a rich guy? | My family comes from a middle class background, but my younger sister Nicky married into old money and now lives a very comfortable lifestyle. She and her husband Joel don’t have children yet, and they love to spoil my kids, who are 6 and 4. 

My problem is, every time Nicky and Joel buy my kids gifts or takes us on vacation, Nicky tells them that they should study hard and get straight A’s in school so that they’ll have a lot of money to buy the things they want when they grow up. 

I don’t want my kids to feel pressured to excel academically, because that’s what my parents did with me and Nicky and I hated it. I also don’t want them to grow up materialistic or think that money is the most important thing. 

The tipping point for me was when my husband Ben and I were looking at TV’s online and I made a comment about how I like a certain model but it’s too expensive. My son said something along the lines of “Why don’t have you have the money to buy the TV you like? Didn’t you get good grades when you were in school?”, which is definitely something I don’t want him to say to other people.  

The next time Nicky had gifts for my kids, I took her aside and said that while I’m very grateful that she and Joel are so generous to us, I want her to stop telling my kids that they should get straight A’s so they’ll have money when they grow up. 

Nicky was surprised. I explained my reasons, and she replied that she just wants my kids to be happy that’s why she buys them gifts, and she wants to encourage them to do well in school at the same time. She said that I get the final say about my children so she won’t say that anymore, but she doesn’t understand why I think it’s wrong to say that since our parents said that to us too when we were younger. 

I told her that our parents saying that made me miserable because I felt pressured to get good grades. She said that I might not have liked being told that then, but it was for our own good and because of it we are now in a good place financially. 

At that point I felt that she was being passive aggressive, because she knows I didn’t do as well as she did academically and I’m not yet in a good place financially. So I asked her if it was really straight A’s that got us there because for me it’s my work that puts food on the table and not my grades, and she and Joel don’t even use their degrees because Joel’s trust funds cover everything. 

Ben said that I went too far by bringing up Joel and Nicky’s finances and making it seem like Nicky wouldn't have money if it weren't for Joel. My best friend Kim says it’s fair game because it was a fact that I just pointed out, and as Nicky said herself, I get the final say about my children so she should have left it at that and not asked me to justify myself.

for the past week everyday my neighbours toddler aged child has come to our house and continuously banged on the door for at least 10 minutes until i get up and answer it, usually his mum will not even be with him as he has just ran out of their house or she will be at the end of the drive way, she is never actually with him at the door to stop him from banging on it, and even when i tell him my mum isn't home (thats who he wants to see) he wont stop banging, screaming or trying to come inside. usually i'll have to either let him inside to show him that no one is here or i just close the door and let him sit there screaming and crying until his mum decides to do something about it. personally if i wasn't working i wouldn't care like okay just let the kid in show him no one is home and then let him leave without a problem. but now everyday without a doubt he wakes me up and then i find it hard to go back to sleep so i'm not getting any sleep all because of this situation. i've asked nicely if the neighbour can get the kid to come down earlier in the morning so ill still be awake or in the evening so ill be up but she just says that at around midday he gets really upset from having to stay inside and he wont stop screaming until he comes down to my house, but personally i don't see why i should have to sacrifice my sleep because she cant get her kid to stop screaming unless he comes down to my house.

This has left me fed up


I (25F) have been with my boyfriend for 3  years.

Our relationship has been good, but lately the bad has outweighed the good, I'm trying though.

My boyfriend is God awful with money and is in debt.

He is always borrowing money, I shouldn't lend him money but then we argue and I just hate arguing with him.

He has borrowed £340 from me, three months ago.

I've finally grown bored of waiting for him to repay me, I know he has no plans of repaying me and luckily I'm not relying on the money,I've been telling him just buy dinner one night to make it up to me.

Today he got home and asked if I wanted to go out, to try and make it up to me for borrowing all that money

We went out, my favourite place and we had a great time.

He kept ordering me drinks too, and it genuinely felt like the start of our relationship again because we were happy 

Well it came to paying, the bill was £80.

He expected me to pay £60 of it

He hasn't been paid this month yet and owes his friends money.

I ended up paying.

0,"AITA for being annoyed about a screaming toddler in Chipotle? | I honestly have no idea if this is a dickhead move so I figured I'd ask Reddit. 

So I'm at a fairly crowded downtown Chipotle for dinner. In walks a woman with three small children and her S/O presumably. She sits the kids down and starts feeding them Taco Bell from next door. I don't even know about that move, but whatever. The woman's S/O was waiting in line to order. The smallest child (approximately 2) starts letting out blood curtling screams. First presumably because the mom wasn't unwrapping the taco quickly enough and then because she didn't want a taco. Here is where I have a problem, this woman did absolutely nothing to stop the child from screaming. She didn't ask her to be quite, or take her outside, absolutely nothing. Just let her continue screaming at this ungodly pitch. I developed a migraine and I guess I made a grimacing face because the woman then proceeded to tell me to ""get over myself."" I was so stunned I didn't even respond. 

I know I'm entitled to feel annoyed about whatever I want but as a future parent (or I guess just general person) are you being an asshole for being annoyed at someone for not stopping their young child from screaming? I understand kids will be kids but the fact this woman made zero effort to make it stop was what really frustrated me.",False,False
1,"AITA for telling my sister to get over her dumb fear? | So my (m15) sister (f18) got stuck in an elevator last December. She was going outside from a parking hall that was really empty and it was pretty late, so she had to wait a while (almost an hour) before some people came to help her out. 

Ever since then she's been very scared to take elevators and takes the stairs instead anytime she can. I think that's ridiculous, because it's been a long time since she got stuck and she wasn't even stuck for that long. I think it's annoying and stupid to use the stairs and make others wait. 

Last night we were all going to a restaurant to celebrate our dad's 50th birthday. We parked in a parking hall headed to the elevator. She said she's taking the stairs and I said ""You know it's so annoying when we have to wait for you."" And she said ""it's not for long, we're only 4 floors down."" And then I kind of raised my voice and said something along the lines of ""If it's such a short time why can't you take the elevator? You act like you have PTSD just get over yourself."" 

She then called me an idiot and went to the staircase. In the elevator my parents said I was being mean and not to talk like that again. I think I was justified because she's basically an adult and being such a coward it's getting on my nerves.

0,"AITA for asking my daughter Why are you here? And telling to leave the house on Christmas Day? | My 21 year old daughter has type 1 diabetes and is insulin dependent (since diagnosed at age 11). She is also bipolar and non compliant with taking her medication.  She has been living with her boyfriend for over a year until recently.  A few weeks ago she asked to move home, away from him because he was being abusive to her. Of course we welcomed her home.  Since then she has quit her job and refuses to do anything around the house (like clean up her dishes or clean the bathroom after she uses it).  She eats everything in the refrigerator and drinks milk like we have a cow continuously pumping for her.  She speaks surly and flippant to anyone that talks to her, which isn’t that often because she spends all of her time sleeping in her bedroom when she’s not eating.   

On Christmas morning she expected a ton of presents to be under the tree for her.  There were a few, including $200 DocMartens and some clothes.  She hated everything and told me to take it back.  Ok.  No problem I said. 

She of course had no gifts to give anyone in the family.  But acted as if that was our fault. 

My last straw was when she started calling her twin sister a Cunt and saying horrible things about her unprovoked.  So I asked her, Why are you even here?!  She said Fuck you.  I said ok.  But what are you actually doing here?  Again Fuck you.  I don’t need this!   

I agree.  So then Leave! I said.  And I went on with my day.  She left to go back with the boyfriend (he gave her a small diamond ring for Christmas)  As she left she said that I don’t care if she lives or dies.  A bit dramatic.

0,"AITA for denying my best friend a luxury hotel getaway because of my abortion? | My partner and I had an unplanned pregnancy. (Condom broke, we used the morning after pill but I still ended up conceiving)

After consulting with my family, doctors and my partner, we decided for an abortion. Due to a recent health condition of mine that put me at risk, this was a choice made in regards to my physical and mental health. Neither of us were ready for a baby regardless, so this was the right decision for the both of us. 

Fortunately, despite this being the toughest decision of my entire life, my family, partner and close friends were very supportive. 

Seeing as I was only 8 weeks pregnant, we opted for the medical route (abortion pills). After taking the second pill, you get sent home and have the induced miscarriage there. To make this painful experience as comfortable as possible, my partner offered to book a beautiful hotel room near the clinic. (My home was over an hour away)

I was touched by his thoughtfulness and told my best friend, who hates my partner, by the way.  She wanted to join me in the hotel instead of him, to ‘support’ me. 

She went on to say that my partner should pay for a full spa treatment for the both of us. This comment caught me off-guard. 

I wasn’t going to the hotel for a fun, fancy weekend, but to be close to the clinic and have a comfortable and clean environment. Aside from that, my partner intended to be there for me and I *wanted* him there. 

This made her upset. She said that I chose him over her, was dismissing her needs for relaxation (she was stressed from work) and was being selfish and narcissistic. I should always chose my best friend over any man, she added. [Side Note: She was supportive 60% of the time, which I’m thankful for. But she also made remarks that it wasn’t that big of a deal, my fear was unjustified and only in my head, it wouldn’t hurt anyways, etc.]

It escalated a little, but ultimately the abortion took place and I went there with my partner, not her. No spa treatments, by the way, just the most painful experience of my life.

Afterwards, she kept bringing up that she should have been there instead of my partner. 

**AITA for choosing my partner over my best friend in this situation and denying her a luxury weekend? I’ll admit that we were both going through a lot of stress at our workplace, so I do understand that she wanted a spa getaway.

She had her phone and was texting someone and when she turned away I took her phone, she turned back and saw that it was gone and was quite frustrated. She spent the entire hour and next without it until it got pinged on Find My iPhone. I accidentally got her phone taken away since it was on my person and she had to pick it up at the end of the day. She finally talked to me only to tell me she was mad at me.

Everyone of her friends said it was a dick move but my friends told me not to let it eat me up and it has been since Valentine’s Day. Was I the asshole in this situation?",False,False
1,"AITA for opening up to my daughter about a conversation she's had with her boyfriend ? | I will call my daughter Laura and her boyfriend Mike. So laura and Mike have been friends since about 2nd grade, they went to the same school and had many sleep overs and little parties with friends and grew up together. I am also friends with Mike's parents. Now that they're both about 17, they started to date. I had a conversation with my daughter about how the sleepovers should stop as they are young adults now but shes begged me over and over and said nothing will ever happen. Of course I trust my daughter and I also trust mike but I think worry got the better of me. A week ago mike was at our house and they were both in Laura's room ready to sleep (we set up a couch like situation the other side of the room so hes NOT sleeping on her bed), anyway I wanted to check if anything funny is happening so I listened but I heard a really heart breaking conversation of laura telling mike that she never felt actual love growing up and that I was always lacking in many areas. Mike also told her many stories of him growing up and such but he was the least of my concerns atm. He was comforting her and they were talking about too many ""adult"" things like how they will raise their kids and their future together overall. After a couple of days I decided to open up to laura about what I had heard and she BLEW UP and got so mad that I listened in to an ""intimate"" conversation of hers and how they were being so vulnerable to one another and it was very ""private"". Since then, she hasn't spoken to me at all and even refuses to eat from the food I make. Am I the asshole or is she being too unreasonable ?

0,"AITA for not letting my ex tour my new house? | My husband and I are getting a divorce. It's kind of contentious. He and I both had a lot of unresolved issues that we brought into the marriage and everything basically imploded. He makes more money than me and he has a larger support system so he was given custody of our two year old son, Danny. I had to move out since my ex got custody and the house, and for the last month while I looked for an apartment or a house I lived in a hotel room. It wasn't ideal but I had to do it. I finally found a house, a small two bedroom manufactured home. It's small but it's clean and nice and in a good neighborhood near a park and other kids. I think my son will be really happy here with me.

I'm finally moved in, just finishing up some last minute touches, some unpacking. My ex finally brought my son to stay with me for a few days. My ex has a habit of being overly critical and nosy. The main part of the house is orderly and clean but the back part of the house still needs work. I don't have my bedroom unpacked, I'm sleeping on the mattress on the floor surrounded by boxes because I'm unpacking by myself without help and working a full-time job. My son's room is still in the final stages of packing; his toddler bed is put together, he has a dresser, but his toys and clothes are still in boxes and I'm making his room a priority, hence why I'm still sleeping on the mattress and my bed-frame is in a box.

When my ex dropped Danny off he asked to see the house. I knew he'd have something to say about every unpacked box, every piece of decoration yet to be hung, every piece of clothing still in a suitcase or box so I said no. He didn't take it well and threatened to tell our court liaison that I had something to hide. I don't think anything will come of it legally, because that courts have already deemed the house suitable, but my ex has primary custody and legally I have weekends and Wednesdays, my ex- was willing to let me have more time with our son, now he's saying we'll just stick to the custody arrangement until I start telling the truth.

Was I an asshole for not letting him see my house?",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting to talk to my relatives? | I (24F) had a pretty complicated childhood. To understand where I'm coming from, I have to explain a little bit. 

My biological mother was married to a man with whom she had two children. She then had an affair and I was the result of that. Her and her husband stayed together for a few years but when I was 5 they divorced. A lot of things happened in that time, but eventually we came to live with John (the husband). My half siblings are his biological children, while I was not. He never wanted me but he wanted to make my birth mother miserable, so he took custody of me too. 

He was not a very nice man. He married multiple times and blamed me when they ended. His children, my half-siblings, were also not very nice. They were cruel (slamming a door on my hand, among other things). When I was 11 he told me I wasn't his child and he sent me away to live with my aunt and uncle (his reasoning was that I was ruining his marriage, again). My aunt and uncle are wonderful people who raised me with a lot of love and I owe them everything. I have no contact with my birth mother. 

My half siblings have tried to contact me. John has too. But I never want to talk to them. They remind me of a very bad time in my life that I don't really want to think about. I also know that if I contact them, they will tell their father, and I don't want him to know anything about my life. My only issue is that my aunt and uncle have often told me I'm wrong to not want contact with them, mentioning that I will regret it when I'm older. 

AITA for not wanting contact with them? I don't feel like I am, but maybe some of you might have some different opinions?",False,False

I also had a miscarriage recently, so recently that I still look somewhat pregnant. This will be important later. The loss was not a secret. We had already announced the pregnancy and so we had to make announcements again when we lost the baby.

The story: SIL came to town and my family of 4 and my husband's family of 3 met up with her at a children's museum. My family arrived first and we eventually spotted the other group and walked up to them happy and excited for our fun day.

Me: There you are! You ready?

SIL: Oh my god. Your boobs are HUGE. They are seriously so big. I don't remember them being that big. Is that a baby thing?

I was so shocked and offended. My mouth actually hung open and though I was trying to think of an appropriate response, I was really surprised by what I actually said which was,
 
Me: Yes, SIL. I was recently pregnant. (in an admittedly really condescending tone)

I grabbed my daughter's hand and walked off announcing ""Let's go do something fun!""

1,"AITA for keeping £50 I found on the floor of my flat that belongs to my flatmate? | My flatmate is a lazy arse, doesn't clean, vacuum and thinks doing the dishes once a week is a whole task. Aside from this we get along fine. Today while cleaning I found £50, a few days before he complained about having lost money. I think it's fair game to keep it because I won't be doing anything crazy with it except pay for rent. I gave him a heads up that I found it but that I will keep it because I found it while cleaning, something he refuses to do it. Now he's calling me an arse and saying he desperately needs it. If he was that desperate he would have cleaned up his mess to find it, right?

0,"AITA for eating a small portions, declining treats, and commenting that I'm stuffed? | Wow, I barely know where to start. I started working at a company about 6 months ago, and ever since the very first week, I've felt weirdly... judged? Ostracized? I don't know what the term is, for what I eat and how I eat.

The thing is, I'm not even a thin woman. Lmao I wish I was, trust me, but I like to drink. I'm 5'1, around 145lbs, so I have a fair amount of chub I could lose. I tend to eat small portions. Whenever we go out as an office for lunch, it's a place with enormous portions, like Chinese where the lunch portion is easily 2-3 meals for me. I'll eat my portion and set the rest in a to-go box for the next day. Whenever there's cake in the office, I skip it. Grocery store cake is rarely ever worth the calories, and I'd prefer to save mine for alcohol. 

So about two weeks ago, the office had a pot-luck. I brought in some baked falafels and tzatziki. When it was time to eat, I selected very small portions of maybe 1/4 of the dishes. This seemed to really upset people. I ate my portions and people kept telling me ""Eat more!"" and ""But you didn't try my X!"" 

I said ""Sorry guys!"" and patted my stomach and said ""I couldn't eat another bite, I'm stuffed!""

A bunch of them got very angry looks on their faces. This is how it all started. I got called into my manager's office where she told me that some of my behavior and comments make the other women feel judged and bad. It was because of the stuffed comment, she said as much, that I guess it sounded to others like I was ""shaming"" them for eating a lot. 

I took what she said to heart and decided to just not talk about food and pass on meals out with everyone, but one of the women brought in cupcakes on Tuesday, I politely declined, she kept pushing one on me, I kept declining, and she will not stop telling everyone how mean I was to her because I wouldn't eat her damn cupcake.

0,"AITA for getting upset with my family for letting neighborhood children into my bedroom while I'm away at work? | A couple of months ago, I found out that my siblings like to take the neighborhood children into my room while I'm gone to play. My room is full of Pokemon, video games, and other nerdy collectables that I've spent years collecting, some of them were expensive. I don't really like the idea of kids that I mostly don't even know invading my room and touching my stuff. Sometimes I'll come home and find some of my stuff laying on my floor or rearranged on my shelves and get I'll get upset and they don't understand why. I feel like I have no privacy and I don't understand why they can't just let the kids watch a movie or play in their bedroom or outside. My siblings and my mom disagree because my collectables are toys and they don't see the harm in letting kids I don't even know go into my room as long as they are supervised and promise not to let them take anything and clean everything up. Most of my stuff are plushes or plastic so they aren't easily breakable. I also have a senior cat who is very skittish and especially scared of children and men with deep voices. They promised me they would start only letting them in my room if I was home and if I said it's ok, but I know that they still go into my room anyway while I'm gone sometimes.

Am I overreacting? I get that I have a bunch of toys in my room and that the kids think my room is cool, but it makes me really upset knowing that I have no say in who comes in and out of my room during the day while I'm gone and that they could be messing with my stuff and scaring my cat. Last night, I tried asking them again if they could please keep the children out of my room and they argued that because I now have a nephew, I should get used to having kids playing with my toys because I'll have no choice once he gets older, although I have already put aside some of my things that I would let him play with when he visits. They think I'm really overreacting and don't understand why I'm so uncomfortable and upset over this.

Also, I was planning on moving out by the end of the year now that I have a better job that doesn't pay minimum wage but I'm seriously considering moving out sooner just so I can have a peace of mind.

1,"AITA for giving my nephew dating advice? | So my sister's kid is a sophomore in high school and he's been getting into girls like most guys his age. I'm 26, so there's not that huge a difference and as such he's kinda seen me as the cool uncle or whatever. He's a great kid, but I know he struggles with girls since he's shy and too nice, so I sat him down and gave him a few words of advice:

* If she rejects you, move on. She means nothing and you're better off not having her around
* Respect a no, and then block them
* Keep multiple balls in the air, so you always have a fall-back, and a better chance of success overall
* Don't waste your time or her's with games and friendship shit, cut to the point and conserve your time

Anyway my nephew apparently took this to heart and told my sister about what I told him, and she is FURIOUS, telling me I'm teaching him to be a psychopath, and to not respect women. I asked her what *she* had told him and it was basically some ""make friends with girls and maybe, perhaps eventually you'll get a girl"" type shit, and I sort of laughed at the thought that this is what she told him. 

Anyway she's really pissed and a couple of our mutual friends think I'm an asshole as well. Am I the asshole?

0,"AITA for telling my sister not to spend time with my daughter? | Throwaway account, you get the idea.

Some background: My \[32F\] sister \[25F\] recently came back to town after being in and out of my life for basically all of her adult life. She usually makes a brief stop off at my house after she's run into some issue or needs money or a place to stay, and all of this I'm fine with. She has a history of drug and alcohol addiction as well as mental health issues so I try to help her as much as I can, and I do genuinely love her. When she's in town, we get along really well to the point that I'd call us friends.

Most recently since we moved house a couple years ago my sister has had to stay in my daughter's \[15F\] room until I can find her someplace more permanent to stay. In the past my sister has never shown any interest in my daughter but they've actually become quite close, I guess because my daughter is a teenager now. 

Last week they came home together after taking a walk together, and plainly speaking my daughter was drunk. She vomited in the bathroom later that night and woke up with (I assume) her very first hangover. This is not the first incident that I suspect has happened and I hate that my sister thinks it's ok to do this behind my back.

I was livid and confronted my sister who said that she wanted to do it, and it was fine because she (my sister) was supervising. I told her that I didn't want her being a bad example for my daughter and told them both that I didn't want them hanging out anymore. I had my daughter when I was very young and was very much like my sister is now back then, so I think that had an effect on her upbringing. I love my sister, but I don't want her doing the same to my daughter.

0,"WIBTA if I won't visit my parents anymore if they won't stop pressuring me about having a child? | English isn't my first language so please excuse any mistakes. I've (24F) been together with my boyfriend (26M) for a bit more than 3 years and after one year (which was way too early in my opinion), my parents started to ask me if we wanted a child or not. Now the thing is I can't stand children, if there were a room full of spiders and a room with only one child, my arachnophobic ass still would choose the first one. So I said no. I think my parents didn't take me seriously and when they had the chance they asked my bf. He also said no. 

Now everytime we visit them this child topic always comes up and we end up arguing about it. Honestly, it hurts me that they won't believe me when I say I'm truly happy with my life, and I consider ourself (me, bf and our cat) as a family without children. My mom has two closets full of my and my sister's baby clothes because ""they will be useful in the future"". (Oh yes, my sister is 10 years older than me, she doesn't want a children either, but she lives in a different country so I'm the easier target.) I told her to give the clothes to charity or directly to families in need but she doesn't listen to me. My father is more passive-agressive, saying things like ""life doesn't have a meaning without family"", and of course family MUST include children.

Our visits become less frequent in the past months because of this tension and I know they are sad because we visit them just once in every 2 or 3 months. I asked them many times to respect our opinion, but I feel like they can and will continue to pressure us.

1,"AITA for not allowing my daughter to hang out with her Aunt? | My daughter just turned 16. She is very close with my younger brother and his wife. They got married six months ago but have been together for six years (since she was 19 and he was 25). My wife and I split up, I have two other children. 

My daughter and her aunt go out together all the time. They get their hair/nails/eyebrows done, and they like to go shopping together. Recently, Aunt has been buying my daughter rather skimpy clothes. Inappropriate undergarments, tight dresses, skirts, thigh high boots. 

After the inappropriate undergarments (I still do her laundry) I confronted Aunt about them. She told me they were for party lines and told me to calm down. We got into an argument because I feel as if she’s telling me how to raise my child. I told her that I’m the father and if I say it’s not appropriate she can’t buy it. Case closed. She rolled her eyes at me. 

Yesterday she picked my daughter up from school and they went to get their eyebrows done. My daughter saw a dress that she liked and aunt bought it for her. Another skimpy dress. I actually have the dress linked so you can see for yourself. 

I grounded my daughter, because she knew the rules, and I told aunt that she would no longer be allowed to pick my daughter up. They can hang out at my house, or I will be going with them to get their beauty treatments. 

Everyone is mad at me. My brother called me and “told me off” and said I was being a prude. I feel as if they won’t respect my wishes as a parent they should have limited contact with my child. Does that make me an asshole?

0,"WIBTA for cutting someone off for pulling off my wig in public? | Backstory: So I'm black, and I have really thick 4c hair that's just too stressful for me to maintain sometimes, so I just braid my hair in cornrows and wear wigs sometimes. It's simple, fast and convenient. Not many people can tell it's a wig so they always ask questions about how I get my hair like that. I usually just explain that it's not my real hair. 

Now to the meat of the story. Today, I was hanging out with one of my white friends in the library (finals week), studying together. We're making jokes on a break and just chilling. He starts to play with my hair but he's a very touchy feely person so I don't think much of it. All of a sudden, he pulls the hair and it falls off my head. In a room full of people. I was in shock. For like 5 seconds I didn't move. I put the wig back on in shame and guess what he does? Laugh. He doesn't even apologize at first he just laughs. I packed up my stuff and left. He's been texting and calling me all afternoon apologizing and saying that I have no reason to be this upset with him, that, ""most girls have fake hair, no one cares"". Well I care, and I think its stupid that the first thing he did was laugh. 

I'm not sure if cutting him off and never speaking to him again is overreacting/will make me an asshole, but I am boiling over with rage.

I love my nephew to death and would do damn near anything for him, but I'll also admit that I do get frustrated with him but know that he doesn't do it on purpose. As of late my sister has taken to telling me "" Varaskana, he doesn't understand. "" damn near any time I tell him not to do something. The conversation often goes like this ""Nephew, you can't grab your uncle's face like that."" ""Varaskana, he doesn't understand. ""

Now I fully understand the difficulties growing up autistic, being an aspy (a person with asperger's syndrome) myself. And yes I wasn't diagnosed untill my early 20's, but I'd still argue that out of anyone else in the house I understand his difficulties the best. Earlier this week my sister once again told me he doesn't understand after I told him that he can't grab my face and I had had enough and replied "" I understand that Sister, but if we don't keep telling him he'll never understand, and you talking down to me doesn't do you any favors.

Our agreement at that time was that we'd keep separate checking accounts plus a joint for household expenses, with the understanding that money left over after contributions to household expenses, savings, retirement, etc. would be put in the separate accounts and we could spend it how we wanted. My wife was the one who insisted on this, and although I was not a fan (wanted joint accounts for all funds), I agreed since she felt strongly about it.

A few years after we married I decided to go to law school. Long story short, I ended up at a big law firm and now earn about four times what my wife does. Since I managed not to go into debt, I have a good bit of money left over after I make my contributions to our joint expenses.

&#x200B;

My wife  asked me to reconsider this arrangement (she doesn't feel like its fair that I get to buy most of the things I want while she is on a much more limited budget), and I told her I would not reconsider it since this is what she wanted originally.

The boy’s mom called me last night to confirm that the boy (I’ll call him Tom) could sleep over. I said there must have been some miscommunication and I thought that she was picking up Tom at 10. I told her that if transportation was a problem my husband or I could drive Tom home.

Tom’s mom said that the issue was Tom wanted to stay over and would be let down if he had to go home. (Again, I don’t know why she thought he was sleeping over, since I made it clear on the invitation what was expected. We will have a couple other boys over who are the kids of family friends and they will also be leaving at 10 pm!).

My wife said that her family wants to see her and me together for the new years eve but I would prefer to spend it with my own family instead because that's where I feel more comfortable and that's where I can be my self  but when I'm around her fam, I'm basically on my best behaviour. That's why I rarely visit them or even talk to them on the phone. When ever one of her family calls her on her face time, I quickly remove my self and go to another room. Usually my basement/gaming room and she always calls me out saying it's rude to walk out of the room when her family calls her despite that I keep telling her that I'm trying to give her the space she needs just in case she is talking about personal stuff that I don't need to hear but she calls bullshit at that because she says that when I talk to my family on the phone, she always makes the effort to talk to them but I never ask her to do that and my family don't care that much about her. Yesterday she got mad at me for not spending Chrismas with her fam and for planning to spend new years eve with my own fam and I basically told her that while I like her fam, I love my family more and my family loves me more then her. Now my wife has been giving me the silent treatment and I don't understand why she acts like that? Am I an asshole for admitting what I admitted?",False,False
1,"AITA for insisting that a friend honor a stupid bet? | I’m the first to admit that there are no heroes in this stupid tale; I’d just honestly like to know whether the lion’s share of the assholery lies with me…

Anyways, this happened five days ago when I was over at a college buddy’s of mine. He still lives with his parents who have a pretty nice place and they’re currently abroad so it seemed like a good opportunity to invite some friends over for some mindless drinking. We’re not really all that close anymore- both about to graduate, we were tightest in the first few semesters, but still hang out fairly regularly. I guess you could say he’s more of a chad/business kind of guy, while I enjoy more erudite pursuits.. 

Anyways, I mention this because this friend (some bitterness writing this now, after what happened) had just been on a serious workout-kick for a few months and he talked our ears off about his gains. We’re the type of friends to pretty much openly poke fun at each other, so he was well roasted for his outspoken self-love..

Anywhos, as the evening went on and everybody got drunker and drunker, I openly told him that I didn’t think his biceps looked very impressive/defined. We’d been in the pool and all still sat shirtlessly around the edge, imbibing the Goose. For some reason this remark (don’t know how I worded it) shifted the dynamics of the situation. I guess he saw me as the kind of meek intellectual character of our group (think Sherlock or Yoda) and he appeared sincerely insulted.

He said something like “Think you can take me on, champ?”; I said I sincerely believed yes, but this conversation was stupid and not worth it so he should cool down now. Well, he said he never had fighting in mind, but no wonder I was pu\*sying out already. I laughed it off, and when he called me spaghetti-boy most people thought it was lame. He didn’t let it go though and proposed we should arm wrestle under the supervision of the others to settle the matter.

Now, I’m no chicken but I was really annoyed. I asked him why I should do this and insisted that I wouldn’t do it without proper motivation. He looked around thinking, then, seeing his little pug Opal, who’d sort of hung out with us during the course of the partying (running around). Opal was brushing up against me leg and he knew I adored the pupper, so he said: “You win, you get her.” He was so fucking sure of himself to make this idiotic bet. The only reason I agreed was because it made me legitimately mad that he could be so arrogant to pawn off that his dog, even when drunk.

Well, guess what. After a long back and forth and his shitty cockiness reaching a fever-pitch, I defeated him fair & square (three times). I took home the dog (who accepts me) and he completely FLIPPED OUT because I took him at his word. Opal is happy with me aside from some micturition issues and I don’t think this “friend” deserves his dog back, after proposing this demented bet. Who knows what he would do if he kept it?

So AITA for taking the moronic bet at face value?",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting to speak to my friend anymore after she ruined happy hour for me? | Backstory: I've been friends with this girl for 2 years now, we'll just call her A. A can be a very nice, caring person and good listener but also selfish and entitled, especially when it comes to doing work for/with her. Also she's the type of person who will always ask for your advice but will literally do the exact opposite of what you told her.

Actual story: about two weeks ago, we were at a club (basically our entire year was there, as we are graduating soon). Until 10pm, all cocktails were 50% off. I arrived at about 9:15. A greeted me by telling me that there was no space at her table for me, but no where else either as she hadn't reserved a seat for me (thanks, I guess?). Afterwards, I immediately got in line for some drinks. A was right in front of me and at about 9:30 it was her turn to order. She ordered at least 15 cocktails. The bartender started taking her order and A was being an annoying customer. Why? While ordering A would ask what was in every single kind of cocktail and how it was made. This question-answer-game took about 5-10 minutes. Finally the bartender started making the drinks slowly.

A kept interrupting her and asking why she was doing whatever she was doing at that moment. Another 10 minutes pass and not even half the drinks are made. People in line are becoming impatient.
It's 9:45 and A looks at her watch, turns around to us and says in the most smug way possible with a grin on her face ""oh well, you guys only have 10 minutes left, you better hurry up"". Another five minutes pass. Again A turns around ""well, that'll be close for you"". At 9:58, all the drinks are made. All A had to do was pay. A and another girl decided to split the bill and started arguing about who would pay what.
9:59, they start getting their small change out. They pay all the drinks that way which takes at least another two minutes. Well, happy hour might be over, but this story sure isn't.
I decided to pull a Karen and wanted to speak to the manager, A friend and I went looking for him and we met A, who asked us what we were doing. I told her and she replied ""hm, at least I still got MY drinks, so I'm fine"" while grinning and trying to blow me a kiss. I slapped her hand away and told her to fuck off.

A later comes up to me, telling me she's sorry I'm upset but it's not her fault, The bartender was being fast and I shouldn't be mad. She then offered me one of her drinks that I could just pay her for. I refused. 
About 20 minutes later A comes to me and starts yelling at me. She thinks it's stupid that I'm upset about that, I tell her to leave, she yells that she won't unless I'm not upset anymore about something stupid like this. I lost it and also yelled at her, telling her to fuck off. She then returns to her table and loudly tells people there how dumb I am being. Later she texted me, wanting to talk.

Haven't talked to her since. Some friends have criticized me for that, so AITA in this situation?",False,False
1,"AITA For giving my girlfriend a photo album filled with pictures of her for our anniversary? | My girlfriend (23f) and I (24m) just had our 2 month anniversary this past saturday and it was....less than ideal.

I am an amatuer photographer. Its a hobby of mine and I love capturing parts of the world, just freezing beautiful things in time so they can be preserved forever. And my gf is beautiful, so I figured why not take pictures of her?

Ive been following her to work and to her home (not inside her home just to the door), taking pictures of her from my car or discreetly in the store she works at (shes a cashier so shes stationery for long periods of time). I also took pictures of her eating with friends and I got the cutest picture of her drinking a soda but looking out the window.

While we were together eating dinner I had a friend of mine sit at a different table and secretly take pictures of us.

I organized all of these pictures into three ""Chapters"" in the album. Past, Present, and Future.

Past is her working retail as im trying to get her to quit and live with me as I have enough money to support us both.

Present is her enjoying herself with her friends, sort of waiting for what comes next and enjoying the ride.

Future is filled with her and myself together.

I thought this was very romantic but she did not react as id hoped. She was weirded out by me taking so many pictures of her at different times. She thought I hired a private investigator to do it and that i didnt do it myself. This itself offends me a little bit because I take great pride in my ability to get seemingly impossible shots stealthfully. I can get within a foot of a flock of birds without them noticing me and flying off.

This project also took me 3 weeks and involved me using my friend. I was upset at her reaction and i did somewhat scream at her. Not to mention the fact that she got me nothing in return. We are now fighting. AITA here?",False,False
1,"AITA for trying to command respect from my parents by leveraging their love for me? | So about a year ago when I was 17, my parents found out that I smoked weed. After that my our relationship turned into shit. We would constantly argue about it and they would argue that I would end up in the streets doing heroin or crack. I would tell them there is no way that is happening because I had no interest in doing them. Those arguments would always end up with them calling me a drug addict and when I would get mad and start shouting at them they would tell me that I am high and that it is making me overreact and emotionally impulsive. After a while they started getting so paranoid that they wouldn't even let me stay over at my friends' houses over the night (and it was not that common either) because they were stoners and they would start texting me at 3 am to come back and ask me whats my friends address to find me whenever I would say no. If I showed up high at my house they would start harassing me and I would shout at them for it and that would only confirm their beliefs that being high made me unreasonable and angry (it didn't). One time after we argued that they should let me go to my friend's house over the night because they let my sister got to her friend's house they said no because I have ruined their trust. So I sneaked out and once they found out they went to the police department after insulting me and made me talk to the police officer over the phone. They would rationalize their controlling behavior by saying that they want to protect me but I found them extremely disrespectful since they were not even protecting me from anything, their views on marijuana were based on the stereotype that all stoners are losers.

Eventually, I got so sick of it and whenever my parents would come tired and stressed from work I would argue with them not because I wanted to change their minds, but in order to apply more pressure to them and make them have a mental breakdown out of spite. I eventually stopped smoking weed because I didn't like it that much, I even threw my dab pen in the trash to prove to them that I was not addicted. They knew I smoked once in a while but they stopped harassing me since I had a 4.0 GPA in my first semester in college. It was too late by then, I had no respect for them and I would ignore most of their calls and texts for the entire semester out of spite which really hurt them but I had no remorse for them. I knew my parents loved me but had no respect for me, in their eyes I was just a depraved drug addict, and respect is the foundation of any relationship, love means nothing to me I am not being respected by someone, and so I would ignore them because I knew I could not change their mind but still wanted to punish them for it and force them to respect me by threatening to cut them off entirely when I was away for the semester. Fast forward to today and we had the same debate again and I got mad because they started calling me stupid for my life decisions and I started threatening to cut them off again.",False,False
0,"AITA for refusing to carpool with my roommate? | When my roommate moved in, he brought up the idea of carpooling to work and out to bars. I thought it was a good idea and mentioned how much money he'd be saving. When I said, ""we"", he just kind of laughed it off.

Since then, I have driven all the time with one exception. When I found out I was selected for promotion, he insisted we go out and I could pick the place. I was just planning a chill night in as it was Tuesday, but he talked me down. When we got to the parking lot, he said, because I chose the place, I should drive, which sounded fair. Next week, we go to a place of his choosing, and I end up driving because he ""left his keys."" I brought up the trend a week later saying it was causing me not to want to go out with him. He said that because he drives a truck, a 50/50 split isn't beneficial for him but agreed to a driving one out of every three times. I agreed but stated that because I've already given him numerous rides (we went out to lunch numerous times at work where always was the one driving), that we should do 50/50 for October. He agrees.

Yesterday, I stopped avoiding him and we were leaving around the same time and he recommends a carpool. I say yes, again expecting him to drive but I again end up driving. Last night, we were both planning to go to this new bar with a buddy and he suggests a carpool again. I put my foot down and tell him, only if he's driving. He insists on me driving because he doesn't know the place but I say neither do I. He says my car will blend in more and nobody will mess with as opposed to his truck. After no budging on my side, he suggests an Uber, which I decline. I say I'm just driving and he says he'll tag along. I tell him firmly, that if I'm driving, he will not be in my car. He says he'll but me a beer, but I'm firm on the principle of the matter. Plus it's literally one dollar beer night. I stop talking to him and he assumes that means it's settle an tried to tag along an hour later as I'm leaving.

I stick to my guns, and end up leaving without but we have an argument about how with the beer I'd come up even on gas and if I'm going anyway, I should take him. I'm bring up all the other times I've given him rides and him if he sees my side and my point. He blatantly denies seeing my point I go to leave. Before I go, I try one last time, even saying I'll give him a ride if he can see my side and why I want him to drive. He says no again and I leave. Now he won't speak to me. AITA?

0,"AITA for Getting Mad Over a Rock? | I went for a hike in a wildlife/nature preserve with my husband. We were admiring various rocks along the way. As we were leaving the preserve, I noticed that he was taking a rock -- not a small stone, but more of a 3 lb. piece of quartz or something like that. He was being stealthy about it, carrying it alongside his body in such a way as to hide it from the caretaker of the preserve, who we passed on the way out, so he knew it wasn't something he should do openly. I told him that it was a preserve, and that he should be taking nothing out of it. He claimed he ""wanted to study it."" (No, he's not a geologist.) Now this rock is going to sit around in our garage forever. He is  never going to look at it again, but every time I see it I'm going to remember that he wouldn't leave it where it belonged. I get that it's just a rock, but it is part of the ecosystem, and it should be there for others to enjoy. It belongs at the preserve. Am I wrong for being irritated that he took it?",False,False
0,"AITA for saying no when my roommate's girlfriend asked me to be quiet? | Hello all! 

So I live in a house with a few roommates, and my space is relatively close to another roommate. The walls are unfortunately very thin.

I'm rustling about sometimes on weeknights, let's say around 11 or 12 o'clock. Perhaps just straightening things, watching videos on my laptop with laptop speakers not fully turned up, etc. Nothing serious. 

Many times, my roommate's girlfriend (who does not live here, mind) knocks on my door and asks me to be quiet. From my perspective, she is quite a noise sensitive person, because I am not playing music or doing anything particularly loud. 

Now my roommate has never once told me the noise was an issue for him. I asked him if he had noise issues and said ""no I don't have any issues, and I sleep like a rock, but my girlfriend has issues so I guess you should talk to her.""

Now I was fine with this for a while, but one time I am literally watching a video on my Macbook Pro speakers on half volume in my own room with the door closed at 11 PM, and she knocks on the door and asks me to be quiet. 

Usually, I've been cooperative with her, but this time, I didn't accept it. My roommate didn't mind any noise, my speakers were not loud nor had any bass, and I'm in my own room with the door closed so I feel I have the right to watch my video. 

I told her that I would continue to play the video at this volume in my own home because I didn't think it was unreasonable, and that if she has issues with it she should talk to my roommate about it. 

Well my roommate doesn't care about the noise. After she went back to his room, I could hear them having a mild argument about it, with it eventually ending (I think) inconclusively. 

If my roommate was really bothered, I would act differently. But I have talked to him and he is not bothered, and it's just his girlfriend, **a person who does not live in my house, only a frequent guest, and does not (in my opinion) really get a say on what happens in it.**

My attitude is he has a good job now, and it is what it is and keep moving forward, however I understand this upsets him because hes worked very hard for it. So for the beginning of dinner before ordering, I listened to him and supported him and took his side and just be quiet while he vented. After we get our drinks, were sitting in silence and hes staring at the wall behind me with an angry look which is starting to make me uncomfortable. The waitress comes to take our order and he speaks to me in a gruff voice when she asks are you ready, he says I dont know are you? I told him to go ahead because I always go second. He says well are you ready to order or not, our waitress sensed the tension and now I'm embarrassed. I end up ordering the first thing I see, and when she leaves I tell him that that was rude and not appreciated. To which he blows up and says I'm causing a scene, I know hes upset so why am I tearing him down and talking down to him and accusing him of being rude, saying I tell him he does everything wrong. It could have gone way out of control, but I refused to argue over something so silly so we sat in silence for the rest of the meal.

0,"AITA for not helping a woman at walmart | I (male 24) started working at walmart for the summer about a month ago. My job mainly involves working with inventory in the back room and not on the floor with customers, sometimes we get heavy boxes that we need to lift as a part of our regular duties. 
One of my co-workers is a female (fcw) in her early to mid 30s, physically in good shape and as far as I can tell no physical disabilities. (Fcw) approaches me and asks if I can help her lift a heavy box, I say of course and I walk over to the box with her expecting us to perform a team lift - however we get to the box and as I get to one side of the box expecting her to go to the other she just stands there and watches me. I ask ""are you ready?"" And she says ""yes it just needs to go in that bin"" (referencing a metal shelving unit about 4 feet high). I say ""ok let's do it"" and she responds ""it's to heavy for me can you please lift it into the bin?"". I respond by saying ""I'm more than happy to help anyone if they're having trouble with something, but I'm not going to lift all your heavy boxes for you while you stand there watching me"" and (fcw) said ""if you're not willing to help me I'll find someone who will"" and stormed off. 
Later on the head guy on our team (not my boss just the guy with most seniority who directs us) walks up to me and said "" I just spoke to (fcw), the next time someone asks for help you need to help them, that's part of being a team. I responded by clarifying exactly what happened in case she stretched the truth and finished by saying ""we're both paid to do the exact same job and if she cant perform the tasks then she shouldn't have taken the job, I'm not the designated heavy lifter on our team and if you would like to discuss this further we can do it with HR present"", and at this point feeling pretty annoyed, it was my turn to storm off.

0,"AITA for not moving from my fishing spot | Anyone who has been to the beach in the summer knows it can get crowded. I dont mind the crowd and I do my best to avoid them but they dont avoid me.

I had been fishing this spot for a couple of hours and I was originally with a group of 4 other fishermen I had met today. As the day went on some of us left and it was only me and this other guy when a family of 6 came near us. 

At first the kids were just swimming in the shallow water but they slowly started drifting further and further which is usually fine except that they were not paying attention to how far they were drifting toward us(very annoying)

After about 30 minutes the mother came up to me and the other guy and asked if we could stop fishing since our casting area was now near her drifting kids.

I said no. I (as politely as I could stand) told her that we were here first and had been for a very long time and up until her family showed up we were staying in our own lane and others around us were as well.

0,"WIBTA for having a celebration for being sterilised? | I am a 28yo female. I suffer from an anxiety disorder which is massively amplified by birth control - I get week long anxiety spirals pretty much every other week followed by periods of depression over the things I’ve just been anxious about that haven’t even happened. The only time in the last 8 years or so that I’ve felt okay was when I came off birth control a couple of years ago to see how I felt and I felt fantastic, however I got stressed at the thought of accidentally getting pregnant and went back on it and I am really struggling again. 

I don’t want kids - never have, never will - and my boyfriend of 10 years feels the same. Family often tell me I’ll “change my mind” but I see it the same way as people who know they want kids eventually - you just know. I have been saving up money to pay to get sterilised and I still need to finish saving and then start the whole process which will probably take a while but I’m really excited. It will stop me getting pregnant and I can come off birth control for the sake of my mental health. 

People who know about this have asked me if I’m sure, what if I change my mind, and told me what a big decision it is. I know it’s a big decision but I don’t think it’s any bigger than the decision to have a child and it’s something I’ve been thinking about for years. 

Some of my friends have been really supportive and know how badly I want this operation so they have asked if they can throw me a “non-baby shower” to celebrate when I have had it done. I really appreciate the thought but I’m conscious of the fact there are people in the world who desperately want kids but can’t have them and whilst I obviously can’t relate I don’t want to upset anyone by celebrating essentially making myself infertile when there are people who that is a big problem for.

0,"AITA for not inviting my boyfriend along when I hang out with my friends | This has been an ongoing argument between my boyfriend (M26) and I (F26) so we're bringing it to the internet to decide whether I'm being an asshole. He's read over what I'm writing and we're both going to accept the decision of internet strangers. For the record we live together.

I have always believed that when I'm hanging out with friends I should make an effort to sometimes go alone. This refers both to when I'm hanging out one on one with a friend and when it's a small group of us (like 3-4 friends from high school). When it's a larger group I always invite him. My reasoning for this is:

1. Just because they want to hang out with me doesn't necessarily mean that they want to hang out with my boyfriend at that time (for the record they like him). I feel like there are things that they maybe wouldn't feel comfortable sharing if he was there. 

2. Sometimes I feel like by bringing him I'm ""rubbing in their face"" or reminding them that they aren't in a relationship, and I know that some of them are actively looking. Also I remember how it felt when I was in their place and even though I was happy for them that they were happy I was also a little bit jealous and felt left out.

3. I think that a lot of times people get into relationships and lose touch with their friends. I remember how much it bothered me when I felt like I was losing my friend to a relationship or when they would invite me out but I felt like a 3rd wheel. It's important to me to keep making an effort in my friendships and not give my friends the feeling that they're ""in addition to my boyfriend"".

4. I feel like sometimes inviting my boyfriend changes the vibe of hanging out, and while that's totally fine, sometimes I feel like my friends want to just hang out ""the high school friends"" or ""just girls"". I feel like I also sometimes want this specific vibe. I remember how much it bothered me when I thought that I was hanging out with a friend and I showed up to see that her boyfriend had come along too, even if I liked him I was a little bit sad that we wouldn't have our own time together.

Overall I love my boyfriend and things are great when he comes along, but I feel that it's important for me to sometimes prioritize just friend things. This came up again today because I mentioned that I was going to meet with a friend tomorrow and my boyfriend got pissed that I'm not inviting him yet again, and he thinks that I'm taking my friends into account more than him.

1,"AITA - scolded a man in his 80s for “losing” his wife. | This happened on Thursday in a shopping mall. I was in a department store and an old man in his 80s was looking confused and rattled. I’m a man in my 30’s, just so you can get an idea. This old man kept dropping stuff and was looking around for someone. 

It was extremely noticeable he was distressed so I approached him and asked if he was ok. He said “I can’t find (name)” who was his wife. This is kind of the way the convo went. 

Him: She was just here, she doesn’t usually go far away from me. 

Me: Slow down. Who is (name)? Wife, daughter, granddaughter? I can’t help if you don’t provide more details. 

H: My wife! She had on a blue sweater and black pants. She is very short and fragile. 

M: do you know the last place you saw her?

H: (getting agitated) NO! Where is she?? I said where is she? 

M: Sir, please calm down. I don’t know who she is and am trying to help you, but I can’t help you with you yelling and screaming.

At this point he keeps dropping things and I pick them up. Conversation continues as we start pacing around the store. It’s almost empty, and no employees in sight. 

H: She forgets where she is, she needs to be found. 

M: Which is exactly what I am attempting to do. 

We find her on the other end of the store sitting on a chair which made it hard to see over the clothing racks. She barely speaks and seems tired or confused. 

M: Hi, your husband was looking for you. Are you okay?
(Him and her talking and him asking why she walked away). 

M: Sir, you really need to be more careful. She seems like she is very confused. Please don’t lose her again, you might not be as lucky. 

H: you don’t know my wife.

0,"AITA for lying about how I got a prominent scar? | Obligatory 'on mobile' warning. 

So some backstory- I (19F) have a very obvious clusters of scars on my throat from an incident when I was younger. I normally do whatever I can to hide it (ie. wearing turtlenecks or lots of necklaces and chokers) but sometimes it's not possible or I forget about it.

Normally, people stare a bit but don't ask questions but occasionally, someone will ask what happened/ if I'm okay. I normally just give a kinda vague 'Oh I had a surgery when I was younger'-type answer and change the conversation and people will generally leave it. I don't really want to or feel I have to disclose to strangers what actually happened as it's none of their business imo.

The incident- I was at my friend's(21F) house and her granddad asked me what the scars were from. I told him my usual surgery answer and he didn't ask anymore questions. My friend didn't say anything at the time either. She does know what the scar is actually from as we've been friends for about six years. I forgot about it until last night, when I got a text where she was basically berating me for lying about it and saying I was being disrespectful to throat cancer survivors and I shouldn't be ashamed of what happened and it was dishonest and by lying about what the scars are from, I'm adding to the stigma that people with mental health problems are liars/ attention seekers and so on. I have /never/ said my scars were in anyway related to throat cancer or cancer of ANY kind so I honestly have no clue where that comment came from. 

I think I was probably an AH in my reply but I basically just told her to fuck off and that it's my choice and that it's easy for her to say that I shouldn't be ashamed when she's not in my situation. She's read my message and not replied.

But she has got me worrying about whether it is an AH move to lie about them. My boyfriend agrees with my initial opinion and says it's my choice at the end of the day but a few of my friends are on the fence. So, I'm just kinda wondering if my friend was right and if I am the AH for this?",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I bought a house without letting my SO see it beforehand? | My boyfriend of 3 years and I have recently started talking about getting a house together. He is getting back on his feet after a traumatic life event and is working to better himself, which may take him some time to recover. Because of this, we've agreed that the house would be in my name, as I have strong credit and make significantly more money than he does.

We both agree on the features we would want our house to have and location, so we're on the same page in that aspect.

He's had a rough past few years and needs out of his current living situation ASAP; his mother has put him in a hole financially and mentally, as she is very irresponsible and manipulative, and he is suffering the consequences for it. She is a major reason as to why he's been held back in life.

0,"AITA for insisting my son get sleep instead of do homework? | My 14 year old son’s gotten into the habit of staying up until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning doing his schoolwork. He has to wake up at 7:00am to get to school. I called his mom (we’re divorced and live separately) and expressed this concern, but she said she wasn’t worried. I told her he’d have to go to bed at a normal hour when he was staying here. She basically said if I could make that happen, more power to me. 

So I told our son it’s fine to stay up every once in a while to catch up if behind or in the middle of a big crunch, but that it couldn’t be a habit, and he needed to have the lights out by 12:00. 

He said that wasn’t possible, so I went through his work with him and helped him prioritize what was worth investing full effort in and what was ok to just do the minimum on. 

He wasn’t goofing off or managing his time poorly, he does his homework in the living room, we can see him working. His school assigns 4-5 hours of homework a night and it’s just not feasible. So we cut it down to 2 with smart prioritizing. 

Then he went back to his mom’s place. She called me furious, saying it’s good that our son has the discipline to apply himself fully to school, and that if his friends are staying up that late (they are, we talk to other parents) then there’s no reason he shouldn’t. 

I told her his health is paramount and he needs to sleep, especially at this age, so if she had another suggestion I was all ears. She said I was stunting his future potential and teaching him poor work habits and that I was an ass for suggesting it’s ever reasonable to give half effort to any schoolwork.

0,"AITA for passing out McDonald's toys instead of candy? | So for a little info, I collect McDonald's toys. I've had a few collections in the past that always get stolen so after my previous hat pin collection got stolen I gave up on collecting for a while.

I honestly don't remember what started it but I started collecting McDonald's toys, they're cheap, my kid loves picking one every time I go get some, they're fun, and I don't have to run all around town looking for them lol. 

Anyway, I had a big box of extras that was getting pretty overfilled and didn't really know what to do with the ones neither of us wanted (still in the plastic wrapper never opened or used) so I had the bright idea to leave them instead of a bowl of candy as a fun alternative. I was actually pretty excited about it. So I put it on the porch, wrote on the box, ""Please take one, Happy Halloween!"" And took my little one trick or treating. Came home to a mostly empty box (only six left over) and we all went to bed. 

This morning I delivered the remaining toys to my neighbor and her two children as I still didn't want the extras I already had and they were pretty happy. I sat back on my porch for a cigarette (I live pretty close to the mailboxes) and a couple were walking to the mailbox were talking about how they ""couldn't believe someone would pass out their old free McDonald's toys"" and saying how cheap and rude it was. I didn't say anything but I felt pretty embarrassed. Also, they aren't free if you get them without a happy meal they're a dollar a piece at the McDonald's by my house. They were never opened and all in the package. I honestly wish I would have said something but I can't help but feeling embarrassed still.

1,"Aita for wanting my girlfriend to have a bigger butt | Been with my girlfriend for about two years. She’s never had a big butt but lately I swear it’s been flatter. She pretty much has no curves at all and I don’t find it very attractive. 
I kinda upset her one time when we were getting intimate because I made a comment about how her butt has changed and how it’s basically not even a pancake at this point–more of a crepe ass if anything. Obviously I worded it differently, I just said that her butt doesn’t look how it used to and that I’d like it to be bigger. She got upset and now doesn’t want to be intimate anymore. She won’t show me her ass anymore and is hesitant to take her clothes off in front of me. I guess it made her feel insecure but I feel like I have a right to bring up my concern about physical attraction. Obviously it’s important. 
I suggested that she do squats and she doesn’t want to do it. I told her that I would do it with her if it made her happier and she said no, I also said I could change something to make her happier and she said she didn’t want to change anything. I don’t think I can really get her to change my mind but I don’t find her butt attractive. It’s pretty flat and squishy but I’d prefer a larger and firmer ass. I don’t think it’s worth breaking up over but it is kind of annoying. Aita for having preferences because she makes me feel like one because of how upset she gets over it. ",False,False
1,"AITA for not paying the bill at a restaurant and not tipping? | This happened a few years ago, but since right now I have nothing to do,I can’t stop thinking about it. 

A friend of mine wanted to go to a restaurant for his birthday and asked toto RSVP so that he could reserve a table. The restaurant hadn’t been open very long, but it already had a built in audience since it was part of a franchise. About 25 people answered. 

I am always the one that’s on time, which is early for everyone else, and that day was no exception. No one was there, not even my friend, but still, I told the hostess that I was part of the group, and she told me that they already had the table waiting, but I must wait for my friend. That was fine, he got there 10mins later. He approached the hostess to ask her to take us to the table, and she refused. She said that she could only sit ya if there was half of the people he had reserved there. We were shocked, we had never heard of such policy before, especially at a franchise spicy chicken wings place, and also we knew that our friends were not going to be there on time. 

We had to wait for an hour and a half on the sitting room. We saw how the place went from mildly busy to packed, and from the sitting room we could see our reserved table and how they never touched it. They just wouldn’t let us go in until half the people were there. 

At the moment I thought that it was because they didn’t want the waiter to get confused on our orders, but turns out that’s what he did later. 

Maybe having only 1 waiter for a 25 people table and have him still wait on his whole section wasn’t a good idea, but he still made a lot of mistakes. If we asked for water he brought Coke and when we tried to send it back, he told us that it was already in the system and he had to charge us for the water in addition since he couldn’t delete the coke. He did this with several items and people had to pay double for food they didn’t order. The bill was astronomically high at the end of the night, and there was food on the table that no one touched because we hadn’t ordered it. We asked to speak with the manager and he said that the waiter was right in how he had handled it, and there was no way to fix his mistakes. 

We only paid for the food we originally ordered and left. 

They tried to chase us down the street, but we were already on our cars and leaving.

I don't know her and I quickly get out of there and proceed to never talk to her again. 

Anyway, approximately 16 weeks later, it was almost forgotten about until a Facebook message came through from a name I didn't recognise. In the message, I'm told this person is pregnant and not only that but this child is mine. 

So I replied that I don't want anything to do with this child and that she should get an abortion. It's worth mentioning that she lives in a country abortion is illegal, however, I offered to fly her to a country the procedure is legal. She declined. It's worth mentioning here that I have also said that will pay any child maintenance fees, although, I have still made it clear that, aside from my financial responsibilities, I want nothing to do with this child. 

Most recently, she has asked me about ""my boy"" with the implication that I have a relationship with him. I told her that she chose to have a child, not me, and that you have to choose to be a father. I'm a sperm donor. She replied with just OK.

Backstory is my husband got a huge promotion at work and today is his first day. It’s a promotion that not only comes with a huge salary increase but pretty much cements his position in an upper management tract within this company. I also appreciate that him working so hard has allowed me to follow my passions and not just have a “job.” So I don’t want there to me any misunderstanding that I don’t appreciate what he does. 

He had plans yesterday to go golfing with the people in his new office, followed by a “mans man” steak dinner and cigars. So he was essentially going to be gone all day. At about noon my best friend called and said that she had gotten last minute passes into Tana Mongeau and Jake Paul's wedding in Vegas. I was like you have to be shitting me. She asked if I could go, I said that my husband was out all day and since Vegas is only 6 hours...why not. 

We hit the road and had literally the time of my life. We got to see the fake fight, I got to meet Armani, we met a ton of people we knew from IG, danced all night, it was such a great time and we didn’t leave the club until well after 6am. We crashed at an a guys room we met at the club and I’m just now coming to life (it’s 9:45) and need to get on the road home. 

I forgot to charge my phone so it died sometime around 11 last night and I woke up to a crazy amount of angry messages and texts from my husband. All amounted to “uhhh maybe it’s not a good idea to drive to Vegas and let me find out from Instagram?” And bitchy stuff like that and then finally “did you forget your promise to meet me at work for breakfast with my bosses this morning?” (Which yes, I did) but I hated the tone of it all. 

To me he was gone all day, i had an invite to a once in a lifetime event, how can he possibly expect me NOT to go? Yes I forgot something important to Him but he forgets stuff too so NBD, or at least NBD after I apologize but no reason to blow up my shit with angry texts.

My brother Sean has been dating Ashley for 2 years, and they got engaged about two months ago.  

Ashley has always been very kind to me and my family.  But she isn’t close with her blood siblings.  And by not close I mean like... she hasn’t talked to them in years.  Not a single word.

&#x200B;

Quick backstory on the clickbaity title: I (f/31) have a brother (30) and, surprise, two parents. My family has never been close, even as a kid. While we never lacked anything (food, clothing, schooling), my parents were a bit abusive growing up, so establishing a positive emotional connection was difficult. I moved out when I was 18, never visited much. We keep in touch as in talk on the phone every few weeks and see each other about once a year. I call on their birthdays, they call on mine. I don't keep in touch with my brother at all as we have zero stuff in common. I text on his birthday, he usually forgets mine. That's our relationship. That all worked fine up until about four months ago.

&#x200B;

In December, I got engaged to my gf of five years. My parents know and like this girl. I texted them a picture of the ring, they said congrats, all good. In March, we sent out the save the dates, including one to my parents. In our next phone call after receiving it, they asked whether my brother was also invited. I said no, as we are keeping it to a minimum (30 people including us) and since my brother and I don't talk at all, he doesn't fall in that category. They said hm, ok and that was it. Or so I thought.

&#x200B;

Four days later, my mother calls me. She basically yelled and cursed at me for 15 minutes, telling me how much I suck for not inviting my brother, that I'm ruining the family, bla bla and that she won't be attending. I didn't really get to say anything and when she was done, I just sarcastically said ""well, if you're not coming that saves us some money"". This is pretty much me to the core, so a sarcastic snark from my side shouldn't have surprised her. Well apparently it did and she just hung up. This was my last conversation with her.

&#x200B;

Now to the WIBTA part. All of my family's birthdays are in June. I texted my father on his (we briefly spoke on the phone afterwards, nothing relevant), texted my brother on his (a two line conversation as usual) and now my mother's is coming up and I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I do feel it's a bit petty to just ignore her birthday, on the other hand, she said some awful things to me, apparently expects ME to apologize (according to my father) and I really don't want to be the person to break the silence even though she fucked up. My gf agrees with me, however I've seen some pretty insightful responses on this sub so I thought I'd also give it a shot.

0,"AITA for refusing to believe that my dog tried to attack someone? | Basically what the title says. 

My dog Cerberus is a bit of a mutt. He was a rescue and was found as a stray so we're not entirely sure *what* he is, but judging by his size and the shape of his head, there's some Doberman in him somewhere. He's a big, big guy and I get that he looks a bit intimidating and hell-houndish (hence why I named him Cerberus) but he's honestly the chillest dog I've ever met. He only really gets excitable at playtime; other than that he's a lazy sod and is incredibly content to just lie down in his favourite spot for literal *hours* and only get up for food. 

The issue at hand happened yesterday. I had a small gathering at my house. Not so much a party, but just a handful of friends over to play board games, eat food and drink wine. One of the people in attendance was my friend's new girlfriend of ~2months. She hadn't been to my place yet and hadn't met Cerberus. According to my friend, she'd given no indication prior that she was nervous of dogs but as soon as she arrived at mine she became visibly on edge. I asked what was up and she (quite rudely) said ""Nobody mentioned there was gonna be a *massive* dog here."" I kinda laughed and said ""Oh yeah but don't worry he probably won't move all evening."" She asked if he could be put outside or something because she'd been ""almost bitten"" (her words) by a Doberman as a child and was frightened of him. I said no to putting him outside because it was chilly and that's not fair, but did concede to put him in the kitchen while we played games. I thought that was the end of it, but the GF later got up to go to the toilet, which meant she had to cross through the kitchen. While in the kitchen she began screaming and freaking out. We naturally rushed through and she said that Cerberus had gotten up and came over and ""made to attack her"". I argued this wasn't the case, he'd simply gotten up and come over because he was curious who was in the room. She insisted it was terrifying and I kept arguing that I *know* my dog, he's never bitten anyone in the four years I've had him and he's not vicious. She kept saying ""any dog can turn"", which I agreed to, but maintain that he hadn't and wouldn't. She and my friend eventually left. She's maintaining that he tried to bite her and made her ""afraid for her life"" and that he should've been put outside. I'm maintaining that if he'd acted as viciously as she's saying we'd have heard barking or growling or something, and we didn't, alongside the fact that he is categorically not an aggressive dog.

I feel like I can't get anytime alone with her when she isn't stoned, the house always smells like weed, I've found resin and dabs stuck to things around the house. So, the other day, I'd had enough. And I asked her if she could stop smoking only on our days off together (Usually just a day a week, maybe more if her schedule is tweaked at work).

She says that smoking helped her with her anxiety and depression issues. Now, I know she's struggled with this stuff, and was attending therapy and on medication a few years ago for this same reason, until she lost her health insurance. I suggested that she return to therapy, where we have great insurance since I started a new job a while back, to help treat these symptoms. That went over horribly, she told me she's ""not crazy"", and doesn't want to attend therapy or get put on medication again. She says that the side-effects of marijuana aren't nearly as bad as the medication she was on.

Now we haven't really been talking, more just quick ""What do you want from the store?"" kind of things. It's been about a week and a half, and things are tense between us. Divorce has been thrown around. Some of her friends have told me that I need to step down from this whole thing, saying that ""She's an entirely new person since she started using marijuana"".  Personally, I don't feel like I'm asking a whole lot, just a day or two a week where she doesn't smoke. And I see it as, if she's experiencing medical problems, she should seek professional help. But there's a lot of self doubt now, so here I am. AITA?

0,"AITA for not wanting to forgive my brother for years of mistreatment? | I (18f) have an older brother (23m) and our relationship is extremely rocky. He dropped out after about a year and a half of JuCo and didn’t tell anyone. Which, while I don’t judge him for dropping out, I have a big issue with him keeping it from everyone.

l have an issue because while he was dropped out and lying, both my parents had surgery. (Summer of 2019). So, most of the housework fell on me. The biggest one was taking care of my other brother (20m) who has autism. All while I was starting my first semester at college (thankfully I still live at home while at uni). It was a tough time. Since my brother was lying about school, he would leave the house early in the morning (6am) and wouldn’t be back till late (9-10pm, when my brother and parents are already asleep).

I was already frustrated with doing everything on my own, but at that point, I didn’t know he was lying. I was more upset that he wasn’t appreciative of me at all, and seemingly didn’t give a shit about my parents, especially my mom, who went through a very invasive and painful surgery. He also was always around the house with an extremely bad attitude, snapping at me, barely even speaking to me and basically treating me like a nuisance, like he was a teenager again.

This treatment and pushing of responsibilities onto me is nothing new. Growing up, when my parents left for a weekend, he would “watch” my brother and I, but he would completely ignore us or talk to us as if we were the most annoying people on the planet. Didn’t do wonders for my self esteem and, once again, I took care of my other brother on my own. The treatment never left.

After he finally came clean about dropping out, he also said he was struggling with depression and didn’t want to tell anyone, because “nobody would understand”. I was upset by this, since both my parents have PTSD, and my mother and I struggle with anxiety and depression. Our family has been through a lot and we’re very open. While I don’t fault him for being scared to talk about these things, I get upset when he acts as though he is the only one struggling, and thus has an excuse to be rude and mean to us. Like he’s using his depression as an excuse to not help around the house and just be a mean person to us.

Recently, he did something stupid and almost lost his girlfriend. I’m not sure, but I guess it flipped a switch in him and he’s been acting way nicer and doing nice things. He actually talks to my brother and I like people and is being honest.

I feel like it’s too late for us. I’ve never felt like he’s loved me as a sister and never treated me with respect. I don’t feel like I need to forgive him. But then I feel guilty because I’m sure his therapist is why he’s turning over a new leaf like this. I feel like if I don't open up, I’ll be stifling his growth. But it’s hard after years of mistreatment.

0,"AITA for leaving my friend's birthday party because I felt the dancers behaved inappropriately? | On Saturday night my friend and her boyfriend had a joint birthday party. I didn't know they hired dancers until the lights were dimmed and the people were literally walking inside. It's not really my thing these days but I thought it would be rude to leave, so I took a seat and watched as a male and female dancer gave them each a lap dance as they sat back to back. It got pretty rowdy, lots of whistles, yelling, etc. Eventually the dancers began working the room, dancing with other people, going back to my friend and her BF, etc.

  
Out of nowhere the woman dancer came to me, took my hand, pulled me to my friend and basically began involving me in a lap dance. That caught a lot of people's attention and there was a big response (phones out, yelling things, you get the idea). I went along with it for a bit but stuck to light grinding, similar to how I'd dance at a club/party. Then my friend stood up and they pushed me down onto the chair, the dancer put her hands on my knees and forced them apart, which got a bunch of people all riled up again. I shook my head and said, ""no, no, no..."" but I was also laughing which might have sent a mixed message. When the guy joined in I felt things really crossed the line. He put his leg up, foot on the arm of the chair, and was thrusting his groin extremely close to my face. His genitals were covered but very little was left to the imagination (and it was clear he was enjoying himself if you catch my drift). During his ""dance"" the woman was behind me, running her hands over my shoulders, down my chest and grazing my side-boob. Thankfully a sober friend pulled/danced me away and I left the house immediately.

  
Apparently the party died shortly after, they tried dancing with other people and everyone outright refused. The dancers also asked my friend's friend (the person who hired them) to tip them on my behalf (???). The woman dancer also offered a few people cocaine. I heard about this from a friend who checked in on me after she left the party that night.

  
On Sunday I received texts from my friend's friend and a mutual friend both essentially accusing me of being rude and ruining the 'spirit' of the party. My friend's friend even asked why I came if I don't like parties. I was at a loss for words. I've been to lots of parties. I worked in the hospitality/nightlife industry for three years. I've been to strip clubs and bachelor/bachelorette parties with actual strippers; never in my life have I experienced anything like what I did there. Professional entertainers don't behave that way in my experience. I'm not close with my friend's friend (she's an acquaintance at best) but my other friend is a reasonable person, she's a teacher and fairly 'normal' all around. I've always thought highly of her and respected her opinions. Now I'm wondering if what I did was actually asshole behavior?",False,False

I followed. She then proceeded to show me some college flyers where she wanted me to apply. I asked her to stop. I told her I'm not interested in going to college. I'm too old for that now. Plus I'm okay with my job and content. She then proceeded to give this long story about her struggle and how she managed college and 3 kids and all that stuff. She told me that all she wanted is to see her only son successful. And I made her feel as a failure. I just stood and asked to just mind her own business and to take pride in her two successful daughters if I'm a looser. After that i left the kitchen. A couple hours later i silently left.

0,"WIBTA if i didn't let my girlfriend be named on the mortgage? | (Throwaway account)

I (25 M) and my girlfriend (25 F) have been together for around 4 years now. We have been living together renting out a place for 3 years now and everything has gone amazingly. We have a really strong relationship together and are looking at getting a mortgage. We are getting to the point in our relationship where we are thinking about taking our relationship to the next level with marriage, kids etc. 

I have a very well-paying job for my age in the UK (around £45K a year which can rise to easy £80K+). My girlfriend not so much, with salary of around £22K a year with not much progression. Whilst renting, I have always paid substantially more, but have never had a problem doing this due to the obvious gap in salary, and also, if anything ever went wrong in our relationship, I wouldn't lose out financially.

Anyway, I mentioned to my Dad how we are looking to get a mortgage together soon. He told me to not get a mortgage with her unless we both paid 50/50 down the middle. I told him this was not possible due to her salary and he told me to pay the full mortgage each month and take ""rent"" from my girlfriend to whatever she could afford. I asked why? So he explained how if she was named on the mortgage but only paid say £200 a month and i paid £800,  if we ever broke up, the mortgage would be split down the middle, leading to me losing out on a hell of a lot of money due to us being common law husband and wife after 2 years of living together.

I know in the past this happened to him with my Mother, and he has told me of friends that this has happened to. He said at the end of the day, it is my decision, but he was offering only a word of warning that he wishes I never have to experience.

I mentioned what my Dad told me to my girlfriend, and she said how she wouldn't be willing to do that, as if I was the only name on the mortgage and we split, I would keep all the money she has contributed to the mortgage. I understand where she is coming from, but I don't want to be financially stung in case our relationship ever goes sour.

0,"AITA for Escalating Against Friend Who Didn't Pay Me | My friend, call her Fay, worked a lowlevel corporate job for a huge company. Fay knew I was good at photography (casual) and had asked me to shoot for a corporate party before. It took a while to get paid but went well.

Fay asked if I wanted to shoot for a 2 day corporate event. I would receive $25 ph and another goodie bag, same rate. I said yes as the last event was fun. I asked my boyfriend, call him Joe, to help. We'd split the cash, be reimbursed for travel, and were each promised a goodie bag. 

The event was awful. We worked 24 hours in 2 days. We were expected to have edited photos from the 1st day (ending 10pm) by the 2nd day (starting 6:30am). Joe left halfway through the 2nd day because the stress of the event set off a panic attack. We edited about a 1000 photos and sent them to Fay.

A couple months passed, I tried to contact Fay several times to hang out and ask about payment. Joe and I had spent $170 on Ubers, with Fay's approval. After a while, I called her out on ghosting me. She then
 told me a guy in accounting messed up, she didn't go through proper channels to hire us, that there was no money in the budget for us, and that her boss told her to just not pay us.

She owned up that it was mostly her fault not going through proper channels and wanted to pay us back herself. I decided that she should just pay me back for the Ubers, as we all were financially struggling. I thought it reasonable to compensate only money we lost. 

I reached out to Fay several times after that, trying to set up payment. She always stated that she was struggling finanically but would keep us updated and would send me money. I agreed to give her time. I went back to my home town with Joe for a long visit. Four months later, no word. 

Yesterday, I sent to her work email an invoice and letter of demand. I stated she had 2 months to pay me back for the Ubers and if any of our photos were used, I wanted full compensation for hours worked ($700). If an agreement was not reached, I may escalate further (contact bosses, Fair Work, and possibly take it to small claims). 

She was furious that I emailed her ""threatening to sue"" her and how I was a terrible friend for not considering her financial crisis. She called me out on how the ramifications of this would hurt her more than it would hurt me (she could lose her job vs. I could lose the money). I should be ""thankful"" for the opportunity she gave me to work with such a high profile company. 

 She works where min. wage is $18 ph, I know she makes more. I work 3 jobs in my home town to save money. Min. wage is $8. She constantly posts instas at bars/restaurants.

I’m not a dog guy, I don’t hate it and I’ll take care of it if she asks me to but otherwise it’s primarily her responsibility, and this was agreed upon when we moved in together.

Currently I make two-thirds of the household income. The dog was recently diagnosed with a terminal illness and is going to die within a year of diagnosis (6 months left). Treatments are delaying its death and easing its suffering, but is completely draining our finances. Up until now I’ve been paying to help treat it but we don’t take in that much money and it’s been eating into my life savings...savings I wanted to buy a house with her with.

She’s said they’re not just for others to follow, but just as a reminder to herself. It’s ridiculous. 

These rules are like; don’t sit down anywhere without telling where. Wash your hands after coming inside. Wash your hands after eating before touching anything. Don’t sit down anywhere without permission, etc etc. It’s really annoying.

Of course I always tend to forget about the rule pages around, I’m used to them there so I pay no mind. Because of this I had forgotten some of the rules, and sat down on the couch (which had her clean laundry on it so I just moved it to the side)  while she was in the bathroom.

Needless to say, she was panicked when she saw. Apparently she didn’t know if my hands were safe or not, and since I had moved her laundry it is now “infected” and “unsafe” which gave her a TOTAL breakdown.

0,"AITA for not looking after my landlord's dog when I always used to? | Landlord has a dog, we love her. We used to look after her a lot as they go on numerous vacations a year. We train her, she’s smart and picks up behaviours well. When she goes home it isn't carried on and when we have her again we work on it (waiting when we put her bowl down etc.), we also clean her water and food bowls as they’re often mouldy.

A few months back I asked if it would be okay for us to get a dog of our own, we look after theirs and they trust us. We live on farmland with lots of space. They said no as a dog may scratch our floor, the wife told me a week later she has not got enough time for her dog, she is trying to get a project off the ground and they worry if we got a dog it would bark, and set their dog off and that would impact her work. They shut the dog in a room of their house which makes her bark more than usual.

Shortly after they approached me when my fiancé wasn’t home, they offered me their dog on a timeshare. I felt they were trying to take advantage of me as we’d expressed a wish for a dog of our own. They wanted us to have their dog when they're away and I walk her for them as then we get “the joy” of having a dog without responsibility. Their dog gets confused when she isn’t staying with us, as they yell at her when she tries to come and see us, we live open plan so when she is outside she is free to approach us. We really wanted a dog of our own and not to share someone else's, mainly as it does confuse her.

I got several messages after asking me at very short notice (an hour before) to have their dog, I had to say no as we weren’t home or were not available. I offered to bring their dog to wherever we were going but they were quite rude in their replies if I said I couldn't. We are now not allowed to pet their dog when she comes to our side of the fence.

They have asked if we would take their dog for a week as they have a lot of work, I declined. We could have her but I feel out of principle they shouldn't just get free dog-care from me when I'm also working at home. I said it would not be any more beneficial for the dog, I suggested I could collect her and take her on an evening walk with me. They recently got chickens and it seems that this has further impacted the level of care for the dog, I thought this would be a good opportunity for them to tend to the chickens uninterrupted. I received a rude response telling me not to bother and basically a “thanks for not helping us”.

Ever since, they’re blanking us. Their dog came to see us today and the wife screamed at her and said “GET AWAY FROM THEM”, I said “oh don’t worry we are happy to say hello!” and the wife muttered under her breath 'only when it suits you'.

One of my coworkers told me his friend is looking for a roommate to move into his empty room, he's a nice quiet guy, seems easy to live with. He put us in touch and we got along alright, and he gave me a subletting lease to sign.

I was just about to sign it when my friend from college texted me a picture of a Craigslist apartment listing, asking ""is this the guy you're moving in with?""

It was obviously posted by him, it was for the same house. And it skeeved me out. In the write-up he said ""women only"" and that he was looking to be housemates with ""either a college student or young professional with a compatible lifestyle"" 

And then he wrote a lot about himself, in a way that made it sound like a dating profile. I don't want to quote it all because of anonymity, but he talked about how he's nice and chivalrous and courteous, and he wants to ""cultivate a homey atmosphere"" 

Anyway it read more like he was looking for a girlfriend than a roommate, I texted him right away saying that I saw his Craigslist posting and I was sorry but I didn't think we'd work as roommates.

He asked why, and I said that I noticed he was looking for women his age only, was looking for a close personality fit, and that his post read as too personal for me. I'm looking for a roommate situation where we mind our own business and aren't too personal.

My full reason was that it skeeved me out he was looking for young women only, it felt like he expected more than a roommate. But I was trying to be a little more polite than that because I know he's a friend of a coworker and I didn't want problems at work.

Anyway, he got mad, said he needed a roommate soon and that he'd stopped considering other options for a month and a half because I was planning on signing a sublet. But now he was stuck paying twice the rent the next month and the coming months.

I suggested maybe he post a less restrictive ad if he was looking for a roommate quickly.

1,"WIBTA for not locking up my dog for my brother's girlfriend? | Hello, 

Not much background information for this, so I'll cut to the chase.

My brother's new girlfriend will be joining us for the first time for our monthly game night. No biggie, except she is afraid of my dog.  I have a pitbull who is the sweetest, biggest baby. I love my pup and consider him part of the family. No one has ever had a problem with him...until now. 

Game night is Friday night, my bro called me today to ask me to please keep Murphy in a room so he can't roam free because his girlfriend is afraid of big dogs, especially pits. I told him I needed to think about it, but also that I don't want to do it because it's 1) my house and 2) my dog lives here, not her. I think she should just suck it up and stop being ridiculous, the dog isn't vicious. 

Anyway, I'm worried that this is going to cause a rift in my relationship with my brother, but at the same time Murph is my baby and if you don't accept him, then you don't accept me. He thinks I am being dramatic because it's just for one night, but I think that if I set this precedence, she's just going to expect my dog to always be locked away, even on days that aren't game nights (I have parties at my house often, cookouts, things like that).  He also said he might not come to gamenight, and that I'm putting him in an awkward position.

So WIBTA if I don't keep my dog separated?",False,False
1,"AITA for joking about my older sister still reading children's books? | Hii, I've made an alt account especially to post this because my older sister uses Reddit and knows my regular account. I'm 19f and she is 27f.

&#x200B;

We've both been readers for basically our entire lives and used to share books and pretty much always read the same books. She'd also read to me when I was young. Overall we had a pretty great relationship and had the same interests and favourite genres; mostly fantasy.

&#x200B;

My sister has always preferred reading young adult books, which are books with a target audience for kids aged 12-17. In my opinion, they are children's books, but my sister doesn't think so. For most of her life now she's pretty much exclusively read young adult, whereas I moved onto adult books at age like 16 lol. For those who don't know what young adult is, these are some examples; Twilight, Hunger Games, Throne of Glass, The Mortal Instruments, The Vampire Diaries, Six of Crows, Red Queen, etc. There are plenty of people who enjoy young adult, but I still think you should move onto adult books when you reach a certain age.. but that's just me. My sister will often say there are women in their forties in her book club reading young adult and I find that strange.

&#x200B;

So we all went out for dinner last night and as we were talking about what new books we'd both read, I told her she should try and move onto adult books and recommended a few to her she'd enjoy. She explained she just gets bored easily with adult books and wants to stick to young adult, and I called her a child in a JOKEY way and said she should grow up and move onto real stories. I'm not saying young adult isn't real but like, they're definitely not as in depth as Wheel of Time for example. She got mad, but didn't really dwell on it, parents said I was being really rude and I should just let her enjoy what she wants to. We had a tiny argument where I tried explaining where I'm coming from, but sister told me to shut up and refused to listen to what I had to say, even though I was gonna make good points. 

&#x200B;

My sister isn't that angry with me, she kinda just laughed it off but my parents called me an elitist and said they didn't bring me up that way, and my dad (he is who we get our love of reading from) says everyone can read whatever they want to and I should stay out of it. I tried explaining to him how childish young adult books are, and he essentially called me an asshole.

1,"AITA for not going to church with my gf after her dad died? | So neither me or my gf are very religious. I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.

Her dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about ""traditions"" and now she's crying and sulking.

0,"WIBTA for telling my roommate to remove his belongings from the room I pay for? | I live in a 3 bedroom (2 upstairs, 1 downstairs) house with 2 room mates, one of which is my partner. I was the last roomie to move in when their previous friend moved out. When i came into the house i assumed all of the old room mates bills for internet, utilities, rent, etc. Our room mate (T) lives in one of the bedrooms upstairs and my partner and I sleep in the bedroom downstairs together, and I have kept the other room upstairs (that is technically the room that I am renting) as mostly a sensory/decompression/meditation/reading/crafting space that doubles as a guest bedroom for when friends come over. It doesn't have a lot of things in it, just a mattress and some personal items of mine that I use when it's time for some ""me"" time. T is a bit of a hoarder and has stuff overflowing from his bedroom (upstairs) into the hallway, lining his living room space, stuffing his cabinet space, the garage etc. I don't mind the clutter as he keeps it organized and keeps it in his own spaces.

I had fallen into a depressive state the last few months and had not been using the room much because i had lacked the motivation to do the things I enjoy.

Upon going upstairs I saw that T has started moving his crafting supplies into the room, completely lining one of the walls and making the room smell of leather, dye and other unpleasant chemicals. I was never told, asked or even aware that he had started doing this or when exactly it occurred. His crafting supplies also fill the garage, upstairs hallway and most of his own personal space. It had even been brought up in the past when he asked a few months ago what we plan on using the room for and suggested a crafting room and he was told sorry, no, it would be a personal decompression space.

I am a person that takes my coziness very seriously and I can not use the room for its purposes when I can barely breathe when I walk into the room, so just pretending it isn't there is not going to work for me unfortunately. The room may not have been used much over the last several weeks, but I do not believe that makes it free storage space. Luckily, I am also on the tail end of this depressive cycle and can see the room being in use in the very near future for my own projects. I am at the point of telling him to remove his belongings or be prepared to pay for that space's rent as well (i wouldn't put my portion of rent on him just for the room, but I think he absolutely should be paying more rent for using more space.) I have been forgiving about the space he and his belongings take up until this point, but I think I have reached my limit on this one. I do not know if he took it upon himself to move his things in there or if he asked my partner who said he could (still waiting on an answer before I tell T to remove his things) but I don't think that really matters, if he was told yes it was a miscommunication and the situation still needs to be rectified.

T needs to move his stuff, or he needs to pay more rent. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for hitting cones a lady set up in her driveway? | So here’s the set up:


My street is VERY tiny but also has street parking. Due to the street parking, only one car can go at a time. Turning around is a BITCH. 


A few of the neighbors have a driveway, including the neighbor directly across from me. I do not have a driveway. It’s just a dirt path that has to stay clear because it leads to a back side street. Sorry if this is confusing but we live in a historic district with very awkward layouts. 


Anyway, every day when I have to leave for work, I pull in to my dirt path and back out. When I back out, the tail end of my car goes in to my neighbors driveway


NOTE: I have never driven on their grass or yard—strictly the edge of their driveway. I don’t even go in, just enough to back my car up a bit to turn around.



Recently, my neighbor put up cones in her driveway every morning. They are gone by the time I get home from work. To me, this was incredibly petty. Like, i can’t use the EDGE of your driveway to back up? I’m not parking there, going in your yard, or blocking anyone in. I’m just turning around to go to work. 



So I started hitting the cones. Just a little bump because I barely need that much space to turn around but if they are in my way and get a little bump, oh well. Doesn’t hurt my car.



Now my neighbor has told on me to my landlord. My landlord thinks she’s a crazy bitch but gave me a heads up just in case I want to keep the peace with her. He doesn’t care what I do.

1,"AITA for being upset my boyfriend went running in a thunderstorm? | So this is about my boyfriend, been together a few years and live together. relationship is solid and we're on board with getting married sometime soon.

So I've always been a runner, I do a few 5ks a week depending on free time (we both work full time). He usually plays sports to stay healthy, soccer and volleyball at community fields. Recently he decided he wants to run a half marathon and started running with me. Great! I figure why not do one myself, so we started running every day.

The thing is he has no sense of limits. So last night it was thunder storming and he asked me if I wanted to running with him in 30 minutes in the middle of the thunderstorm. I raised an eyebrow at him and said sure, but it was sarcastic!! How could he not know that I was being sarcastic. So 30 minutes later he's in his t shirt and shorts (it's also 40F outside) and running shoes and asks if I'm ready from the other room. I tell him I wasn't being serious about running, and has he looked at the weather outside. He frowns and says it's fine, he'll just go running by himself.

I suddenly get scared because I don't want him to get hurt or sick so I run to the door and block it. This starts an argument (which is relatively rare in the relationship) where he says it's fine and other people do it and that him and his friends play soccer in the rain all the time. But I point out that it's pouring now and thunderstorming and he just doesn't see the difference. Eventually I get frustrated and just let him go running but make him promise to be back within 15 minutes. He agrees.

It takes him over 20 minutes to get back. He said he didn't realize how much the rain would slow him down and he didn't bring his phone so he couldn't check the time. I tell him he's not allowed to run in thunderstorms ever again (rain is still fine). He thinks I'm being unreasonable. AITA for making this rule?",False,False
0,"AITA for choosing side of another woman, instead of a cheated wife? | I had a roommate for 3 years. In those 3 years we never became close friends, but as a roommate she was awesome. Pleasent to be around, clean, tidy, quiet,  etc. There were a few instances where her selfless actions melted my heart (mostly regarding my pets) and she never mentioned it. 


I knew that she had a boyfriend, I met him. He was older, good looking guy, who seemed to be very happy with her. Sometimes they would fight, sometimes I wouldn't see him for weeks, sometimes she wouldn't get out of bed for days etc. As I said, he was happy, sometimes she was happy too. But when he would come, he was very sweet and caring. He would help her with housework (she hated ironing so he would do that), made some food for her etc. They would go on trips together, sometimes they worked together... It is hard to sum up 3 years, but it was real. 


Eventually, he stopped coming and she moved to a new city after her lease was up 


We don't live in a small city, but this is a small world. I guess, his wife knew who was my roommate as she also knew who I was, where I live, which dogs I have, and which car I drive.

She approached me in a big group of women and it took me like an hour to figure out what is going on. She seems to be nice, but in a very  ingenuine way which is hard to explain. She never raised her voice, but she asked me 5 times how was living with a fucking whore. She told me that my roommate was only good for fuck, that those women don't have a class, will never be happy, have mental, and daddy issues. She told me that her husband was with her only for an hour a week so he can get off, that she was a prostitute who didn't get paid, that it meant nothing, that she is ugly, bony girl who will be forever alone.


Honestly, I forgot half of it by now, but I was in shock. The woman wasn't drunk, it was like 9 am and she looked normal.

As i have had enough and I was starting to see red, I tried to leave, but she blocked my way and asked me to confirm her story which I didn't. I did the opposite. I mostly summed up what I have written here. Her face was paler and paler and by that point it was too late to take back what I just said. She didn't say anything back.

I ate with my mom lunch after this and she told me I was 100% heartless and wrong. A few from my friends who met my roommate told me that they would probably do the same as she crossed the line. My roommate is gone for 6 months now, so it's not like the woman just found out about this.

0,"AITA for filing multiple noise complaints on my neighbor because of the yelling of their intellectually disabled child? | I just recently upgraded from apartment living to a three bedroom duplex with my two children, wife and I. We have lived in apartments our entire adult lives.  Top floor, bottom floor, u name it, and we are used to and understanding of the noise. 

Moving to a duplex was a large step up for us. Each kid has their own room now! We have a garage! A backyard! We can grill! Also, it costs way more in rent then we have ever spent. But it seemed worth it, better school district and all that. 

Then real life set in and it hit hard. It’s almost like clock work, every night around 8-8:30ish the pounding and screaming starts. And it continued every night past 10:00 for quite awhile. 

About two weeks in it became ridiculous. My children were having a hard time falling asleep and it would go late enough that even my wife and I would have trouble going to sleep. One night it was exceptionally bad and my wife and I had had it! I knocked politely and the dad answered. 

I calmly explained to him that the noise was really loud, and that I wanted to have open communication with him because I’m sure they hear my kids at times too. He responded by saying, no, they never hear us and admitted it was all them. Then stated that one of their four children had autism and then nonchalantly jotted down my phone number and texted me for future use. 

Since then we haven’t heard anything past 10pm, (quiet hours are 10pm-8am) but every night there is pounding and screaming, every god damn night! And every god damn night my children have difficulty falling asleep! 

Since then we have filed multiple complaints with our rental agency, showing videos of even, of how loud it is and they don’t seem to care. They have done absolutely nothing. It’s so bad we are wanting to break our lease a month and a half in so we can, once again, have peace. 

Tonight it was a bit worse than usual and I texted the dad to ask if he would consider moving the loud child to a room that doesnt share a wall. I havnt heard back and I don’t expect to. 

But I can’t stop wondering.....

1,"AITA for falling out of love with my fiancé and cancelling the wedding? | Posting from a throwaway. 

Probably should add some background info before I just say ""hey I'm the c-word that dumped her loving fiancé!"" but even that may not make me any less AH. I'm looking for honest judgement as I think it might help me in my next relationship. 

I'd been dating ""Lenny"" since sophomore year in college. Regardless of what's happened, he is a great guy; he's great looking, great job in finance, amazing with kids, steady while being a lot of fun. We never really fought and when we did I felt we resolved our issues in a pretty even handed manner. I thought I really loved him. He proposed over Easter weekend last year and we were well into wedding planning for this summer. 

We took a trip to Hawaii over his Christmas holiday vacation and we were having a great time. I have no idea why but there was an interaction he had with a waiter where Lenny just seemed like such a weakling, it's hard to explain why it bothered me so much but it was like and instantaneous wave over my body that said ""I really don't love him."" I faked it through the next 5 days of the vacation but after getting settled in a home I very flatly told him I no longer loved him and I did not want to get married. I do feel bad but it looked like he'd been shot. 

We went through all he standard breakup stuff of him wanting an explanation, wanting to get back together, go to counseling, etc... I did not want any of this stuff. In the background pretty much everyone from our common friends to my own parents and siblings think I'm some sort of awful witch who has started taking drugs. No one will listen that I just don't love him anymore. The worst part about this is that I feel very isolated from everyone I thought I could trust. 


I have started dating quite a bit and Lenny thinks this is probably proof that I was cheating on him which isn't true at all but since his word is gold and mine is dog shit at this point, it's further poisoned the well with my friends and family.

0,"AITA for not changing my ceremony time for my grandma | I (27 F) got engaged late December 2019. My grandma had called me and asked that I not book my wedding between a couple dates - one early 2020 and one end of July 2020. I told her I don’t think I’ll be planning it for either of those times. 

Side note: my mother told me to not worry about planning around my grandma. That I should have my wedding whenever it suits me. But I do want my grandma at my wedding. 

Fast forward to last week. We have viewed several venues, most of which are booked up in 2020 and even some into 2021. We found a place I love and decided on August 1st date. The had a couple other openings in August but this date would not conflict with some unknown travel dates of my fiancé. 

Today my grandma called saying how sad she was that we booked August 1st, as that is the date they will be porting from their cruise. She didn’t say what time, but she looked at flights and was worried she would not make it to the ceremony. 

Per the venue, a typical ceremony is around 5:30-6pm. The flight my grandma found would arrive around 4:30, and takes maybe an hour to get to the venue from airport. 

She asked me to move my ceremony start time back to 6:30. I didn’t outright say no, but I think that’s too late for a ceremony to start. 

I asked her about canceling her cruise. (Note she goes on several cruises every year). She told me it’s a “once in a lifetime” trip and she didn’t want to miss it since she’s getting old. I kindly told her that my wedding is also once in a lifetime and that if she couldn’t find a suitable flight, she would have to choose. I even offered to help her find flights. The flights are limited, I’ll admit. And not knowing what time her cruise boards, it’s hard to help. There was one flight that would work, but it would be tight timing.

I feel awful for choosing a wedding date that conflicts with her plans, but we were limited on dates/venues. She also told me not to do the wedding at the end of July. I don’t remember if she gave me exact dates.

I grew up in a household where my mother was the strong parent while my father never seemed to be interested enough in my sister's upbringing and mine. My father still gathered all the benefits of being the pater familias he wasn't, with my mother even assuming most of the expenses even though his income was far higher than hers.

I cannot for the life of me recollect any memories involving him. All I could think of is how he would invite his friends home and my mother making sure she was being a welcoming host, the time he went to pick me up at the school I left 4 years beforehand and me knocking on his door to serve him his lunch in his personnal room.

My parents ended up divorcing after he asked for my mother's permission to take as a second wife one of his students from the university he teaches at (polygamy is legal where I'm from but it's an almost extinct practice that only rednecks ever consider). After horrible episodes of divorce drama (which haven't ended nine years later) he ended up selling half of our property to my mother and gave the other half to me and my sister.

I need your verdict. Most of my friends say it wasn't such a big deal, but my boyfriend is really angry.  
For starters I need to say English is not my native language so sorry for any mistakes.

I have been dating my boyfriend for a few months now. We used to be just roommates, so we've known each other for a lot longer. He really is the sweetest guy even though he used to be a player.  
These last few months he has been working a lot so I have been cooking dinner for him every day. He says he really like my cooking and I like cooking for him.

Then in the evening my boyfriend noticed it was gone. He got really mad because it was a present from his business partner and it was apparently really expensive. He has locked himself in his room since, demanding an apology.

When I used to work full-time (I’m currently out of work due to an injury), it wasn’t a problem most of the time because I would crash after a long day. Now that I’m not overtired, it’s almost impossible for me to sleep in our bed. I have one of those brains that won’t stop thinking about EVERYTHING, and it takes me a minimum of 30 minutes to 2 hours to fall asleep-whereas the boyfriend is out and snoring in minutes.

Of course, but this pattern of trying to sleep, getting woken up, trying to fall asleep, getting woken up, leaving the bed and fall asleep elsewhere is getting to me. I also don’t want to rely on sleep medicine all the time to force me to fall asleep. 

The reason it’s a pattern is because every night the boyfriend complains that I don’t like sleeping with him. “I sleep better when you’re in here”. “So we are just going to sleep separately forever?” “Can’t you just try and sleep in here tonight?” (which I do try 90% of the time until he dozes off)

I saw a girl (who I had just met that day) trying to think of ways to keep her phone safe since she didn’t have any waterproof containers so I offered to let her share mine. She has an iPhone7+, which is waterproof to an extent. I asked her if her phone had ever been damaged just in case, as if a phone is damaged/repaired, it can reduce the water resistance and I told her that I would not trust it. She said no. 

An hour into the trip, i checked our phones and it turned out that the bag failed and had filled with water. She saw this and got worried but decided to keep it in the bag anyway because it was probably better than nothing. Both of our phones still worked at this point. 

After the trip, her phone wouldn’t turn on but mine was completely fine, as mine has never been damaged in any way. It was at this point she decided to inform me that her phone had been cracked and she had the screen replaced, which can compromise the water resistance, as I said earlier.  

Today, the day after, she asked me to pay for a new phone, to which I told her no, but offered to let her use my old iPhone 7 as a replacement until she can get a new one for herself. 

Am I the asshole for not paying for a new phone since it was my bag?? Or did I do my due diligence and I’m in the clear?

0,"AITA for RSVPing no to a wedding before even knowing the date? | A horrible person I know is getting married. I want no part of it. He sent a save the date and the card told everyone to RSVP online as soon as possible. So I RSVP no. I'm not necessarily busy, but it is one of those obnoxious weddings with black tie attire, no kids allowed, etc. Basically no way in hell I want to spend a Saturday. 

I see my spouse is invited to the bridal shower. Spouse dislikes the guy even more than I do, and doesn't know the bride-to-be besides a few awful, awkward encounters where the bride was shit faced drunk. At her request, I RSVP no to the shower. The problem is, we haven't even gotten the invitation to the shower yet, so I just declined an invitation to a party without knowing where and when it is going to be. AITA? I feel like an asshole. 


Possible mitigating factors:  1.) the wedding website required me to respond to all ""active invitations"" ie I had to make up my mind on the shower or I couldn't RSVP no to the wedding.  2.) Money is kind of an issue, we'd both need to purchase more formal outfits and/or rent a tux, as well as pay for a sitter, and we're in the middle of an expensive move, new jobs, etc.  3.)

0,"AITA for not wanting to stay for 6 months with my mother while she is going through divorce? | (First time posting, will edit if there are any issues or if some points not understood)

So here is the basic situation, I (23M) live in a city which is 6 hours away by bus but 1 hour flight away from my home.

This is my last semester, so after one month i finish my university studies. Now in the middle of the semester when I went back home for one week (like a winter break) on the first day a fight broke between my parents (48M) (44F)and apparently my dad had another woman in his life other than my mom (not the first time btw), and on that week all hell broke loose. within 2 weeks my mother wanted to separate quietly but my dad wanted custody and my mom didn't agree, so my mom files a law suit for the divorce and in this whole time my dad is denying all this and saying that my mother is hallucinating (but he doesn't know that my mother has evidence on him and not planning on telling him until the day of the hearing which really makes arguing impossible).

Now i'm living in a lively city, its like the newyork of my country and i love it, i just met a girl im in love with and its been going great, i'm taking latin dance lessons and it really helped me take my mind of all this, my friends are here, the job potential is better here, my workout routine is set here, my network is here, everything that matters to me and that i did through all these 4 years is here in this city, unlike my hometown.

Yesterday i call my mother to check  on her as always, and immediately starts asking when i'm coming back and says that when i do i need to stay by her side to support her and that she needs a man by her side (i saw this coming eventually and whenever the topic started in the past i always implied that i'm not coming back to stay). The period she wants me to stay is 6 months, until the summer or until my 17 year old sister finishes her university exam and gets into university, then we can all move to the city that i studied in. When i told her that that is not possible and i'm not willing to stay for that much all the time, she started arguing how i am selfish, not thinking about her and what shes going through and that i'm her eldest son and she did not raise me to be like that type of person. I don't believe that my mom is going to move to my city without my dad having a word about that for the custody of my little sister, and if she leaves alone, what about my sisters? i don't know what is going on through her head.

I'm willing to go back every 2 weeks back home, and willing to bounce on a plane given the emergency.

I get it my mother is going through a tough time, i need to be by her side, that my father cheated on her and its devastating, i get it that family matters and family must come first, but i don't want to live in all that negativity and stress for that long, i don't need it, i don't want it.

Well today we had to go grocery shopping but since only one person can go at a time I was picked to go. When my sister(23F) texted me the list I asked if I can not buy the tampons and someone else can go later. She asked why I said I'm embarrassed to buy tampons.

For some background she has an autoimmune disease that when it flares up she is unable to walk around for long periods of time, so we had a rental wheelchair and I was pushing her. We were going towards one of the stores when we saw a child riding an electric animal with no one around watching them and they were headed towards us. Full eye contact was made and I held the course we were going, and right before we hit them they pulled away. I thought nothing of it but my girlfriend thinks I should have moved out of the way, and I disagree, if the kid doesn’t want to move then that’s his choice. Thinking on it later I feel maybe it wasn’t the best choice, AITA?

1,"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to sleep with a stuffed animal when with me? | So my girlfriend has a very squishy stuffed cat she's also sleeps with. I find this incredibly childish as she's 32 and this isn't even a beloved childhood memento but one she got this year. When we sleep together I like to wrap my arms around her when she's often cuddling the cat or sometimes we're cuddling facing each other with the cat between our breasts (I'm female too.) I don't really like it because it feels like she's focusing on the cat and not me and she's too old for it anyway. I asked her to not sleep with it with me and she thought it was ridiculous, she also doesn't like I refer to it as ""it"" instead of ""she/her"" or call it by the name she gave it. If she were 15 years younger this would still be quite immature in my view.

1,"AITA for making my mom cook on my birthday? | Here it is. I (32M) and my girlfriend (24F) recently went on vacation. My mom has a house in (beachy location) that she said we could use. She usually stays there October-March, but she was supposed to be out of town, which was totally fine with me. My mom can be kind of needy, and I wanted the vacation to be just about me and my girlfriend. Unfortunately, her plans fell through, so she ended up being there the whole time. 

I was already a little annoyed, but then came my birthday. We were supposed to have steaks and asparagus for my dinner, and my gf won’t touch meat, she’s vegan. I told my mom that I shouldn’t have to cook on my birthday, and I requested that she make dinner for us. She had wanted to go visit a friend that afternoon, but she didn’t end up having time because she was prepping the food. 

She never said anything to me, but apparently she told my gf that she was disappointed not to see her friend. In my view, it was my birthday, and she should have wanted to help me make it special. My gf is neutral on the situation.

0,"AITA for telling my father to fuck off for telling me I need to get my daughter into basketball? | I feel like I was too harsh and even my husband thinks I could have done it better but I feel like that's partly because he hasn't felt the full weight of my father's micromanagement. 

Growing up I had certain interests, I was VERY into these activities. Around the time I was in the 8th grade my sister got jealous of the success I was having in this area. After that point I was strongly ""discouraged"" from taking part in these activities unless it was at school. Instead they pushed me to work with children. They told me it was my gift (super Christian family) and that I shouldn't squander my talent. 

So there's the background on why I think I responded so strongly. My youngest daughter is tall and always has been. She's 11 years old and 5'6"" and is still growing. Starting at about age 5? My father has pushed me to make her do basketball. Because she's tall, I mean let's ignore the fact that she inherited my clumsy gene, that she's a very shy girl, that she hates crowds and noise. Ugh.

Anyway a few days ago I made a rare visit to my parent's house, I felt it was safe because family friends were there. I was bemoaning the utter lack of art day camps or just evening classes. All three of my girls love art so I'm looking for something that they will actually enjoy. 

My father brought up fucking basketball again. ""You need to get youngest daughter into it, who cares if she doesn't want to. You're the parent just tell her she's doing it.""

Honestly it brought up a lot of really shitty feelings that I didn't realize were still hanging around. I got up grabbed my purse and told him he could fuck off and left. So reddit am I the asshole for my reaction here? Was I overreacting? I'm really torn here, I'm generally a people pleaser but I really don't think I was out of line and I'm certainly not going to apologize, because I'm not really sorry. Which makes me wonder if I'm an asshole for not apologizing.",False,False
0,"AITA for not moving out of my seat for a large group of students in my school’s library? | So I’m usually in the library during my dead times between classes. It’s not unusual to see segregated tables. All the Asians in their own tables, and Indians in their own tables. These two groups tend to take up whole tables, but on one floor, all the Indians hang out there and take up to like 4 tables. I have no problem with this, because there’s really no reason to be. It’s not peculiar to stick with similar people, and that’s what they’re doing, and I don’t have any problem with it. 

I come in early in the morning on test days to study for an hour or two. At this time, the tables haven’t become of one group of people yet. I sat in the first table that was the least populated at the time. The groups of friends that sit in the same tables, are always situated in the same tables, so maybe their argument that these are their tables is valid. 

So after about 40 minutes of studying, the groups of them start situating themselves at the usual tables in groups of 3-5. It’s the usual, and I’m not bothering anyone so I don’t really bat an eye. Soon enough, the table is fully occupied with the select group of students, and then there’s me, kind of in the middle of the table. 

I don’t mind being surrounded by them and their conversations, since they’re all med students and I honestly like hearing what they talk about, or their gossip. I’ve sat at other tables and they’ve talked loudly enough for me to pick up everything. And sometimes I laugh when they laugh because they’re having a good time and they’re ambiance is enjoyable. 

So once they started pouring in, they surrounded me, since I was in the middle seat. They usually take other chairs so they can all sit at the same table. I didn’t mind them sitting around me at all. I’m doing my work and not causing a problem. At one point, one of them walks in after everyone is seated and he pointed at me like “Who’s this kid.” I didn’t pay attention to it and kept reading my stuff. 

They asked me to move, but I told them “he can just pull up another chair, its going to be hard for me to find somewhere else to sit.” I don’t know where he’d find this chair, since there’s none available. 

They kept reassuring me to move from my seat for this last one, but it’s a hassle to find a new seat at this time of day. They asked me to move like three more times and I finally just sighed and informed him, “Bro, I’m not gonna move for you. I was here before anyone else at this table.”

Now they’ve been giving me faces and shit. I could’ve moved, but I’d have to spend about 10 minutes looking for an open seat.

0,"AITA for refusing to let my partner to play my savegame with me present? | While this might sound petty at first, I guess it's just a symptom of a deeper issue. So bear with me.

I was playing the new Pokemon Sword and my partner started to watch. After a while he wanted to take over and play a little on my savegame. I declined and said he's welcome to play with his own savegame, because I want to experience the game on my own and not have to watch him make progress on mine. To be fair I sometimes react pretty strongly in situations where I believe something ""is mine"" (it's hard to generalize these instances). Neverthelesss a small fight ensued.

My argument basically boiled down to ""Sometimes I want something that's just mine.""

His argument was ""There shouldn't be mine and yours, there should only be ours.""

Now he's pissed and I'm wondering if my reaction was too strong and whether I should have just let him play for like 5 minutes. Thoughts?",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting SO to listen to podcasts all the time? | My SO is a big fan of podcasts. He listens to at least 10 and has them downloaded to his phone. I am not a big fan of podcasts because voices distract me a lot. I prefer to listen to music or nothing at all, and on the occasions when I do listen to a podcast, I don't do many episodes because I get headaches.  


My problem -and the reason why I think I might be the asshole- is because he is constantly listening to podcasts all the time. I don't mind the subject, the guys or whatever the joke is about. What I mind is that he puts them on his phone, all volume up and it's just one after the other on loop for hours. There's been times when I've found his phone on the kitchen with a podcast, his computer on with ANOTHER podcast and the TV on with another one. Hearing all this voices all the time stresses me and I get to the point where I just tell him to shut them up. He has stopped listening to a few because of this and I feel awful about it because it's not that I don't want him to listen to them... I just wish I didn't have to hear them 12 hours a day as well.

Recently I told this to my brothers, and they said I was overexaggerating and being mean, but it really bugs me. Can't he just headphones?

1,"AITA For Losing Attraction To My Boyfriend For His Interest In Anime | Posted this under a different account somewhere else and it got removed so here I am.

To sum it up, my boyfriend left his laptop open with an anime gif up on it. I went over to look and he was logged into an anime subreddit, so I clicked his profile history and he's very active in that community. This was weird because he never mentioned an interest in anime before. I didn't say anything but I started paying more attention and the next time he left his laptop open I seen he had an account on an anime viewing website and has watched *alot* of series.

He works in a lumber yard and is the exact opposite guy you would think would like anime. I asked him about it and he admitted he was a big fan and that he never told me because people look down on the community so we left it at that

But in all honesty it does somewhat lessen my attraction to him. I find it really childish, we're both in our twenties and I'd like my partner to be a bit more grown up and masculine. I used to watch some when I was a teenager but I feel like we should be past that now. I have trouble seeing him as the rugged guy I used to see him as even though I wish it wasn't like that. I know it's probably petty in the big picture, but I'm thinking about asking him not to watch it or to cut back.

I went to get some food out the fridge the other day and it really smelt bad...I was trying to figure out what it was and it was some fish she had in there. It didn’t smell right and I used to eat fish so I know when something smells right and when it doesn’t. I messaged her saying that it really smelt and could I throw it out because I didn’t want it contaminating our food. She messaged me back and said she only got it the other day and it would be fine, and that I probably just didn’t like the smell cause I’m  vegan. I asked her when she was coming back and she said in a couple of days. 

So I threw it out..,

When she came home she asked me where it was and I said it really smelt bad. She was like ok you can pay me for that...

I Was like, I’m not paying you, it had gone off. Now she’s all angry at me, calling me disrespectful saying she’ll just throw out my food when she feels like it!

0,"AITA for getting mad about a stolen slice of pizza? | Last night I bought a pizza during a movie night with friends, gave half away, and put the last 3 slices in the fridge to have for dinner the next day. I let the roommates know I was saving it. 

In the AM, I went to work. When I got back at 6pm, there was only one slice left- no longer enough for dinner. Nobody else was there, so one of the roommates must have eaten them. I asked them each individually... Not mad, just curious: "" hey did you eat my pizza ?"" Never did I imagine they'd both say no. So I was like wtf, one of you is lying to my face? 

Thing is, one roommate is always tracking macros and doesn't usually eat pizza. He easily convinced me it wasn't him, so that leaves my friend of 5 years lying to my face about something so assinine as pizza... Which makes me both disappointed and pissed, especially since my only reply to ""yes, I ate the pizza"" would have been ""oh ok cool"". 

Girlfriend and her friend are making fun of me for questioning my friend ("" dude you don't have to lie to me...I would not care"") while they're cracking jokes about a pizza bandit. Meanwhile I find this insulting enough to damage the friendship. Like I'd never lie to this friend about anything, much less a slice of pizza.

1,"WIBTA if I left my child for a better opportunity | I’m 32 and got a late start in life. I am about to finish college and I have an opportunity to travel and do some things in another country. 

When I was 24 I met and married someone and we had a child. About a year later we divorced. Mostly because of me but some her. I was a loser stuck in life. I had no direction. No job. I had failed out college twice already. I was a drain and completely depressed. All I did was game and I discovered that she was making plans to leave me so I decided to leave first.

She has primary custody and I have visitation. I pay child support on time but admittedly it isn’t a lot because I am in school and jobless. I work part time a bit for my uncle. 

She has a good job now (she had originally put her advanced degree on hold so I could finish undergrad which she has always resented me for)  and she remarried. They seem like a picture perfect couple. He seems like a good guy. My child seems to love him. 

I am struggling really bad in this town. In this state. Near them. 

A friend of mine gave me opportunity to travel with him next year. I am set to graduate with a BS finally and may even look into getting an advanced degree in another country.

The issue is that I see my child once a week now. We are close but I can tell he doesn’t really need me. We hang out and I can’t afford to do anything with him. I don’t even have my own place. We are buddies but I am scared that is all we are since his mom does everything parent related. 

I tried to join the army a few years ago and got kicked out during basic training after a month. I just couldn’t keep up. 

If I told my ex she would be mad at me. She would try to talk me out of it. If I left, i’d do it without telling her. I’d still send my court required child support though. She already complains I don’t see my child enough. 

If I left I likely wouldn’t be able to come back for a year. I wouldn’t see him every week. I would be sad. But I might have a chance at a real life. Traveling, making connections, good job, not being some sad sack on a couch just waiting for Saturday afternoon with my child to roll around and studying and working in a shop. 

My child has two awesome adults taking care of him (and seeing that is tough for me) and maybe he can come see me during the summers when I get settled and earn more money. I’d call him often. Maybe when he gets older he could come live with me if he chooses.

I'm female, married, and a vet. went back school using my education benefits/student loans and I'm almost done with my Master's. My husband makes $10 working full time as a temp in a factory. We've been together for a decade and married for about four years. He knew that there was a strong likelihood that we would have to move after my degree program. Now that we're approaching that point, apparently I'm now restricted from going certain places because we have to be in a state that isn't too restrictive on guns, because that would be taking away his freedom. That leaves me with pretty much the deep South, the rustbelt, and a scattered array of other states where I'm probably not gonna be able to make a living. Most of the jobs that pay a living wage in my field are in big metro areas, VA, DC, and so on. Again, this was discussed. I also brought up the possibility of moving abroad, but apparently that made him super angry because he stormed off and accused me of being inconsiderate.

I love my guns too. Don't get me wrong. I don't particularly want to go where I can't have them, or am restricted from having certain things that I can have right now. It's not like I'm trying to move somewhere where we can't have them. The bottom line is, I have student loans to pay... and honestly, most of that went to keeping us afloat while he was in between jobs for a year (I found him the job he has now... I was going broke paying his half of the bills while going to school, and I couldn't take any more hours at work without failing because of my schedule), and that was on top of him need health insurance (I have the VA... I didn't need it. I'm basically having to pay for both of us to have insurance so he can even qualify for it). I would like to 
at least pay off those student loans so we don't have to spend our lives in poverty. I'm not asking him to do it. I'm not even asking for help. I'm asking to be able to get a job that allows me to do so. It would be one thing if he had a degree, or knew a trade, or something... Anything, really... But he doesn't. He hates his job, doesn't want to go to school. He has no aspirations to do anything at all that actually involves any more planning than what he's doing now. Am I the asshole for wanting a better life for both of us? And feeling like I should be able to go for that, since I'm pretty much the breadwinner here? 

I just feel like I've been extremely forgiving and honestly very flexible about this. I've asked him to find somewhere he would like to go. I've asked him for suggestions. I can only do so much.

0,"AITA for being upset by an April Fool’s joke? | Mobile post, formatting, blah blah blah.

Backstory: I’m currently student teaching high school English and have had issues with my mentor teacher all semester. She sits in the back of the class and texts or distracts kids whenever I try to teach, which undermines me and makes me look like the bad guy when I attempt to get on task. I’ve talked to her and it got better for awhile. She’s awesome at building relationships with students, but it often crosses the boundary of “friendly vs. friend” and disrupts my class. 

Now to the situation.

Early in the day, my mentor had the idea to play a prank on our last class of the day by pretending they had an essay due. I told her that I didn’t want to, but that she could. I hate April Fool’s day, but I’m not about to rain on anyone’s parade. She decided to do it. 

Last period comes and her prank is funny and easygoing, the kids laugh, I’m finishing some work while it happens, all is well.

I’m then attempting to start the lesson when two girls - who have a long history of fighting - start shouting and squaring up in the back of my class. My teacher runs out saying she’s getting admin, and I try to keep everyone’s attention off the girls. 

She re-enters with a male teacher and they take one of the girls outside. Again, I attempt to start my lesson and the class follows.

As we’re getting into our reading, my mentor bursts through the door and starts screaming at my class, “SHE IS OUT THERE BAWLING. WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER? I NEED ANSWERS, NOW. KATIE (the other girl), WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?”

I felt completely embarrassed for my mentor, as I felt like this outburst was completely unprofessional. I finally snap and say, “If you need to have that conversation, take her outside. You need to get out. We’re trying to work.” and my mentor takes her outside.

We again try to get on task.

My mentor then comes in with the girls about ten minutes later and the girls say “It was a prank.”

Me: “Okay”

I keep teaching.

The girls: “That’s it?”

Me: “We’ve already wasted over half our class on pranks. I’m not interested in wasting anymore.”

My mentor comes up to me in the English office after class, laughing, and I say “Did you help them plan that?”

Mentor: “No, but I was told to play along.”

Me: “Yeah, well, you’re the teacher. You’re the adult. You should’ve shut it down. I’m so angry that I’m ready to walk out. That was completely disruptive and disrespectful. How was I supposed to know what that was?”

There were a few signs saying ""Quiet please, this lounge is being transformed into an area for prayer, meditation and relaxation"", but seeing as how I was literally the only one there and I was just quietly studying, I thought I would be fine. After an hour, a guy came in with a prayer mat and started praying. I was as quiet as possible, and didn't acknowledge it but I feel like it made him uncomfortable as he kinda peeked in the room and walked out before hand. I thought it would be worse if I straight up bailed as soon as he started praying, so I kinda just chilled there and continued to review my flashcards. I wasn't in front of him or anything either. But I still feel like kind of a dick for encroaching in his prayer, especially since specific prayer rooms dont exist in our uni. This is also the second time this has happened to me, and one of my friends called me a slight asshole the first time for not leaving when someone came in to pray.

Naturally, I took time off of university to look after him and visit my mum in the hospital. I love them both and I would do so much for them.

Today is my birthday and I caught a stomach bug. I had diarrhoea and was vomiting all night until there was nothing left, so I became really dehydrated and lost quite a bit of weight. I went to the doctor so I could be prescribed something for the dehydration and pretty much slept the rest of the day, taking minimal sips of her prescribed fluids since nothing was staying down.

My family has this tradition every year where we have a birthday dinner, so the birthday person will pick a place to eat and we’ll have a good time as a family. Today, my mum decided she wanted expensive gourmet burgers, but I said to her that I was really sick right now and would prefer if everyone ate something cheaper and healthier for tonight and if we could postpone the burgers for a later date when I felt better, partially because I also didn’t want the smell of burgers all around also.

My doctor had told me not to eat any greasy foods. I wasn’t able to keep anything down, so even though I love burgers I just knew that I would get sick if I ate them so they’d be a waste.

My mum went livid. She told me she wanted burgers, and I said that was fine, but I also knew we couldn’t afford a second birthday dinner since we don’t have much money and that I really wanted to spend family time together, with this being my only birthday wish. She called me a selfish, childish bitch and I was very hurt by this. I had spent the entire past week trying to help my parents and I thought my birthday would be the one day where I could be allowed to be a little selfish, so I decided I needed a time out. She went out to get burgers and the beautiful cake she ordered (which I am very thankful for, since she ordered it before I was sick and there’s nothing I can really do about that now).

I decided to go to my boyfriend’s house to study just to clear my head and get away for a little bit. I left my mum a note saying that I’ll be back before 11, that I just needed some space to cool off (because this had been a really hard week for all of us) and that I loved her very much.

A lot more has happened since - my Mum is really upset and telling me to leave her and my dad alone forever which really hurts me because I do love them so much and I’m trying my best - I just needed a break.

0,"AITA for feeding my cousin a vegetarian dish and causing her to have a breakdown at our family dinner? | Chinese New Year is almost here which means there are a lot more family dinners. My family is responsible for hosting all these dinners because we have the bigger house which means we're also responsible for cooking everything.. Every dinner, we have about 20-ish people over and nobody has any allergies or diet restrictions except for one cousin. I don't know her all that well at all and I don't have her on Facebook or any way to contact her. I only thought that she is vegetarian because that's what my aunt told me. She said my cousin eats noodles made from eggs and has no issue with eating vegetable dishes with animal products in it  so I thought for sure she's not a vegan since they're against ALL animal products. 

My parents were responsible for cooking various dishes for all 20 family members and I was responsible for making the vegetarian dish. I thought it was pretty silly because a lot of Chinese dishes are already vegetarian and she can just eat those but my parents said she should have a big dish so she wouldn't feel excluded or left out. I made a simple egg noodle dish with various veggies because that's what I had in the house. I didn't have any pasta or noodles that was made without eggs or other animal products. 

When it was time for dinner, my cousin thanked me a lot for ""making a vegan dish"" just for her. I immediately knew I was in trouble. I could've just kept my mouth shut to let her think she was  eating something vegan but I didn't want to lie to her about her diet so I told her the truth. I said, ""Your noodles were actually made from an egg dough.. Your mom said you eat it all the time?"" She freaked the fuck out and I don't blame her because I know I violated her diet restrictions. She threw the dish on the floor and made a big mess. She started yelling at me and my aunt actually tried to stand up for me by telling her that she ""eats the same exact noodle dish every week"". 

Apparently my aunt mixed up veganism with vegetarianism and she's been feeding my cousin vegetarian dishes for the past two years. My cousin had no idea because she never cooks and doesn't know the specific ingredients of what my aunt makes for her. My cousin didn't take the news well and she left the dinner. All my family members (except my aunt) started saying ""tsk tsk"" and asked why I would make something like that for my cousin. They blamed me for not being closer to my cousin and not knowing what she likes to eat. I think that's unfair. I know it's my duty as the host to make food for the family but I don't think it's fair to blame me for the entire situation. Am I the asshole?",False,False

I am dating Mary. Mary and I have been seeing each other since late June, but she is just now starting to hang out with me around friends and family. 

I also have a really good friend Jane I have know for a really long time. She is my younger sister's best friend, but she also is like a sister to me given how much time we've spent together over the years. Jane is really outgoing and friendly/affectionate.

This past weekend I had some people over to my place to hang out. In this group was Jane, Mary, my sister, and some other friends of mine or my sister. We were playing some games, and Jane wanted to partner up. No really a big deal. We partner up for a lot of games because we make a good team (usually we win). 

My living room is not huge by any means, and definitely isn't big enough to fit everyone at my place, so seating was cramped. Jane decided to sit on my lap. She has not done this before, but it's not unusual for her to be affectionate and friendly with her friends so I don't consider it weird (also because as I said she is basically family). 

My girlfriend was very testy all night, and later when I had a chance to talk to her she said it was because I let Jane sit on my lap. She feels like this is inappropriate and also doesn't like how touchy she can be with me, but I don't see the problem. Jane has always been this way. She doesn't mean anything by it. That's just how she is. She also is very sensitive so to say something would hurt her. I think my gf is making this into something it is not.

She’s slow and in her 30s but has the mentality and acts like 10 year old. She got the job through a program at the local high school and has been here since. She’s capable of the job, we’ve seen her do it. Needless to say she doesn’t get everything done most of the time.

I usually just deal with it because I understand she has a disability and I’m not an asshole but lately she’s been slacking because she knows she can get away with it. My coworkers have told me she won’t do things and say “I don’t have to because OP can just do it tomorrow.”  Lately she’s been skipping things but telling the crew leaders that she’s “finished up early.”

She did it again yesterday when I wasn’t there. Didn’t do about a third of the job and told the crew leader she was finished. So today I called my department manager and told her on her. It’s one thing to not finish because you’re disabled and have problem, it’s another to just be lazy. I’ve come to resent her as a person.

Basically it's doing the same job he was doing plus more at a salaried rate. The owner snookered him by offering him what sounded like a lot of money but he's making less money because he's working more hours. Plus there is a legal minimum wage for salaried workers and he's being shorted by 7K a year. So he's being paid less money for more work. If that's not bad enough, the owner throws his ""raise"" in his face everytime he messes up.


I hate working there and am actively looking for another position because if they'll do him dirty like that then they'll do me worse because I don't socialize with them outside of work so I'm not considered one of them.

0,"WIBTA If I refused to go on holiday with my 5 year old cousin? | So this summer me (17F) and two of my cousins (20F and 17M) decided to go on holiday together. This would be our first trip without parents, so I was very excited. 

Basically, one of my cousins wants to bring our other cousin, a 5 year old girl, with us. It is not her child, it is just a cousin. Personally, I am not comfortable with this because I don’t want the responsibility of looking after a small child as I am not even an adult myself. I also just want to be able to relax on my holiday, and not babysit a small child. 

When I expressed these feelings to my cousin she basically said that she would look after her and there would be no problems etc. But I still just do not want to go if a small child would be joining us...

0,"AITA for snapping at my brother and telling him he should move out over a simple task? | My brother is 27 and lives at home. I'm 19 and a sophomore in college. He dropped out of college in his junior year of college (I think he was 21 at the time?) and I understand shit happens and its hard to go back to school. All he does at home is play video games. He cooks sometimes but my parents end up babying him. My mom makes him breakfast almost every morning and does his laundry because he is too glued to his video games. He works a part time job but other than that, its just video games. My parents have been trying to encourage him to go back to school, whether his old uni or community college, or apply to a different job (he hates his customer job.) and he just shuts down and tells them ""yeah yeah now get out of my room."" and slams the door and goes back to video games. My dad is in his 70s and still works to keep the family stable and my mom works everyday and gets one day off a month if shes LUCKY. And it has been bothering me that my brother doesn't do much for them and has them do his laundry and stuff.

I am close with him and have encouraged him to get therapy and I'd even help in anyway I can and he always goes ""that won't help."" and I ask him if he wants to open up about anything going on and he usually just says nothing and continues his video games. It's been me doing this for him for years and trying to help him and I give him space if he asks for it. He blows the family off to play video games all the time. I ask him to spend some time with me whether its saying goodbye before I leave for 4 months for college or just sitting down together or if we can play video games together even and he usually refuses.  

Today I asked him to help me with a simple task that our mom asked us both to do (literally just wrapping something and putting it in the fridge) and I just asked if he could get the other tray of food and put it in the fridge while I got the other. He just yelled at me and told me to get out and he wouldn't help me. He was playing a video game that he could've easily paused. I lost my shit. This is almost verbatim what I said, and now I acknowledge it was probably way too harsh:

""You seriously can't help me with this simple fucking task? You basically let our parents wipe your ass for you. You refuse to get help or talk to anyone, even friends. I get that you might be depressed or have something else going on because I do too but all you can focus on is video games. You need to get help and move out and do shit by yourself.""

0,"AITA for wanting to turn of location tracking services my parents use after I leave for college? | So my parents use the iPhone service find my friends to follow my location when they “feel worried” about me which as it is kind of bugs me. The service is similar to Life360 but just gives location updates. They also have me text when I’m leaving and when I’m arriving anywhere, which is quite honestly a drag when I’m with friends but it is what it is. For background I’m a 17 year old high school senior with straight A’s and also take a couple college courses (at my parents request) on the side. I will also be turning 18 before I go away for college. My parents claim they only use the service when they feel worried about my and my 20 year old sister’s safety. For my sister, my mom says she only checks the location at night when she is walking back to her dorm or is out doing something. It amazes me that she is okay with this.

At this time, I allow the service because I am not an adult and have little to no pull on them (ie when I had to argue with them for years about my 9 o’clock bedtime until they finally removed it this year), however I told them that once I go to college, I will be turning off the service on my phone. This was met with a very negative reaction. My parents argue that if I have nothing to hide, what’s the harm. They also argue that if I’m somewhere and I need help, how will they know where to send police. Their evidence for this is the countless hazing cases in frat culture, which I have no intention of joining.

To me however, I view this app as 24/7 stalking and a violation of privacy. This app is absolutely ludicrous and makes me feel very uncomfortable, not because I plan on doing anything illegal or dangerous, but simply because I don’t want to followed and monitored because it not only degrading me to the status of child, but also shows that my parents don’t trust me. Furthermore, it comes off to me that my parents are being control freaks who are not willing to respect my boundaries. In case it is important, when we last had this argument, they said if I didn’t keep the service enabled on my phone then they will be cutting me off, to which I replied that was counter intuitive, as it would prevent me from calling them for help in the event that I actually needed it.

Some extra information in case it is needed:
-the college I plan on attending is about 3 hours away
-I am a straight A student
-I have zero history of risky behavior(drinking, drugs, smoking/vaping)

0,"AITA for not returning ex’s things after he told me he pee’d on my couch 3 months after denying it? | Ex told me he pissed on my couch

Three months after I broke up with my ex, he texts me randomly, asking for forgiveness (I’ve given him enough chances, so my good bye was final); when I didn’t respond to those texts, he responds by telling me he had pissed all over my couch and carpet just a month before our breakup, and then lied to me when I asked him why BOTH my couch cushions and even the upholstered base and frame under the cushions was wet, and why my couch has this weird stain. He simply insisted the couch and carpet were wet when he arrived and would not take my version of events. At that time, our relationship was already on shaky grounds and I had spent the better part of that day researching couples counselors and trying to convince him to go for couples counseling, so I really didn’t have the energy to pursue another battle about the couch. 

The fact that he knowingly let me sit on that couch for months after he did this is just mind boggling. I had even jokingly said to him the morning after the wet couch incident, “how did you spend the night watching TV on this couch, it’s so wet” (he watched TV till late). He just said he sat on a wet couch and it was a miserable night for him - the couch was too small, (it is actually larger than standard couches); the couch was wet; he can’t sleep in my house because he does not know where anything is (because I just moved two days ago and I did the whole move by myself 100%; he actually stayed at his house and played video games all day after promising to be around to see the movers did their job OK); he just did not like my house (he was a big complainer, so it was difficult to solve anything / reach a constructive solution with him). 

I am livid at this, but recognize that he is trying to engage me. Then he sends a text saying he will buy me a new couch. I am furious at his lies from that night / morning, but do not want to engage with him right away, so I stay silent. (He was / is someone with narcissistic tendencies and I really don’t want to engage with his word salad ever again). 

On the flip side, I have something that we both bought together and the plan when I broke up was that I’ll be selling it and splitting the funds between us; will come to about 300$ each. Ever since this I got these texts about him pissing on my couch, I do not care to return him anything. It will cost me as much to get a new couch and carpet- probably more given that my furniture is a couple of price points above Ikea.

I told him to stop doing that, and that she’s not going to know what he’s saying / why he’s doing that so it’s achieving nothing. He later on wanted me to apologise for “being rude to him” but I said I wasn’t going to apologise because I don’t think I did anything wrong - and calling him out on behaviour that makes me uncomfortable isn’t something I’m willing to apologise for. He was pretty unimpressed with this, and when I asked him if he’d be willing to apologise for what he did he said no because he doesn’t think he did anything wrong / yet he still expects an apology from me and doesn’t see the hypocrisy in wanting an apology from me when I think I did the right thing when he’s not willing to do the same.

I didn’t actually expect an apology from him, just thought we’d move on with our day, but now he’s being stroppy and grouchy because I haven’t apologised. Anytime I try to say we should just meet in the middle and move on, he gets grumpy and repeats that I should be apologising and he didn’t do anything wrong.

1,"AITA for feeling the way i do about not getting a job I interviewed for? | A guy I know who I will call Joe for this post, recently told me about a job opening at the company he works at, I was quite excited when I applied as I am currently working at a lower paying job that I am overqualified for and that I hate, and this job that I was applying for was everything I really wanted.


Joe, my ‘friend on the inside’ was not high enough in the company to pull any strings for me, which is fine by me, as I wanted the job on my own merit, but he was able to keep me in the loop of what the company was looking for and what the hiring manager was saying about the candidate.


Sometime after the interview (which went extremely well), my friend told me that he had found out the hiring manager, who I will call Al, had narrowed it down to two candidates, me and a girl with dyed bright purple hair and several facial piercings, as we were the only two candidate that had the right qualifications, I had seen this girl in the building waiting to be interviewed and I immediately assumed that I would get the job due to her immature and unprofessional appearance. So, I was shocked when I was later informed I did not get the job.


I was genuinely curious about why, so I asked Joe if he could find out anything. What he eventually told me infuriated me. Joe tells me he spoke to Al (who did not Joe was feeding me info, Joe just acted like he was curious), and Al explained that me and the other girl were virtually identical on paper, same qualifications, virtually the same experience, there was nothing to distinguish one from the other, so in the end he gave it to her, because he “thought her hair and piercings were awesome, as he loves that kind of thing”.


When Joe told me this I was really surprised and asked what’s up with Al, Joe said he doesn’t know Al that well, but has always thought he was a bit weird, he did mention that Al only ever dresses in black and had mentioned in the past that he is a goth and maybe that had something to do with it? Al was wearing all black the day I met him, but it was normal business attire, so there was nothing that stuck out to me.


Later on that day, I ranted to my sister about all this and how ridiculous it was, and said that it makes me feel insulted (though I can't explain why) and my sister chided me for being judgmental and entitled. She said she was sorry I didn’t get the job, but that she was glad the alternative looking girl did, as she has many alternative friends herself, and she feels like it makes me an asshole to say that I literally feel insulted that they chose the other girl over me.

Context: I am a 4th year medical student with experience in hospitals, GP surgeries and care homes.

The flight takes about 12 hours in total, and about 9 hours in a call went out asking that any doctor or nurse on board to make themselves known to the cabin crew to help with a medical emergency. I didn’t volunteer. I’m not sure what the emergency was, but when we landed we all had to wait on the plane whilst an ambulance came and collected the person that was sick, so I’m guessing it must have been serious. 

My friends were with me and called me an asshole for not volunteering to help as I will be graduating as a doctor in about a year and I have experience with working shifts on wards throughout the hospital. 

I didn’t volunteer because, whilst I do have a lot of medical knowledge, I am not a qualified doctor yet and I have always had doctors and nurses around when I’ve been treating patients in the hospital.

Today we went for lunch with my parents along with my brother and his family. When we left Lucy was in tears and is still crying now that we're home. 

I'm pleased to say Lucy got an offer from Oxbridge. She aced the interview and got a conditional offer. While she still needs to get the grades in the summer, we're sure she will seeing as she's top of all her A Level classes and often gets 100% in exams, assessments and coursework. I'm so proud of her. 

Naturally Lucy is very excited and was happily telling her grandparents and everyone else the good news. 

My brother has a son, I'll call him Harry. He wanted to do IT or something like that, but unfortunately hasn't been accepted to anywhere he applied for. Understandable he's very upset. They're looking at other universities as well as things like apprenticeships or entry level jobs. 

My brother had a word with me and Lucy, saying that while he's very happy for her, we should be a little sensitive because of Harry.

At dinner Lucy was excitedly telling everyone about her uni. We explored the place when we went for her interview and it's truly beautiful. She was talking about all the exciting things she'll get to do. I know she was getting a bit too carried away but no parent wants to stop their child when they're this excited and happy. 

Harry was staring into his food the whole time. My brother attempted to interrupt and steer the conversation away from Lucy/Oxbridge, but Lucy still had more to say.

Lucy was still excited, but her attempt to say any more resulted in my mother snapping at her that ''we'd all heard enough'' and that she should think about someone else for once. She called her a ''spoilt and rude girl''. Lucy started sobbing and ran out. 

We left soon afterwards and Lucy was crying in the car. I am RAGING. I'm sorry that Harry didn't get the place he wanted. Truly I am, but why should that mean Lucy isn't allowed to talk about what she's achieved? Do they have any idea how hard it is to be even considered to study medicine at a university like that?

0,"AITA for being jealous of my husbands close relationship with his aunt | 
This is my first time posting I hope it makes sense. 

So me and my husband have been married for a year now. We decided to skip the whole wedding and just elope as my father passed away that year. I don’t have any extended family but he comes from a very big and close knit family. (All of whom live in a different country except his Aunty and uncle) 
I only met them once before we got married and immediately I realised she didn’t want him to get married. 

After we got married he was supposed to move in with me but he kept making excuses that he didn’t just want to leave his auntys house that quickly because it would be rude. I agreed just to make things easy. 
Fast forward a few months he finally moved in. I thought this would be the beginning for us to spend more time together. We picked one day out of the week to be together usually a Wednesday which is his day off. Usually when the day comes his Aunty and uncle call atleast 15 times telling him to come over and every single time he blows off any plans he has with me to go to them. 

I tried to be understanding that they are the only close family he has here but I never get to spend any quality time with him. 
He always makes excuses when he hasn’t seen them for a few days. 

Even when he talks to them on the phone he gives them undivided attention. There has been occasions that she or her husband call him while we are in bed and he’ll get up to talk to them sometimes even leaving the room
but when his talking to me about something important  his always on his phone or watching something and barely listens. This always results in a fight. 


I grew up with family dinners so I tried to keep that tradition so I make sure that we have dinner together every night. His Aunty has since started sending him food in the day so that when he comes home he has food to eat. He stopped eating what I made because she makes him traditional back home meals. 

Our marriage broke down fast he stopped caring for me. When I found out I couldn’t have kids after years of trying he left me crying in bed and was busy dealing with his auntys drama. 

I asked to separate a few weeks ago and he moved out. We have started talking again but he refuses to acknowledge how priorities his aunt over his life with me. 

I have never had any aunts or uncles he keeps telling me it’s normal to be that close to your family. I don’t know if I’m making a big deal about nothing

His PC is 7 years old and he's been wanting to upgrade for a while so he can play new games at high resolutions. I'm also a gamer so I understand the frustration of low FPS and ugly graphics however we bought a house last year and two months later he got fired so he wasn't eligible for employment insurance. I've had to pay for the bills for 6 months before he finally got a job again this year. During that time I paid for him to take a supplementary course to be more employable while paying for mortgage, his car payments, and literally every other bill. Luckily I have a good-paying job and an emergency fund so I was able to handle the financial burden. I was never mad at him for losing his job but I was upset and stressed that I was barely breaking even.

Anyway, he started working again on January and I told him to keep his earnings for a few months so he can start paying off his car (4 years left) and start saving. He makes around $2k/month and his only bill is his car payment of $500/month but he still only had $1k on his account before the refund was deposited. I don't know where the fuck his money goes but I didn't want to be controlling so I didn't push it.

Now with whats going on in the world and the industry we work in (oil) struggling, we're both at risk of losing our jobs. I asked him to hold off spending $2k on a new PC since we both might lose our jobs any time but he got mad at me because I spend my money however I want. This is kind of true but I also pay for all the bills, have zero debt, maxed out my registered accounts and set aside money for savings. I focus on our priorities first before I spend the excess on myself. If it's relevant, I make 3x what he makes and I spent $1k of my return on an exercise equipment (I've wanted to buy it for him) before I knew he wanted to make a new PC; the rest went to emergency fund. I just want him to have a cushion of savings for himself so that he doesn't need to rely on me financially if he were to lose his job. I do feel that it's unfair to him that I'm restricting how he uses his money but I think it's justified due to the current circumstances and I think that the refund is a great head start for him to save. He would still have $3k left to save but I don't trust that he won't use that because he's never known how to save.",False,False
1,"AITA for not letting my gf smoke a cigar? | Basically I will smoke cigars when I am drunk, I only ever do it when I am drunk, not sober. She told me she wants to smoke one, but I told her no because she has a heart condition. This isn't really serious enough to just kill her from smoking one cigar, but I just told her no and that I wouldn't let her.

She told me I was being controlling and she just wants to try it, and to stop freaking out bc she isn't going to inhale. She told me she doesn't really like the idea of it either, but I shouldn't tell her no, since I do. I told her that just because I do it, does not mean she should do it. I would never do it sober, I barely ever do it anyway.

She said that I also was being irresponsible for acting like being drunk makes me smoke. Anyway...

0,"AITA for not wanting to teach my step daughter to drive? | AITA For not wanting to teach my boyfriends daughter to drive?

My boyfriends daughter (19) has enrolled in drivers ed to learn how to drive she has to document over 40 hours of driving. The last time I took her out driving she had nearly caused multiple car accidents from not listing/paying attention to the road.
She will run red lights, cross in to other lanes without looking, and has often shifted in the wrong gear (such as drive when trying to reverse or reversed when trying to drive)
It’s to the point I do not feel safe being on the road with her.
Today she asked me to drive and I refused due to safety concerns of her driving.
She threw a fit to her grandmother and her mother staying I’m not wanting to help her learn to become independent when the issue is I just don’t want to get in the car with her to drive. I have no problems helping her with homework or any questions she has about signs. 
It’s become a power struggle at this point and I’m emotionally exhausted from trying to explain why I don’t feel comfortable and or safe driving with her.",False,False
0,"AITA for calling out professor for making fun of me in class? | Backstory real quick: (20M) I’m a ginger (orange hair, freckles, and I wear glasses as well) and have been made fun of for it for basically my whole life; I’ve had to hear just about every term in the book from firehead, red, carrot top, firecrotch, etc. All of it really pisses me off but I try to keep it to myself b/c god forbid people think I “can’t take a joke”.

On several different occasions a professor I had in one of my tech classes this past semester made “jokes” about it. Second week of the year he says after forgetting my name “I’ll remember you, you’re the guy with no soul” and third week “Oh that’s right EverywhereForever, you’re the ginger with no soul”. Most of the class laughed, I was pissed and too embarrassed to say anything. It stopped for awhile after that though. Towards the end of the semester though he did it again, and I straight lost my cool and said “It’s not funny. How would you like it if I called you baldy every day I walked in?” He didn’t say anything, class was quiet and he just continued with his lesson. I left for the bathroom b/c I was embarrassed and just got it together and walked back into class like nothing happened. The next day a kid talks to me outside class and said I was a dick about it and I just shrugged. Far be it from me to think something as arbitrary as my fucking hair color would be beyond juvenile and insulting remarks in college. AITA for the way I had reacted to this? This was mostly younger kids who had just graduated last year I think so I guess it may have influence on how they think but I wouldn’t expect it from a professor.",False,False
0,"AITA for this argument about studying and video games? | My parents and I have been having an argument. My parents sat me down and asked me about my grades. I told them all the ones that I know. Some of my teachers don't post the grades to Google Classroom so I don't know what some of them are. I have 4 confirmed a's (3 are above 95%) and 3 b's. I'm in 8th grade. Right now I get 2 30 minute sections of game time per day after I do school, homework, and the extra 1hr of math that my mom tells me to do. Our school has a placement test for high school that helps the teachers decide what math class to put us in. I ***chose*** to be put into the 'lower' (i don't know a better word) math class. I've been not doing as good as my parents want me to in math. This happened during the grade conversation. My parents after hearing that I chose to be put into that math class got very mad that I didn't want to go the the higher math.

About an hour after I told them the grades that I know and that I was going to the 'lower math', they told me to study more. I've been studying more, about 2-3 hours each day+studying during classes. They cut my video game time down to 1 30 minutes after they have checked to see if I've done all my homework. I got mad and asked them why, and my mom said, ""We are done talking about this."" After that I went and studied math for an extra hour to try to make them happy. They are still mad at me for having the grades that I have atm. I'm studying more, but they don't seem to see it.

0,"AITA for smoking weed on my patio, even though it disturbs my neighbor? | I have been living in my apartment for a little over 6 months now. During this time I've had no problems sitting on my patio and enjoying a pipe or a joint. 

However, the family that lived above me moved out and was shortly after replaced by a young (mid 20s?) couple. The first time I saw them on the patio after they'd moved in, I said hello and introduced myself, the woman complimented my dog and that was that. Later on that night, I decide to bring my (small) bong outside for a short while. At this point, I'd heard them talking on their patio for a while, so I knew they were out there but I didn't think anything of it. Very shortly after I started smoking, one of them said something and they both started laughing and went inside. I thought ok whatever. But since then, every time I walk by and anyone's on the patio they'll ignore me when I wave, and whenever I go on the patio while they're out there they immediately go inside (sometimes even when I'm not even going out to smoke, it's like they just don't want to be around to even risk it).

So it seems pretty obvious to me that the smoking bothers them, since our introduction was so positive and everything since has been really strange and icy. While I know that I'm not breaking any rules (legal in my state and confirmed with the apartment when I first moved in that it was a smoking community) and am allowed to do what I'm doing, I kind of feel bad going out when I know they've been outside enjoying a chat for a while. But at the same time I've been here much longer and it's always been fine, so I don't want to have to change my habits for their sake, especially since they haven't said anything directly to me and instead have been a little rude about it.

1,"AITA For telling a woman who joined our company she is not good at her job? | Throwaway.

To keep things vague, I (26 M) work at a client servicing company, last year I got promoted to a senior level and have had to take on more responsibilities and do less grunt work. As a result, the company hired a middle aged woman (possibly in early to late 50's) to take on my old duties. 

The reason I point out her age is because she is severely behind in technology which translates to lots of mistakes in her work and inefficiency. 

As a result, over the past few months I have been constantly having to stay late and help her with any issues she's having. It seems like she doesn't want to listen. As a result, I brought her in for a meeting and told her she is not meeting expectations and I might have to talk to our manager about her performance.

She got upset with me and tried to argue that she needs time to learn more. I told her ""sweetheart, you keep making the exact same mistakes over and over, new mistakes are fine, but you're not learning""

I tried to keep the criticism light but our relationship has gotten worse since then. Now she tries to avoid talking to me, seems more standoffish. I told my manager about her shitty attitude and work and he officially gave her a bad review.

So last week she called a meeting with me and told me that she didn't appreciate me giving her a bad review and that I target her. I reminded her that everyone else at her level is performing at expectations and basically said to her ""sometimes you have to be a big girl about these things and use it to try to improve."" 

She again argued with me, saying it was my fault until I lost it and said ""you're just not good at your job, maybe it's not for you."" She ended up leaving for the day, and unfortunately I think she cried. On one hand I feel like an asshole for being blunt but on the other, she was not improving at all despite my warnings.",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my boyfriend off? | I’m (20f) a stay at home to my 4 mo old baby that my boyfriend (24m) & I share. He works over night & sleeps up until an hour before he has to go work again, so of course I’m responsible for our daughter 90% of the time. 

He just got back to work as he spent the entire year that I was pregnant unemployed just because. He is qualified and can easily get a job but he chose not to. He was able to do this because a few years ago I was in a bad car wreck and received a decent amount of settlement money for my injuries. The whole time up until now, we have been paying the rent with my savings. Even now that he works he hasn’t contributed to rent, the only thing he pays for is when we go out to eat. 

For the past week, I have had extreme migraines & dizziness so I scheduled a doctors appt. I spent the night at my grandma’s because the appt was much closer & I figured it would be easier to wake up here since I had been feeling bad & would have to drive less in the morning. 

Coincidentally, his mom & my grandma live in the same complex. After he got off of work, his plan was to go to his moms to sleep. We also agreed the night before that he would watch the baby while I went to my appt. 

He gets out of work at 6 AM. I woke up at 10 AM, appt was at 11:30 AM. It took me a while to get out of bed because of the migraines & dizziness, & I also got up several times in the night to feed/change the baby. I figured by that time he was already asleep but I would call him to wake him up to let him know I was going to be leaving for my appt soon. 

Remember that his mom & my grandma live in  the same complex, meaning it would have taken him less than 2 minutes to stop by & pick up the baby. I asked if he could do this because I was very dizzy, I still had to eat, get myself ready, & get the baby ready. I would’ve been able to save a little bit of time & effort if he would have just stopped by to pick up the baby. If I had to drop the baby off, I would’ve spent more time also because his mom talks my ear off even if I say I’m in a rush.

He said he was not going to come pick her up because he was “trying to sleep” that he would send his mother instead. His mother has spinal issues and cannot walk down the stairs, especially not with a heavy car seat and diaper bag. Aside from that, I would’ve had to remove the car base from my car & install it in hers, which was going to take me even more time & was going to be hard for me to do with my symptoms. 

I get he works over night, & he was “trying to sleep” but he had been home for the past 4 hrs but when I asked for a favor that I never ask for, he’s trying to sleep. We ended up getting into a bad argument & said some ugly things to each other. 

Am I the asshole for telling him off? I have built up over time which I have previously communicated to him but he brushes all of it off.

TL;DR: I have an appt because I’ve been suffering from extreme migraines the past week and my boyfriend refused to drive 2 minutes to pick her up so I could go to my drs appt.",False,False

But because he starts at 5, and I make dinner at 6, he’s been trying to take it to his desk and work while eating.

I think that he should eat at the table like a normal person and that taking the food to his desk sets a bad example for our daughter. He has refused to eat with us so today I just wouldn’t give him the food unless he sat with us. He ate at the table in silence and then before I went to bed yelled at me that I have “no right” to tell him where to eat.

I thought this was clearly the right thing to do until my manager and the CEO pulled me into a room yesterday and said my policy was threatening the productivity of the company. In their words my promise to ignore performance on sick days was giving people ""free reign to take advantage"" of our company.

0,"AITA for making a bet with my husband that caused him to give up naming rights to our child? | Bit of an odd story. I'm a Cowboys fan and my husband is an Eagles fan. We actually met tailgating at a Cowboys Eagles game back in 2010. 

Fast forward to 2018 and we found out we were pregnant. My husband and I have vastly different taste when it comes to boy names. I love classic and traditional names and he prefers names that are much more uncommon. We decided that to make a bet. If the Cowboys made it farther than the Eagles, I got naming rights. If the Eagles made it farther than the Cowboys, he got naming rights. We did something similar for our dog but that was with fantasy football. Now we have a doggo named Mcnabb. 

Both were eliminated in the divisional round. After some disagreement (the Eagles technically made it one more day but only because they played on Sunday) we decided the higher record would win. That meant I had primary naming rights. 

We had our baby about 2.5 weeks ago. I gave him a traditional name that is associated with a former Cowboys player. I posted his picture and name on Facebook for friends and family to see (I live in a different state than my family) and so many people asked how I convinced my die hard Eagles fan husband to give my son a name that was associated with a Cowboy. I told them our bet and all hell broke lose. People asked how I could make my husband give up his naming rights, his brother said I should be ashamed, and my own mom said she couldn't believe we let our son's name ride on a football season. 

My husband isn't mad about this in the slightest. In fact, he has said he wants to do it again and that he'll be naming the child Carson regardless of the gender if/when he wins.

1,"AITA for not wanting to put my dog down? Never visiting a vet? | I grew up on a farm, and we had a dog. We got the dog when I was 4. My dad didn't believe in vets or anything, and growing up with my dog, I never saw her get sick, get seriously hurt, even get fixed. Our dog lived a long life until she hit 14 or so, which as far as I know is pretty old for a scottie. She was as lively as you could possibly be for someone of her age and we always got comments that she acted like a puppy even days before she passed. I don't know why she passed, but she wasn't hurt or sick, she just went to sleep on our kitchen floor one afternoon and didn't wake up.

We got a new dog, another scottie, My family still lived on a farm but I moved out when the dog was about 6. I brought her with me, and now I live in a more urban but not quite a city area. We never had her fixed or get any shots, no nothing. And I never did either, when I left.

My dog is 13 now. I'm married with two kids and my family adores my dog. I joke sometimes she was the wingwoman in keeping my wife around when we began dating. She's as springy as a puppy still, the trend continuing from my first dog. People are genuinely surprised when we ask them how old they think she is, only to find out she's 13. Most people guess 4 or 5.

Recently, however, I noticed a small growth on her belly. My wife thinks it's uterine/ovarian cancer. I love my dog to death but I worry about bringing her to a vet. She hasn't had any shots, isn't fixed, has never even set paw in a vet. The unreasonable part of me thinks they'll hurt her or take her away. I talked with my wife a bit and she said it's my decision as I've known this dog the longest.

I don't think I could bring her to a vet. She doesn't seem affected by this recent situation. But this also means I don't think I could get her put down if it got to that point where it becomes bad. I can't definitely say at this moment because we're not at that time, but knowing my first dog died in her sleep maybe makes me think this one will be a similar ordeal. Peaceful, without stress.

0,"AITA for not contacting a restaurant about a billing error after the worst eating experience of my life? | Hi all,

So I was in a new town for a job interview and decided to unwind the night before by going to a hookah bar/cafe.

Suffice to say it was a nightmare, I had to reorder my hookah 3 times (walking up to the counter the last two times) because they never actually wrote down the ticket and the servers would just go start shmoozing with the regulars. Then I waited literally 1.5hr for a soda I ordered when I walked in and had to wait another 45 minutes on top of that for a small food order. Fortunately after telling them I’m diabetic was starting to pass out it only took them 15 minutes to grab the soda from that point.

When I finally got my cat food meal and ate it I went to pay. I was first charged for the wrong bill and had to spend 5 minutes convincing them that no lone human being could have actually consumed the amount of food/4 hookahs I was charged. When I finally get the right bill they’ve added on a 25% service fee because my “party” (they sat me in a booth with other people, I don’t know a single soul in the state I was in) was more than 3 people.

I go ahead and swipe my card because they won’t budge on that and I have an Uber in the parking lot waiting for me at this point. There’s some sort of error. Rinse and repeat, same error. Swipe a third time and I get the same error, but after signing. They tell me I’m good to go though and that it happens. As I go to leave a bouncer legit prevents me from exiting saying I still haven’t paid up. Since they couldn’t print me a receipt I have to go hunt down the manager who tells them it’s cool.

0,"AITA for calling the police/CPS on my SIL? | Going to try to make this as short as possible while including details needed. 

I have been with my fiancé for 6 years. Fiancé has an older sister, we'll call her Sally, who is 28 and has a 5 year old child. I was there the day Sally was in labor and Baby was born, she is my niece. His entire family has referred to me as his Auntie since day 1. I am not blood but we are family, she calls me Auntie and we have sleepovers, zoo visits, etc. 

2 years ago Sally was in rehab from drug addiction. Alcohol, pain killers, and Xanax were her thing. She had a mental breakdown and the family collected money to send her to rehab and all organized a schedule to take care of Baby. The baby's dad, Sally's boyfriend, has a welding/construction job and was out of town for 2 months so he wasn't there for all of this. 

She checked herself out after 3 days, insisting she was ""fine and just needed a safe withdraw"". I pick her up, take her to her house, and she immediately goes to smoke weed and drink a beer. I don't think weed is a drug and am very pro-cannibas although I don't smoke, but that was not appropriate considering I just picked her up from rehab. 

A week later she was fired for snorting in the bathroom., evicted for being 4 months late, totaled her car driving while high and is being sued for $50k from wrecking into a house, and was kicked out of Fiancé's other sister's house for forgetting the sink was plugged up and running (she was high) and the entire downstairs was RUINED from water damage because nobody else came home for 8 hours. $20,000 of damage and thank god their house insurance covered it. 

That was all last year. They've been in their new house on their own for about 6 months. In November she called FIL and said their electricity was shut off because she didn't have the money because BF's paycheck got messed up and didn't go through. He paid their late electricity bills.. a total of $500. I thought it was suspiciously expensive but kept my mouth shut. All has been quiet since. 

Two weeks ago, she asked me to borrow some money to get groceries for Niece. Of course I'm not going to let my niece or sister go hungry, no matter what is going on otherwise, so I say I'll be over at 5. I got off work early and get there at 2:45. I come in using my spare key, walk in, see Niece playing with dolls in the corner, Sally passed out on the couch, and heroin on the coffee table. Unfortunately coming from a family riddled with addiction, I know what heroin looks like. I don't know how much it was, but I could have scooped it up and filled my palm with it. I noticed radiators everywhere in the front room and Niece was in multiple layers of clothes and her winter jacket. The heat was off. The house was maybe 40F - it was 30 outside. 

I took Niece to my car, and called 911 for an ambulance as I was scared Sally was overdosing.  I didn't want to alarm and freak out Niece so I stayed in the car and let her play on my phone until the ambulance arrived. Of course police and CPS showed up as well. I explained the situation and because Niece's dad is out of town working, FIL/MIL were called. When they arrived they were quiet and cold, didn't really talk, took Niece, and told me to go home. 

An hour later I get home and fiancé asks me what I've done. I explained everything to him and all he had was anger for me. Apparently the entire family already knew and were pissed at me for what I had done. Apparently I was ""out of line and stupid"" because I called 911 before seeing if she was actually OD'ing because it turned out she was just nodding out from the heroin. We fought for hours and I left and spent the night at my best friend's house and cried all night. I couldn't handle it all so I turned my phone off and tried to relax and just calm down. My best friend was up all night with me, telling me I did nothing wrong, and I'm okay. 

I turn my phone on and I had 65 texts/messages. MIL, FIL, SIL, fiancé, and their extended family members blaming me. They are saying I ruined her life, ruined Niece's life, made everything more complicated than it needed to be, made it public when it was a ""family affair"", and ruined Sally's chances of ever getting cleaned or having custody of her child again, none of them ever want to see me again and I will never see my niece again, and they want me to pay for Sally's jail bond and sue me for the CPS case and emotional damages.

I am also now single. So on top of losing my best friend of 10 years (fiancé), I will lose my apartment I had with him, what I considered my family, and my Niece.

I truly feel horrible. I have horrible anxiety to the point where I'm worried someone is going to come get ""revenge"" on me for what I did. I can't eat. I have lost 7 pounds from it. I'm not sleeping for shit. I have bags under my eyes. I've had 8 migraine-days in two weeks. At first I felt so confident in my decision but as the days go by I'm thinking maybe they were right and I should have checked on her before calling 911 and being frazzled. I don't care about Sally anymore, but I did rip a 5 year old child away from her parents and I feel horrible about it. I know someone in the family will take her in, but it's never like being with your parents. She will grow up resenting me for it and all I've ever done is love her as my own.

1,"AITA for not forgiving my younger sister? | My sister is very nice sometimes. But she's also very annoying and rude at other times. Something that's been pissing me off lately is the fact that she never focuses with me. Wheather I am telling her a story, or showing her something, or teaching her something, she doesn't focus. She claims she is focusing with me with her ears and understands perfectly. I always tell her that it annoys me when she does that because I feel like she isn't focusing. For a while now, I've been teaching her to play songs on the guitar. This is the best way we bond and I really enjoy it. The only problem is that she only focuses with her ears and not her eyes, that way, I can't tell the difference between ""I can hear and understand you"" and ""I wasn't focusing"". So I politely ask her to stop. Eventually (as usual) I lose my temper and yell like a school teacher to her loud students. She apologises and everything is fine. But that's not the problem. A while ago, I did something I was really proud of. I went to the living room to show my sister and she was only focusing with her hearing (I was playing guitar). I understood that she was focusing with me because it happens a lot. But I soon realized she was looking at the computer we share. I lost my temper and left before I can finish what I wanted to show her. She apologized and I didn't forgive her. I am planning to forgive her once I post this text, but I just wanted to know if I was the A-hole.",False,False
1,"AITA for ""blackmailing"" my professor for his plagiarism? | This includes me and three other classmates. Some say we were AH for stooping to his level, others say we were justified.

I'm a private-university student on their last semester. This semester we got a new professor. He seemed nice, but would avoid repeating himself or explaining things. He was pretty vague, and would drawl out whatever he said almost as if to waste time. Nobody pressed even if they had questions because it's the first few days and no one's comfortable yet.

The issue started when he posted the first powerpoint presentation to our class online (that has his name, his chosen theme etc) on a certain subject and we had to find more info on it for a lot of points; normal stuff. But when I was looking deeper into the subject for the assignment I came across an older presentation on the internet done by some *student* from another country. And it was word-for-word copypasted. He had just changed the layout, font and put his name on it. Prof's Powerpoint was made recently, we checked. I wasn't the only one who noticed.

We didn't think it was a big deal to get him *fired* over (plagiarism is prohibited in my university and gets students rightfully kicked out); we're talking about a single presentation here so far. Nobody has snitched on him yet. But his attitude did bother me. I just came to the conclusion that this professor was being lazy and half-assing things which were ultimately important for us (we're talking about our future career here, and are spending *hundreds* to attend this class only to be handed material written by a *student* from another country?).

So three classmates and I decided the assignment we handed back in also had copy-pasted material and was edited minimally. To our surprise, he raised a stink about it during class although he didn't call us out by name.

After the class was over, I approached him and told him it was unfair that he'd hold us to a different standard when he himself had plagiarized the original assignment from a student and gave not even some credit. He kind of sputtered a bit and told us that as students we had to be better than that because we were working towards a degree while he had already finished his.

He ended up giving us good marks and not outing us for the plagiarism, but earlier today in class he was grumbling about having to deal with a blackmail situation.

AWTAHs? Us not speaking up about it *did* let him keep his job.

1,"AITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her ""boyfriend""? | A little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he ""waves"" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. 

I posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent ""what are you girls wearing tomorrow?"". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of ""your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night"" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).

After finding this out. I said ""I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple"". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent ""work husband's"". I'm not ok with either.

Anyways our relationship seems to have been getting better; she calls more often and tries to reach out and have dinner more often than she used to. She recently messaged me asking if I wanted to have dinner for my birthday, but while we were discussing things she wanted to ask if I'd like to meet her fiance. Regardless of my reasoning, I feel like it's perfectly reasonable for me to not want to meet her fiance on the night that is supposed to be celebrating my Bday, but when I expressed that I wanted to not make my birthday celebration about her engagement, she replied ""Well that's bitchy."" I have no problem with meeting the guy some other time, and i've expressed this to her pretty tactfully so far, but to no avail she has kept pushing and clearly doesn't get what I want or care to understand.

She responded with ""6'6"" (lie cause I'm that)"", said something like ""wow very impressive"" which she smiled at somewhat awkwardly before walking off to get the machine ready.

0,"WIBTA if I didn’t let my daughter go to Disney World? | A little backstory.. My daughter, we will call her M, just turned 5. Her dad and I split a little over 3 years ago, but the last year and a half or so of our marriage we were really just roommates and he didn’t have much to do with M or me. Since then I have remarried and we have a 1yo son as well that M adores. After the split M’s dad moved into an apartment with roommates about 20 minutes from us. She was to spend every Wednesday and ever other weekend with him. This only lasted a month. Then he suddenly couldn’t have her on Wednesday’s anymore, then he couldn’t have her on Friday’s either. And then she ended up going to her paternal grandparents every other weekend and her dad would “visit” her there for a couple of hours Saturday and/or Sunday. (He would mostly be playing on his phone or watching TV while his mother took care of M. I know this from his sister) Then in April of last year M’s dad moved 8 hours away and rarely sees her anymore (he came to visit for Christmas and then her birthday in May and probably won’t be back until thanksgiving or Christmas). When he visits he stays with his parents and M stays there too so they can spend the most amount of time together possible. However he only gets to spend about 3 days here when he comes to visit and a VERY small portion of that is actually spend with M. He is more worried about hanging out with old friends etc. He originally said he was going to call her daily, but he calls once a month if she is lucky. 

Now to the dilemma. M’s dad wants to take her to Florida (9ish hours from us) for a week and take her to Disney world. He KNOWS that I love Disney and have been looking forward to taking her basically since I found out I was pregnant. 

I do not feel comfortable with her going as she barely knows him and he has shown on several occasions that he isn’t exactly fit to be a father (example: when he lived here with roommates M got sick one time while spending the night there and her dad WOKE UP his female roommate and asked her to give M a shower and clean her off because he wasn’t sure what to do. M also told me that when she woke up early in the mornings her dad would tell her to go get said female roommate instead and let him sleep). 

I would be perfectly okay with it if he wanted to come here and spend a week with her, just not them going so far away. Alone.

1,"AITA for telling my friend's mom the May/June 2019 IGCSE grades have been out for a while? | Oddly specific I know, hahah... here's the full story:

The grades were announced on September 2019. My class threw a huge wobbly about it because most of our grades SUCKED. Many opted to hide the grades from their parents but of course the school issued a letter stating the grades shortly after they got out.

I guess this friend got lucky and intercepted the letter before her parents received it. I adviced them to own up and tell. Their grades aren't flawless, to be frank, but they're not dreadful either. Just a bunch of Cs and Bs. They dismissed me.

Several days ago, I met her mother. We were talking and the subject of IGCSE came up. She complained that the certificates are taking a while to arrive. That's where I went ""screw it"" and told her that the grades and certificates are out already, didn't she know?

I don't know what happened after I told her that but something must've happened because my friend has been giving me the cold shoulder ever since.

I have severe depression and she has really bad anxiety. Throughout our relationship I was putting my needs on the back burner when she needed me because ""a depressive episode isn't as bad as an anxiety attack"". This mindset only made my depression worse. 

Eventually I broke up with her because I realised I wasn't happy anymore. We stayed  friends to start with but had a hook up a few weeks after I broke up with her since then we've been ignoring and avoiding each other. 

About two weeks ago she got admitted to hospital with a high fever. I knew some friends were going to visit her so I didn't go, not knowing where we stood and not wanting to ask. 

The other day, however, she messaged me, just asking how I was. I asked why the late message (since it was 2am) and she started to talk about how lonely she'd been at the hospital. And how ""i guess no one cares about me as much as i thought"". Obviously I felt bad for her, but it ws exactly this kind of talk that made my depression so bad I had to leave the relationship. 

I told her in no uncertain terms that ""I don't want to listen to this anxiety ridden self consciousness over and over again"" and that ""I'm not your therapist"". She responded that she only wanted to talk, but that she gets it.

However, I've started noticing that every visit, he goes to the bathroom and spends 20-30 minutes in there - clearly taking a dump - and uses a minimum of an entire roll of toilet paper.

I was so furious about it I took them out of his bag and put them in a cupboard. I planned on asking him about it as soon as he came out but I was overtaken by rage, and then when he returned I was overwhelmed by doubt and embarrassment that I was being strange and unreasonable.

Everything was going smoothly until one day I was locked out of the shared account (I set it up so it was registered with my credit card and email). 

I wasn't able to regain access to the account and Ann admitted that she was selling 2-day passes to random people (and kept the money for herself) for them to use the account. So of course the strangers she sold the account to likely shared the login with their own friends, the account registered a really high amount of activity from different IPs (this wasn't an issue when just the 3 of us were sharing) thus locking us all out of the account.

I had to waste half a month's subscription, and then decided to no longer share with Ann. I got a new account and am sharing with only one other person now. Ann feels that she's entitled to share the account with me, because she is now paying a lot more for her own individual account than she was when it was the three of us sharing.

1,"AITA for getting upset over a false paternity test | My wife and I have been married for 10 years. We met in college, and she has been my best friend for almost 14 years now. She is beautiful, supportive, kind, classy, and all around amazing as a wife. 

We went through a really rough patch about a year ago, mostly due to issues on my end. However, she told me she was pregnant. I was overjoyed. She told me she would only keep it if I was 100% in on the baby and the marriage, I said I was fully committed, and we kept the baby.

As time went on, I became increasingly insecure about whether or not the baby was mine. I did the math and thought it was unlikely it was mine, on top of having a gut feeling. I was internally agonizing over this for months, and after the baby was born, I could barely even hold him because I was so convinced he wasn't mine.

I told my wife I wanted a paternity test. She was upset but told me to get one if it would ease my mind. The test comes back two weeks later and it says I am not the father.

I'm absolutely livid. I had an out of body experience. I stormed into our house and just let loose. I felt like I couldn't stop myself, I was completely broken in that moment. I cried and screamed and asked her what I did to deserve this. I absolutely never laid a hand on her.

The whole time, she's just sitting on the couch, trying to comfort the baby. This made me even angrier for some reason, so I kicked her out right then and there. Told her to pack her bags and just get out.

She calls me the next day and tells me that I deserve to know that the baby is mine, and asks me to get a paternity test from another company. I figure I have nothing to lose at this point, and another paternity test can only help me in a divorce, so we get one at the company she suggested, and I sent a third to another company, just to be sure.

I get the results from one and they say I am the baby's father. I wait a few days and don't say anything, then get the second set of results, also confirming I'm the father. I feel like the weight of the world has just been lifted off my shoulders and I can finally be the dad I want to be.

I call my wife to give her the good news and she tells me she's not moving back in. She says she's disgusted with how I acted by asking for a paternity test and my reaction to the false one. She tells me I can come see my son, but she will be filing for divorce.

I don't think my reaction was over the top for a man who thought he was being lied to about one of the most important things.

Recently, I found my mom on Facebook. It was by pure mistake because I reconnected with some other maternal family members that I guess are friends with her. She had the same first name and looks pretty much the same, with just a different last name. The more I looked at her page, however, I saw that she had gotten remarried not long after she left my dad and had basically started a new family. She has kids ranging in age from 2-10 years old. My husband told me to leave it alone, but I was so angry and I just couldn’t handle it, so I ended up finding out her husband’s FB and messaged him, saying that his wife had 5 other kids that she had abandoned, did he know that? My mom ended up messaging me, pissed, saying I had made her husband mad because he didn’t know. To me, that’s not my problem. You can’t just run off and neglect my responsibilities.

0,"AITA for asking someone to get out of my seats? | So we have season tickets for a football game which pretty much just means we have tickets for every home game. These tickets are pretty expensive and we pay a lot to sit we’re we are. Alright on to the issue

So we have five of these season tickets but at this particular game our fifth family member couldn’t make it. Regardless, we bring all five tickets anyways. So around mid game when we are seated and watching, some random dude sits in the empty seat in our row. Now, we obviously know he doesn’t have the ticket to sit here and frankly we want him to move. 

So I say “Excuse me but you don’t have the ticket for this seat, can you move?”

He responds “Is there someone sitting here?” 

I said “No, but we have the tickets for this entire row and we would appreciate it if you could move.” 

He responds “I don’t see the problem with me sitting here if no one else is sitting here.”

After this, I tell him to please move or I’ll call security. He gets quite pissed and and cusses me out before he finally leaves. So my question is AITA for asking him to leave?",False,False
0,"AITA for only selectively giving up my seat to elders on public transport? | Hi, this is a mental dilemma of mine. Might get slammed for the opinion, so I'm using a different account.

I'm far from an impolite person. With that said, I won't deal with verbal abuse from strangers who are clearly just looking to take out frustrations. In an everyday setting, this applies to angry people on public transport.

I'm a physically healthy 19Y/O girl, meaning I can give up my seat to those in need. Unless I'm literally losing consciousness or something, but that hasn't happened yet. But I refuse to get up for anyone, regardless of their age or state (unless heavily pregnant or severly disabled) if they're quite obviously acting shitty because they believe it's within their rights to do so.

I've encountered these situations on multiple occasions, most recently last week. I was riding on a bus home from class, staring out of the window because the line was packed and you want to avoid making any awkward eye contacts. When I turned my head, that was when I first noticed an older guy standing next to me.

I apologized for not seeing him and offered my seat. But that set him off on a loud tirade about how he'd been standing there for over 5 minutes and that I should've moved instinctively because of his cane. Despite the fact that I didn't even see this person, let alone his cane. Everyone was staring at us. His goal was obviously to humiliate me and come off as superior, because if he just wanted to sit down, he would've gotten my attention earlier and asked. Or literally any other seated person.

So I told him no, I'm not giving my seat up for anyone who acts like a child and insults me. After that he called me a disrespectful brat, which just made me more convinced in my decision. He left to another part of the bus and I could hear him swearing under his breath.

In your opinion, was I the asshole for refusing to give up my seat to this man? Personally, I don't believe his age and the walking aid give him an excuse to lash out at strangers. But I could be looking at the situation in the wrong way.

0,"aita for not wanting to tell my partner I think his book (his baby) is crap? | My partner has been writing a novel since I've known him. It has been a way for him to relax and I fully support this. 

He often asks me if it is good. 

I feel so horribly guilty about it but I don'think that it is. He uses names and traits that are literally identical to famous literary characters and scenarios that are action 101. He is aware of this and thinks it is fine. The book isn't a 'oh that reminds me of....' it is flat out 'oh this is from that movie...'. If someone sued him for copyright, I'd think 'that's fair', in fact if I was them, I would. He sets it in a different country which he says makes it not fan fic and that it is 'inspired' by the original. 

 I cannot criticise the book in any way because although he says he wants an 'honest opinion' constantly, if I even suggest a word change, I get a half an hour on why that word was chosen and he brings it up subsequently when he mentions it eg: 'I know you hate the (word) in chapter 5 but...' even months later. He is snarky and catty about even if he feels like I haven't listened to the latest part with enough enthusiasm. 

His father always made him feel worthless and so he is sensitive. 

He will talk to me for ages about a plot twist or the latest situation and I listen and he feels great afterwards and thanks me profusely for being 'so supportive' when I've just agreed with him the entire time.

I think he could write a fictional pov about his real life (which is interesting) and people would lap that up. He disagrees. 

He has decided to try to get this novel published now with plans of sequels and has informed me that he would be furious if I lied to him about it and that he wouldn't be able to EVER trust me again. That this book will take money and time and that he doesn't want to waste it on a pipe dream no one wants to read anyway. 

I've been justifying not telling him my truth as I see it, by saying things like 'well you know fifty shades sold a lot', that it isn't a genre that I read, 'not every book is for everyone' and skirting the issue because I don't want to hurt him and I am not the decider of which books sell.

I have offered solutions of self publish or a third neutral party or a friend to read the book. 

No dice. 

He has asked me for a truthful review of it.
I am thinking of every good thing I can think of, so I can avoid actually having to answer. If push comes to shove, I will lie.

0,"AITA For Wanting My Brother To Get Rid Of His Rabbit? | About a year ago, my family got rabbits. We originally had three - brothers - and each one of us had one rabbit dubbed as ""theirs"". For a period of time after we got them, everything went fine. We all took turns cleaning out the hutch, feeding them, filling up their water, ect. 

However, about six months after we got them, a fox managed to break into their hutch despite the precautions we had put up, and two of them were killed. The only rabbit that survived was my brother's. Shortly after this happened - at my brother's request - we bought a smaller hutch and moved his rabbit inside. As our house is fairly small, the rabbit ended up being moved into my room since I had the most free space.

I didn't really mind as I was assured that my brother would take the main burden of looking after it and, for a while, that's what happened. But barely a month later, my brother just completely stopped. I quickly became the sole caretaker of the rabbit. My brother would refuse to clean his hutch out or even give him water. I would attempt to get him to do it, only for my mum to tell me to do it ""just this once"".

Just this once turned into every time. I have limited mobility of my left arm thanks to nerve damage from an accident and, let me tell you, cleaning out a rabbit with only one arm is HARD. For the past six or seven months, my brother has done jack to look after his rabbit. The only time he shows any interest is when he wants to get him out of the hutch to play. 

I'm sick of it. The rabbit isn't even mine, yet I'm the only one who does anything to take care of him and there's a large chunk of my room taken up by a creature that I'm not even allowed to claim ownership over. 

Last night I snapped and gave my mum three choices:
- My brother either takes over caring for the rabbit and stops forcing me to do everything
OR
- The rabbit becomes mine and my brother will no longer be allowed to barge into my room to play with it
OR 
- The rabbit goes

My brother went into a screaming meltdown (He's 10 and he literally threw a tantrum over being asked to take care of HIS rabbit) about how I'm so horrible for wanting to get rid of the pet that he ""loves"" so much. My mum got snippy at me, telling me that it wasn't fair for me to expect my brother to look after a rabbit when he already has to deal with school and being on a sports team. 

I lost it at that point. I am barely three months away from my GCSEs and I'm currently being forced to juggle studies and a part time job. When I get to college, I know my workload will pretty much be doubled. I repeated my points again and told her either she picks an option, or I take care of this myself.

Don't get me wrong, I love that rabbit, but it's getting too much. My brother goes mental if I just take the rabbit out of his hutch to play without calling him into the room to join in.

I am not willing to do all of this for a rabbit that I'm not even allowed to play with.

1,"Aita for wearing a hoodie | This was awhile ago. My (M46) family and I had went to the mall after celebrating my daughters (F12) birthday.

My daughter got hot after awhile and took off her hoodie and asked me to carry it. About 30 minutes after carrying it over my shoulder I got fed up with having it over me so I asked my daughter if i could wear her hoodie since it would fit (She prefers oversized hoodies). Because of her being autistic, she can be a little picky over her things, or so im told. So she said “Sorry but no” and that made me slightly more irritated because I didnt think it would really matter. 

Another 10 minutes later my wife and daughter were checking out from a store and I got more annoyed so i just said fuck it and put the hoodie on. It was a little tight around the arms so I probably stretched it just a little but not too much. My daughter had come out of the store to ask for some extra change and saw me wearing the hoodie.

She gave me some upset look, got the change and went back, and was a little quiet for the rest of the time we were there. My wife noticed eventually and asked her what was up and my daughter told her what was bothering her, so my wife demanded me to take the hoodie off, and that she would just carry it instead.

Im not sure what her plan would be for it every day as we have plans to go into town to some nicer restaurants. She has talked before about how she got the dog certified in order to be able to have it live in her apartment with her but also has said her therapist gave her a letter for it as well so I’m not sure in where it stands on her actual mental health.

1,"AITA for telling my sister that my friend has a crush on her but is too afraid to ask her out? | My friend Ash and I are 22. My sister is 24. Ash has been one of my closest friends since kindergarten. He confessed to me his crush on my sister some time in middle school. They have met many times and as recently as June 2019. He kept saying he would ask her out when the time is right and didn’t need my help. Time went by and Ash continued to mention his crush on my sister until our first year of uni, when he met a girl he would later date for 2 years. We graduated and are making the big bucks now. Ash hasn’t been on many dates since his breakup. My sister got out of a 3 year relationship 4 months ago. Thus Ash began mentioning his crush on my sister again. I think they would be compatible from the physical, socioeconomic, and personality standpoints, and I don’t mind my sister dating my friend. I asked Ash if he would like my help, but he said he would rather wait until he feels ready to ask her out himself. But my sister just started dating again. I told Ash that to try to make him more assertive. He’s timid when it comes to women. It’s been 2 weeks since pushing him to make a move, but still nothing. Thus I thought it was best to help him out. 


I asked my sister 3 days ago how her dates are going. She said she’s still trying out with different guys. I asked her if she would consider dating younger guys. She said she prefers guys around the same age. I asked her how low could she possibly go. She said 2 years younger is the minimum. I said that’s perfect because Ash is 1 year and 9 months younger and single. My sister asked me why I’m recommending Ash. I talked him up by praising his looks, job, and personality. My sister asked me if Ash asked me to be his wingman. I tried to dodge the question by asking her what she thinks of Ash. She said he’s alright and told me to tell her the truth. I confessed that Ash kept telling me he had a crush on her and wanted to ask her out himself, but he would get too nervous so I’m helping him get the word out. I didn’t mention his crush on her started in middle school because waiting that long and not making a move is a bad look. She said she was open to trying a date with him even though it’s a little weird he’s my friend. I said that’s awesome and would let Ash know. 


I met Ash today and told him about my interaction with my sister and her receptiveness. He flipped out and said I made it incredibly awkward. He said he made a New Year’s resolution to be more assertive and ask her out himself on Thursday, but now my sister knows he’s a wimp. I told him I didn’t believe he would change his passive ways and said he should be thankful for me setting them up. Ash said he would ask out my sister, but he feels the chance of them starting on the right note is slim now because he won’t seem like a real man to her anymore. I said that’s foolish and wished him luck. He never thanked me, but I think deep down he’s appreciative.",False,False

1,"AITA for not comforting my wife when she throws up/doesn’t feel well? | My(30m) wife (23f) is pregnant with twins and has overall had a pretty easy pregnancy. No swelling, no diabetes, no complications, no fatigue etc. If she didn’t look like she swallowed a watermelon, no one would even know she was pregnant. Her one complication is that she can get “morning sickness” at almost any time. It doesn’t last all day, but when it does happen it’s pretty intense, but usually subsided within 10 - 30min. Normally she just throws up, comes out, and resumes what she’s doing with no coddling or input from me. I ask if she’s alright, and sometimes offer water but usually she’s fine pretty quickly afterwards. This past weekend, I had a friend over and we were playing the game when my wife got sick. She closed the door to the bathroom and we could still hear her, so I turned the tv up a bit so I could hear. After a while, she came out of the bathroom, went into our room, and shut the door.

Soon after, my phone started to vibrate with texts from my wife. She told me it hurt her feelings that I don’t comfort her when she’s sick, and didn’t come check on her. I told her I didn’t know she wanted me to, and if she did she should have told me, I can’t just read her mind and guess what she wants. Plus I thought her closing the door was a nonverbal sign she wanted to be left alone. She sent me a picture of her face, crying, and apparently she’d thrown up so hard a blood vessel in her face had popped, and looked really bad. I asked if she wanted me to come now, and she said no, she didn’t want to have to tell me to take care of her, she just wanted me to do it.

We live a very minimalistic life and I absolutely hate clutter.  My son has too much as it is and it gets to be a real pain to clean up after.  Last year I adopted a minimalist lifestyle and donated a good chunk of out belongings to Salvation Army.  I’ve been open about living this way with all the people in my life. 

Of course I got him a few things, but that’s really all the extra stuff I wanted to add to my house right now.  Most of the guests however decided to ignore my request and brought gifts anyways.    I didn’t want to cause a scene, but I was pretty offended that so many people ignored my request.  I was so torn when my son wanted to open the gifts knowing that I’d just be getting rid of them.  I let him do it though and I’m still not sure if that was the right choice. 

After everyone had left I told me son that he could keep any of the gifts, but he would have to give up something in his room for it.  He did end up giving up some of his things to make room for some gifts (even one of the gifts I had bought for him so thanks for that family and friends) and I bagged them up and on Monday took them to Salvation Army. 

I was frustrated and made a status about it on Facebook about the extra work of having to go down there and it got some negative attention from people who brought gifts to the party.  I don’t really know what I could have done differently, I was clear that people should not bring gifts, but they did anyways.   A lot of the comments feel like backseat parenting.

Guys in that thread would talk about what provinces they'd gotten so far and which ones seemed difficult to get (for instance I think Macau is probably not that easy). But it depends on where the girl is from originally, e.g. a girl from Sichuan who lives in Beijing would count as Sichuan.

I mentioned this being a thing to my girlfriend the other day and joked how thanks to her I had already cleared Jiangsu and made a joking remark about a friend of mine, who's from Sichuan originally, being another option to make progress in the game. Obviously I wasn't serious about that, I'm faithful to her of course. However she didn't really find it funny and asked me what I found funny about that since it was not only gross but also dehumanizing to the girls these guys talked online about.

A few months ago, Natalie (sister) invited everyone except my daughter Evie to her daughter Lucy's 10th birthday party. Her reason? Apparently Evie ''bullies'' Lucy. Nat has been saying this for years but I've yet to see any physical evidence of it. 

Evie is 13. She isn't a bad kid at all, but I don't think anyone can name a 13 yo who is nice all the time. She's a very pretty girl, has lots of friends and is top of her class, and has never been in any serious trouble at school, so I strongly doubt she's a bully. In all honesty, everything is called bullying nowadays. Evie is called a bully because she might have made a few mean jokes about Lucy over many years. It's never been any more serious than that and I would deal with it immediately if it was. Maybe Nat should teach
her daughter that she won't get anywhere in the world by crying when things don't go her way. She'll be a teenager soon too, and it's a tough world.

Evie wasn't bothered about not being invited to a 10 year olds party, but I thought it was offensive to exclude every single child *except her*. That in itself is humiliating, especially as I don't doubt Nat will have happily told everyone why Evie wasn't invited. 

In response, I decided not to invite them to Christmas dinner. My husband was absolutely fuming when I told him this, but when I said my reasons - that people who went out of their way to exclude/humiliate our child aren't welcome in our home - he now agrees, but his mother and brother have been calling us non-stop, saying it would be cruel to exclude them from the family Christmas traditions.

0,"AITA for disallowing homeless people from sleeping on the property I manage? | I’ve recently been hired to manage a property under construction. 

When the developer bought it it was abandoned in a lower class neighborhood and had been for some time. A few homeless people were living inside the structure, a few more slept there on occasion. 

It’s not even close to being up to code yet, and it’s the owner’s responsibility (really mine, because I was hired to oversee the place) if anyone gets hurt on the property. 

The structure is falling down, there’s a lot of danger on the site, and the construction is making it way less safe, not more, for at least a few more months in these early stages. 

I took some precautions, like putting up “no trespassing” signs and locking the main entrances. But that wasn’t enough, there were still people coming in to sleep and/or treating the place as a dwelling/storage space. 

I came in and explained everyone had to move on because the lot had been sold. But not one person actually left. 

I had to escalate it at that point and hired a security guard and installed some motion alarms. The security guard was instructed to give any trespassers a verbal warning, and if they didn’t leave, to call and have them arrested. 

Within a week I was getting complaints from the surrounding community saying we were “criminalizing poverty” and I should let them stay because they weren’t bothering anyone.

This means I’m nearly the youngest of over 20 cousins. We all live close so we throw gigantic family get togethers. All the time.

My grandparents own a pretty big ranch just outside of town. They’re not rich by any means, but land is cheap out here and they’ve owned the property for a long time. Because these gatherings sometimes attract upwards of 40 people, their ranch has been the venue of choice for as long as I can remember.

My uncles are all stereotypically masculine dudes, as are a lot of my older cousins, so our rendezvous generally revolve around sports, grilling, and gambling. Gambling isn’t exactly my cup of tea, but I participate for the sake of being social. I usually lose a fair bit of money because I don’t play cards or know sports teams as well as everybody else. It’s gotten to the point where it’s become a reoccurring joke amongst family members.

Well this time around we have an especially large gathering. So large that It’s determined there’s too many people to coordinate our typical gambling games. To make things simpler, my aunt comes up with an idea. She fills a jar full of beans and places it high up on the mantle. She tells us it’s $20 a guess and whoever guesses closest to the number of beans inside gets to take home all the money. 

For whatever reason this new form of betting got everyone in an especially adversarial spirit. Almost all of the adults participated and many even made multiple guesses to increase their odds. 

Remember how I’m typically ignorant when it comes to gambling? Well this time I was in my element. I could tell the jar was a typical 64oz mason jar, which a quick Google search told me was 116 cubic inches in volume. I also found that a bean was about 0.15 cubic inches. Divide the jar by the beans and I got 773. Then I assumed 20% of it was air, which left me with ~619 beans. To be safe, I made two bets: one for 610 and the other for 630. 

As I’m making my bet, people are giving me crap like “it’d be easier if you just gave it directly to me” and all the other usual ball busting, but I just smile and say nothing. Some can tell something’s up and continue to give me grief for the rest of the night.

After probably 40 minutes of interrupted counting, my aunt informed everyone that not only had I won, but both of my guesses were closer than anybody else’s. 

At first everybody was super happy for me, laughing about how lucky I am. One of the suspicious cousins from earlier asked how I did it, so I told everyone my strategy. Immediately I could see people’s faces start to sour. One of my uncles said “that’s bullshit” and left the room. 

It ended up being nearly $1100. My parents tell me that I should offer to return it because I didn’t earn it fairly. I argue that I had all the same information as everybody else.

1,"WIBTA if I go off on the waiter? | So I went to dinner with my gf yesterday and everything was going well. My gf ordered curry and I got the pineapple fried rice that included shrimp, chicken, pineapple and cashews in the description below. I thought to myself, boy what a deal! We got our plates shortly after and all appeared fine but as I started to eat I was deeply mistaken. No matter how far I dug into the mountain of rice only 2....yes 2 shrimps surfaced. I was satisfied with all the other ingredients but coming to the conclusion that there were only 2 shrimps in the entire plate pissed me off. I considered complaining to the waitress but was unsure if I was overreacting. I also didn’t want to ruin the mood with my gf because I wanted to bump uglies after so I swallowed my shrimp fueled rage.

0,"AITA for getting angry with my white dad for using an Asian accent? | Some context here:

Before Christmas my dad wanted to treat me, my girlfriend, and her (Asian) friend to a spa day, so we went with his girlfriend and her family. While we were drinking smoothies in the cafeteria accent, my dad, who is normally a progressive liberal dude, told a story where the punchline is an Asian man screaming at him to “TAKE A SHOWA”, and when he tells this story he puts on an Asian accent .  

Everybody laughed, including my girlfriends friend, but I could tell the joke made her uncomfortable. I called him dad out and said that he shouldn’t use an Asian accent mockingly like that but his girlfriend pointed out that my girlfriends friend was laughing and we moved on. My GFs friend later confirmed w me that she thought it was ignorant of him to use that accent. 

Skip to today, me and my dad went out for a lovely dinner and a movie and on the ride home I thought I would bring up with him his use of the Asian accent, expecting him to be receptive and understand how those words could be hurtful. Instead, he refused to apologize, said that he saw it as no different then using a French or Italian accent, and criticized me for always attacking and targeted old whites dudes as the cause of all the worlds problems. He said that he saw what I was doing as a dangerous path towards censorship and that if my GFs friend was offended she should’ve “grown a pair” and pulled him aside to let him know

I was so upset in the car that I cried and said fuck you, and I left without saying goodbye. 

Does he have a point? Am I in the right? It hurts so much because I always looked up to my dad as an emotionally sensitive guy and I’ve never fought with him before, but I refuse to just blindly agree with him when I feel like it was wrong of him

Sorry for the long post I’m just really upset right now",False,False
1,"AITA for offering to take my girlfriend out to dinner but when she asked about dessert I told her I didn't want to pay for it? | So today I asked my girlfriend if I could take her out to dinner. We had gotten in an argument this morning but pretty much gotten over it, so I figured this would be a nice way to put it behind us and have a nice night. She said she'd love to so when I got home we both got ready to go out. We were just going out to a casual spot, a brewery actually, nothing fancy. When we were deciding, 

I brought up that maybe we should eat on this side of the river so we didn't have to pay the $4 bridge toll. Normally, it's not a big deal but we're both a little broke right now. But the restaurant she wanted to go to was on the other side of the bridge so we decided to go.

We got to the spot but there was a 25 minute wait, so we decided to go across the street for a cocktail. She offered to pay but I told her not to worry about it because she's even more broke than I am, and she could buy us a drink sometime when she actually had some money. We got the call that our table was ready so we headed over there. Up until this point, we were having a great time. Making jokes and laughing and really getting along. So we get to our table, both order drinks and dinner and have conversation. 

When the waiter comes by to take our plates he asks about dessert and we tell him we need to think about it. We never get dessert when we go out, we typically think it's a waste of money and we usually have some sweets at home. I can tell she's interested in dessert, but I tell her we have ice cream and chocolate at home. She makes it clear that she still wants dessert, and I say something like ""Well if you want dessert, that's all you."" And based on her response, I immediately realized that my point wasn't communicated clearly. So I said, ""Just so we're on the same page, I don't want dessert but if you do, you have to pay for it.""

Immediately things turn. She is taken aback. She goes silent. She's pissed. We sit in silence until the bill comes and we pay. We walk out to the car, start driving home, argue about what happened, and then drive home in silence.

I know I should have worded it differently, but I tried two different approaches before just having to be blunt.

Am I The Asshole?

TL;DR Took my girlfriend out to dinner, bought us cocktails, beers, and dinner. Told her I didn't want to pay for dessert because we have dessert at home. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting my father to walk me down the aisle | Long story short my father and I don’t get along. I’ve had struggles with my mental health that he has belittled and mocked me for and after a lot of therapy I decided to keep him at arms length. Our relationship now is one I’d describe as civil. I don’t tell him anything about my personal life because he’s so negative about everything. 

I recently got engaged and am planning a small wedding that’s not super traditional even thought both of our families are catholic (neither of us are). I told my mom what my fiancé and I had planned for the ceremony and I told her that we weren’t having wedding parties, that my fiancé would simply stand up with our good friend who is officiating and then the music will start and I will walk down the aisle. She assumed my father would be walking me down and I said no, it’s just going to be me. 

I told her my reasoning was I hated the idea of a man giving away his daughter to another man. And that I found the whole idea of giving away a daughter to be rather old fashioned and that I’d rather make my own choice to give myself away. I didn’t tell her the other reason, I just don’t want him to. My mother and I are very close but my father and I aren’t. After trying to have a relationship and make him understand me and trying to understand him for so many years and constantly being disappointed I don’t want him to have any sort of important role in my wedding. I want to walk down the aisle as my own woman and I don’t want to share that moment with him. 

I thought that would be the end of it but my mom freaked. She’s always wanted us to be closer and never accepted that I can’t fix the relationship on my own. She says I’m being selfish and that it’s an important day for him too. My grandmother and aunts are on me because “he’s done so much for you” (he paid for me to go through university) and that I’m just making a big deal out of nothing and being difficult. I am an only child so they’re pointing out how all my cousins had their fathers walk them down the aisle as evidence that I’ll hurt my fathers feelings if he doesn’t walk me down the aisle.

My father just made one passive aggressive comment along the lines of “you always do what you want and don’t care about anyone else.” My fiancé supports me because he’s seen how tough my relationship is with my dad and how my parents don’t see how strained the relationship is. I offered to do a father daughter dance but my dad said don’t bother because I obviously don’t care about him. 

I honestly don’t want to hurt his feelings or cause drama but this is also a really big deal to me. I don’t want to give in just because everyone thinks he’s entitled to something that I don’t think he is.",False,False
1,"AITA for asking my son's tutor to change her hairstyle? | We recently hired a home tutor for our 10 year old son. This tutor, Mary(not real name) was introduced by my friend, who had her son taught by her too. However, I have a problem with the way she dresses. Mary is a splitting image of my grade school teacher back in my school days. Her facial features, her clothing style, hairstyle and everything.


Ms Lim, my grade school teacher at that time was my living nightmare. She understood her students well and knew just how to make them suffer so that she could control them. One such case was that she snapped off the branches on my flower plant when I brought it to school to show off to my classmates how well it bloomed. She did so in front of me 1 by 1 till the plant was all but a stick. Unfortunately during those days kids don't report their teachers to their parents, for fearing further punishments.


Well I do know that Mary isn't Ms Lim, the sight of her brought back the chill in my heart and made me very uncomfortable, especially seeing that she was to teach my son. The most significant similarity was the way she wear her braids, which is quite uncommon nowadays.


I brought this up to my husband and suggested that we change a tutor, but he shut me down and said that I was being silly and overreacting over nothing. Mary's reviews were good and her rates were better than most home tutors.


Mary makes me uncomfortable, and I know this is not her fault. I feel my heart tighten every time I leave her alone with my son. A few days ago, I mastered some courage over my fear and had a talk with Mary. I told Mary about how I felt and asked if she could maybe change the way she dresses or styles her hair when she comes to our place in future. Mary said she understood and asked me not to worry.


The next time Mary showed up, she looked completely different - she cut her hair. Her braid which once extended to her hips, all shortened to a bob cut, I did not expected to cut her hair. After telling my friend about this, she became angry and said that I was way out of line and shouldn't have even suggested it. My husband also disagreed with me and said that I was wrong to tell a person to change their looks. I feel so sorry right now, but indeed, Mary does not look like Ms Lim anymore and I am much more comfortable in her presence. AITA?",False,False
0,"WIBTA if reported Zumba class to property mgmt? | Okay, was mid-angry email when I realized I’m probably being a hater. However, I believe I have some valid safety concerns.

So the work gym: You’re getting the essentials that you’d see from a regular gym. Except there are no “studio” rooms meant for dancing, cardio classes (kickboxing, Zumba), doing back flips, etc . So as you’d imagine the space is considerably “intimate”. There is just enough room for a couple bikes, treadmills, ellipticals, and a free weight area with a couple benches. For the most part it’s just elderly people on stationary bikes, or they are doing free weight work outs and everyone is wearing headphones. Everyone tends to go at lunch time, so 11-12pm or 12-1.pm 

However, now on Monday-Friday there is a separate office of middle aged sales people that come down to the gym in groups of 7-9 people . They will move all of the benches for people to sit down on into the back of the gym but in between the weight machines. This is preventing people from using those machines and blocking the walk ways. So often times we just can’t use those machines. They put down a speaker and blast what sounds like pop and latin Music and start this intense dancing and jumping. My issue is that it feels unsafe because of the tight spacing and the fact that they wear jeans and hard toed shoes while doing this. 

Apparently, they are doing their form of Zumba. This isn’t a community class and hasn’t been authorized by management. It’s their own office rec. activity. And I have checked (with out snitching), and they were never given a green light to do this. They also never move the equipment back where it belongs and other staff and myself have to push the benches back into place and they leave sweaty towels on the floor for the janitor to pick up. Meanwhile, the laundry bin is 3 feet away. 

What irritates me the most(if I’m being honest anyway) is the loud fucking music. You are basically 5 feet away from full blast speaker belting out Pit-bull and Destiny’s Child and even my noise canceling headphones get some bleed through from it.  I can feel the vibrating and floors shaking as they jump about. 

I want to report safety concerns to the property managers but I’m also all about people getting fit and doing their thing their own way. 

I tend to try and slip around them but the other staff who change out and come down tend to just leave and return to work because there’s literally no access to anything until they are done. Which is usually about an hour &amp;amp; 20 minute wait.",False,False
0,"AITA for spending money on myself and not buying bday presents for my family? | My stepmom has a pretty big family. Her sister, niece, father and I all have birthdays in August within a week of each other so usually one big party is thrown for us and we all open gifts.

Now I’m in a weird spot in my life. I’ll be turning 24 this Friday. I just moved into my first apartment with my boyfriend and am still adjusting to spending this much money on rent/utilities. I’m paying of A LOT of credit card/student debt that accumulated from a lot of circumstances, but now that I have my first decently paying job, I’ve been making progress paying it off and I’m really proud of myself. However money is still a little tight for me.

Knowing this I asked my stepmom if I could contribute a little bit to a gift for everyone together because I didn’t feel I could afford to get everyone something. She said not to worry, she would put my name on what she got them and it would be a “family gift.” And that was the end of it.

I have been saving a little money but after the party I ended up spending a pretty decent chunk of change ($100) on a high end pillow because I have neck/back problems and keep waking up unable to move my neck. I also spend money ($64) on skincare stuff because my skin is really sensitive and I was having a hard time finding cheap stuff that worked for me.

I feel really guilty spending the money I saved on myself and not buying birthday presents for my family members. My cousin is planning her wedding in Cancun for next year, which I know is expensive for her and she’s on a budget and she still bought everyone something. AITA for doing this?

So my son spent the night last night with me because his mother had plans, I pick him up and we have a fun night and apparently what she had sent with him was; bacon super noodles, cheetos, a small pot of fruit, a small salad and a can of  coke.


Firstly; he's 11, far too young to drink fizzy drinks in my opinion and I feel as though we should have a conversation about that, so I gave him some fresh juice instead (he flipped over that) 

Secondly what kind of meal is noodles and cheetos? (Yes, he wanted them mixed) he should be having well balanced meals.

When I phoned her she told me that every so often   they do ""*lazy meals*"" and that our son absolutely loves them.

I told her next time to send him with some balanced meals.

I got married last Saturday. Hooray for me! My sister was my maid of honor. During her speech, she brought up her depression and how my husband supported her through it and how “in that moment, I knew he was the one for throwaway...” (so cliche!). I thought her speech was really selfish. I think it’s super inappropriate to bring up a mental illness during a wedding speech. Not only that, but the entire speech was about her. At MY wedding. 90% of the guests congratulated her afterwards and talked about how “strong” she was. Nobody was paying attention to me, at my own wedding! Sorry if I sound selfish, but IMO there is a time and a place for this sort of thing. So after the guests all greeted her, I asked her to leave and told her she was being disruptive and selfish.

I tell him that I am watering the plants. 

He responds with, it looks like you are dropping ice cubes into each of the plants.

He said, sure go for it.

He responded with, it freezes.

I then asked, what happens to ice when it gets too warm?

He said, it melts.

0,"WIBTA if I say No to boss trying to limit my only benefit? | I work at a small company that doesn't provide me any traditional benefits: no insurance of any kind, no 401k, no vacation, no sick leave, no paid holidays, nothing. When I started, this was all spelled out clearly, and I'm in a position where it wasn't a problem. The only 'benefit' I get is the ability to take (unpaid) time off whenever I want, make my own hours, and work from home a few days a week. At first, I had a limited role, worked 25 hours per week, and it was no issue to be as flexible as possible. My boss made it perfectly clear that she didn't care when I worked, as long as I got things done.

Since I've started, we've grown. From the full staff being just myself and the president, we now also have a part time assistant, and an intern. My responsibilities have grown, and I'm now in the office 4 days a week, and WFH one. I'm working more like 35 hours, and obviously cannot be quite as flexible as I was before. I get my work done, and have grinned and borne it as the president keeps giving me work I don't want that takes me away from my main responsibilities. To note, I still have no benefits.

Recently, I made an appointment, and put it on the calendar about 3 weeks in advance. I specified that I'd be WFH that morning and afternoon to accommodate. My intern was not scheduled to be in that day. This has been pretty standard, and I didn't think anything of it. However, the president just tried to have a talk with me saying that now I should make any appointments or personal things that would pull me away from work on my WFH day, and need her permission to take any time on days I am scheduled to be in the office. I waffled, but I'm honestly a bit upset. 

It frustrates me that after dumping work on me that she knows I don't want, and telling me I'm only getting a cost of living raise this year despite more and more responsibility that the president is now also trying to limit my only benefit. She's also not bothering to try to provide any sort of alternative compensation or benefit. 

WIBTA to tell her no? That while I always do my best to provide notice, and talk through conflicts, I'm not going to give up the only benefit I get from this role? Short of one emergency, I've never taken time off without ample notice, I am mindful of my responsibilities, and don't abuse the flexibility. We've had the additional staff since last spring, so I don't know why my taking any time has suddenly become problematic to her.

I told her that I don't have a problem with that. As long as she is happy, I am happy for her. She said that she is in love with her boyfriend and the new guy friend.

She never would have seen it coming that he would just break up. I am confused and say that I am not so shocked, because he already said yesterday that he isn't sure. She calls me heartless bitch and that she definitly never thought that he would break up. She also claims to have a heart attack.

Me: i don't really know what to apologize for. I stand by what i said. It was not a sudden shock to you. You knew before that he could break up. He even said that he wasn't sure. But i understand that the timing wasn't right for me to say that. So i apologize for saying that straight away when you were very emotional. I should have talked to you about that at a later point.

Her: that's not what you did wrong. It was a sudden break up. I didn't know that he would even consider breaking up. I could have never guessed that! Why are you in his side?

Me: that is just not the truth. When you told me that you are poly you said you were worried how he would react. And when you told him, he said he needs time to think about it. To me it was pretty clear that he could break up with you. And to be honest, i can understand him. Apparently he doesn't want an open relationship and so he rather breaks it up with you than to keep a relationship going that would make both of you unhappy. Maybe it is better that way.

1,"AITA for asking my fiancee/girlfriend [28F] to work 80 hours a week in order to pay off her debt in time for our marriage? | I have been doing the same thing since last November.

I have $70K in debt, all of it student loans. I got a second job. It will take me until the beginning of next year to pay off my debt.  I am looking at working about 80 hours making $130K. It sucks, but I realized I am not going to get out of debt quickly any other way.

She has around $60K debt.  She financed her father's treatment for cancer (who is thankfully in remission) on credit card.

She works as a teacher working 60-65 hours a week making around $65K. I told her if she works another 15 hours tutoring people she can easily make $15K-$20K. She can easily be debt free in around 18 months. If she gets another job or starts tutoring people, I can help her and she'll be done quicker.

She is calling me an asshole because she already ""compromised"" by agreeing to do a budget.

I told her doing a budget means nothing if we are not cutting our spending and increasing our income.

She said that working 80 hours a week will be bad for her mental health (she has a history of depression).

I told her that I had/have depression (as diagnosed by the doctor).  If I can do it, she can as well. I also told her that her mental health will be worse with the debt hanging like an albatross on her neck. Hell, paying of debt is important for my mental health because it is stressing me out.

She resents the fact that she, in her words, ""never sees me"" and that this will hurt our relationship.

I told her that if we didn't figure out our debt problems, we would definitely get divorced because money problems cause fights.

She said I was a asshole and cheapskate because I am demanding we reduce our spending on food by not going out, not eating fancy stuff like avocado, and not spending money on Netflix. Currently, we are paying $450.  She thinks that $350 per month on groceries between the both of us is too low.  It isn't.

Breakfast: Milk and banana ($0.40)

Lunch: spaghetti ($2) or salad ($3.50).

0,"AITA for declining to participate in any food-centric socialization at work? | I have encountered a work issue I never saw coming. I'm 28 and work as an administrative assistant. A few times there have been events like a going away party, or Halloween or Thanksgiving, and the whole deal is getting the office staff together for in-office parties or whatever and there's cake and ice cream or other things and it's just very food centered. 

Simply put, I developed an eating disorder when I was a teenager and ever since, I have avoided any kind of food centric parties or events. They just make me incredibly uncomfortable and anxious. So what I used to do was join in and just not eat, but that would always upset people. I'd try to stand around with a diet coke and people would constantly shove food at me and stare at me and watch until I took a bite or two. 

I started declining the events and coming up with meetings to cover for it so I could leave, take a walk, or even just take my lunch as usual. That doesn't fly at this current job. They'll always be like ""Oh well we'll reschedule for when you're available!"" and ""Well you can still join us when you get back, that kind of meeting won't take long!""

Obviously I'd get caught in these lies, so this past time, I told the event organizer that I would decline, period. I thought they wouldn't need reasons, but I was hounded. Why not? When could I? Why don't I ever come? I finally said that I just didn't want to. She took great offense to this and has started telling people that I think I'm took good for them and that I'm stuck up.

Everything's been nearly perfect, but over the last 8 months my SO has got REALLY into eating a lot of yogurt, which ya know - I'm fine with, its their life, but the side-effects have been really getting to me Reddit...

The excess protein is giving them TERRIBLE gas, to the point where I honestly thought we may have had a small rodent die in our condo but turned out they'd just passed wind, plus it is really throwing us off our weekly macros that we carefully meal-prep for.

He is dyslexic and has always struggled to hold a job because of his behavior. A few weeks ago he told me that his work would not accommodate his disability or let him transfer to other roles. I told him he should file an EEOC complaint and he asked if I could write one for him because of his awful grammar & spelling. I said sure. I didn’t tell my wife because I knew she would be really angry I helped out my brother, who has called us shitty people who never help him out and worse names when we pushed him for more proof on his cancer “exaggeration”.

Some where a whole decade older but my mom really bonded with the them. 

The relief program is involved in this conversation that we are in right now and we are always stopped by these girls. I don’t care when they stop and say hi but sometimes we’ll stand for HOURS. They’ll always talk to her and encourage her lazy work ethic for college (I mean to ask about that in a different post) and completely disregard me. My mom always worries about their mental health and how they’re doing but has been screaming “i don’t care” for the past 4 years whenever I talk to her about my mental health.

Last night we went out to eat and they nearly forgot me. My mom kept making me go to get the things they needed and asked me to order mozzarella sticks and the instant I left she leaned forward to the girls and started whispering. You’re 40 years old, why are you acting like you’re 14. Not only that but they didn’t sell mozzarella sticks and I got embarrassed. I got upset and told her to check next time. 

She made me baby sit my sister so she can hang out with girls half her age at the bazaar. I have friends who are older than me and can be my mother but my mom gets angry when I hang out with them. 

She acts completely different around them and always glares at me to shut up. She acts all “sassy” and “strong independent woman-like”. She was talking about how she wanted to become a therapist because people already come to her to talk so she “might as well start charging them” and said how she wanted to help teens. Which is ironic because she’s straight up said that she doesn’t care about my anxiety attacks and how I’ve been told by two doctors to go to a psychiatrist and said that “it’s a phase” (it’s been 4 years) and that I just need to wait one more year. 

I confronted her about it and she said that they’re happy to see her and smiling and that’s why she likes them. I’m just bitter that I’ve known this woman for 16 years and our relationship is SHIT. While she’s met these girls for a few months and they speak so highly of her and how kind and caring she was to them. She hugs them more than she hugs me. I don’t care if she’s friends with them, I’m just embarrassed that I feel like she cares more about them. It’s like she’s completely given up on our relationship and is just having “new daughters”.

When I opened my WhatsApp, lo and behold, pictures of me standing in the line in the store. She sent them to my dad. He was mad, rightfully so, but he got over it eventually. 

I contacted head office of this store, and they sent the case back to the branch manager. She called me today to hear my story. I didn't give a name, on purpose, but then she figured it out; she said that the girlfriend would be suspended until such a time that I can go back home (I'm in another city rn) and give a statement in a hearing for this lady. 

Ayt, cool. So my dad calls me, and he's absolutely losing his shit, throwing all kinds of emotional blackmail out in the air. At the end of the call he said that I have 24 hours to withdraw the complaint, or he will tell everybody in our family that I have turned against him.

0,"AITA for reporting a theft to HR even though the items stolen weren’t worth very much? | First time posting so please bear with me. Excuse the grammar, spelling and typos, I’m on a mobile.
I work at a massage clinic as a massage therapist. We have had several issues this year with theft by employees. Not only theft of our cash tips but money from the register and items left by clients in the lost and found in the office safe. We do have cameras in the lobby, the office and the break room.  
After I came back to work after my weekend, I noticed that in my cubby spot that hangs on the wall, a few very low value items are missing. Several of us have this item at work. I bring it up to a person at the front desk who said that along with my items the others that were found were turned in to the manager. Everyone but me had their items returned. These items are not prohibited in any way. 
Now, I fully understand that the items in question are very inexpensive but the fact is I feel violated for having my possessions taken from me. So on our office group chat, I asked that my items be returned by Friday or I will report the theft to HR.  Well, Friday came and my items were not returned so I reported the theft to HR.  
So my boss never confronted me about the group chat post and was well aware of the missing items but didn’t seem to concerned about it until I reported it to HR. Now my boss is telling me I’m threatening people and offered to pay for my missing items. I told him no. That theft is theft regardless of the value of the item stolen. He thinks Im blowing this way out of proportion and maybe I am, but considering how poorly he handled previous thefts, I have lack of faith that he can/will handle this appropriately. 
For those of you who might ask why I don’t keep belongings in a locker. I do not bring anything to work that i would need to keep that safe. I keep my ID on me and only deal in cash so I don’t have a debit card. I have no reason to take up a whole locker.

1,"AITA for telling my cousin that her flirtatious hair flipping makes me uncomfortable? | Hey yo. So my cousin (19F) has been staying at our house for like a month now. In the house are me (17M), my brother (20M), my parents, and my grandma. I’ll admit right now that I’m a bit narcissistic. I think pretty much every girl is into me. I’m usually pretty accurate though, according to my friends. My narcissism isn’t unfounded though. I was the starting shooting guard on the varsity basketball team and I’m good-looking. My brother on the other hand is more average. 


One thing that has been irking me lately is my cousin’s flirtatious hair flipping, where she runs her hand through her long hair ad cranks her neck sideways and back or just shakes her head left to right to get her hair flowing. This seems like a new habit. She does this tens of times a day. I never really got the feeling that she was into me before, but it sure seems like it now. It might be because I’m more mature now. She seems to be very enthralled in whatever I have to say and she’s always hanging out with me whenever I’m outside my room. I don’t mind that. I just don’t like it when she makes her flirting so obvious, à la the flirtatious hair flipping. A few times a day when I’m in her presence, she would do the hair flipping. It makes me very uncomfortable. She would also do it sometimes when other family members are around, but I notice it more often when it’s just her and I. 


While just her and I were in the living room yesterday diddling on our phones, I noticed her flirtatiously hair flipping six times in an hour. It happened four times while we were talking and she was sure she had my attention. I told her after the sixth time that her flirtatious hair flipping makes me uncomfortable. She asked me what the hell I was talking about. I explained to her that she’s doing what most girls do when they’re into a guy and it’s very uncomfortable for me so she should stop. She said I’m full of myself and to stop being so god damn gross. I asked her why she was flipping her hair then. She said girls do that more often than I think and not for the reason that I think. I asked her what the reason was then. She said it’s just to make sure her hair is in order. I said okay incredulously. We were sitting awkwardly in silence for the next hour. I didn’t notice her flipping her hair. 


She told my brother about this incident when he came over. My brother said he couldn’t believe that I actually thought our cousin was flipping her hair because of me. I asked him why he couldn’t believe that. He said it’s because she’s our fucking cousin who has a boyfriend and that I’m not as hot as I think I am. I didn’t want to get into a competition with him because I like to show respect to my elders, but I’m legit a 9 and he’s like a 7.

So just casually yesterday in the car, I said to him ""you know, son, you can start to call me dad if you'd like. You're getting older and I think it would be more age-appropriate and describes our relationship more accurately.""

He seemed taken aback and embarrassed and murmured an ""OK"" before sitting quietly for the rest of the ride. I told my wife what happened, and she thinks it was unnecessary and that it was clearly embarrassing to call him out like that on something so minor. I agreed that it wasn't some major deal, but I just thought that the time had come for him to start calling me ""dad"" and broaching the subject openly and honestly with him is the best way.

I live with my parents so they are well aware of my diet. 

Anyway, last week my mom started discussing the thanksgiving menu. She said she planned to make a roast turkey, sausage stuffing, mashed potatoes (butter/milk) and then asked me if I would make some sides as well. I told her sure, I guess I could roast some vegetables alongside some meatless chicken tenders in the oven. She got really offended and said “really? You’re going to sit at thanksgiving dinner with a frozen meal and a chip on your shoulder?” I was kind of taken off guard because my mom is more than used to me cooking dinner for myself. I typically cook with a lot whole Foods and make more elaborate salads, stews, pasta dishes, etc. but since my mom is going to be cooking all day I just figured I’d keep it simple. 

I eventually asked her, point blank, what exactly she wanted me to do. Did she want me to eat her roast turkey? Because that’s not something I want to do. She said no, she didn’t expect that, but I could at least put the effort into making myself a presentable meal for thanksgiving.

0,"AITA for making a stink about traveling with our 4 month old for Christmas? | First time SAHM to my 4 month old son. MIL is insisting that we all fly to visit my husband's extended family for their Christmas (the 28th). I am super reluctant to travel, given the germy-ness, expense, inconvenience of lugging stuff, and the fact that my otherwise loveable 4 month old is prone to meltdowns (as 4 month olds often are). I am the primary caregiver, have done 99% of the night shifts, and am the de facto baby wrangler when baby is losing his shit, as he often does because he nearly never naps and totally refuses a pacifier or bottle (we're exclusively breastfeeding). I am exhausted most days and haven't slept for more than 4 hours at a stretch in probably 6 months.

Spending 4 hours in a germ-filled tube with a possibly inconsolable baby to go hang out in freezing weather (in-laws are in WI, we're in AZ), only to have my new baby passed around at a 20 person Christmas sounds like torture to me. Not to mention they have 3 (albeit small) dogs and an endless stream of visitors, family aside.

Husband has some legitimate reasons for wanting to go, like rarely getting time off, spending time with his family, and introducing everyone to the new baby. Hubby would likely not press the issue if it weren't for the guilting. My otherwise great pre-baby MIL is (understandably) finding it difficult not to be close to her first grandchild, but has put constant pressure on us about flying to visit (and has for months - since I was 3 months pregnant). She has put on the waterworks, talked about baby ""forgetting"" them, and various other guilt trips. She constantly talks about getting a ""do over"" with this baby, has insinuated that I'm a shut in for not dragging my baby around town at 1 month, and has done things like let my baby become so hungry (because she insisted on babysitting despite me telling her he doesn't take a bottle) that she allowed him to suck on her arm until it was bruised.

After a big argument with husband I allowed myself to be forced into going, but not without explaining that I absolutely did NOT want to do it and that I'd be setting clear boundaries for trip expectations. I plan on making the most of the trip, but also letting MIL know that her behavior is completely unacceptable. This experience has made me not want to travel for the next couple years, until kiddo can actually remembee and enjoy the trip (though she's welcome to come visit).

And he encountered several ''CPS types'' who act righteous but then go quiet when the guy claims to be a Mafiosa.

I start smiling and my sister gets more scared, the dude fesses up and says ''Relax, its just a prank. There's a camera over there'' and my sister is relieved.

Cool, we all agreed that if someone is too hot, they open the window in their room to let in the freezing air outside. Glad we could agree.

I noticed a week later that in the mornings I was waking freezing in a bed covered in 3+ blankets. I told my friend about how I keep finding the A/C dial moved to halfway or all the way ""Cold"". She casually told me that when her boyfriend comes over, it’s too hot to sleep, so she and he have been moving it down at night. I was baffled. She and I just told other people to stop freezing us, and she turned around and was the one doing it now!

This started in January. I asked her at least twice a week to stop for reasons including:

1. We told the other girls not to make it cold, so you shouldn't do it.
2. They agreed to open their windows if its too hot, why can't you?
3. I don't sleep in pajamas, maybe you guys should try sleeping with no blankets or clothes to reduce how hot you get.

1. But I can't sleep when it's hot, and someone keeps turning it up in the morning, so then I wake up. (Plot twist I was the one who was turning it back up to half way)
2. Well <boyfriend> said that if we do that then the heat is just going to turn on more often, so I figured it isn't worth trying it out. (There’s no way of knowing where the temperature reader is)
3. Maybe sleep with more clothes on? I've slept in long sleeves and pants since I was little, and I'm not going to change now. (So why do I have to change?)

Fast forward a month, and I was convinced by my boyfriend to buy a space heater because this petty argument is not worth having for 3 more months. Now I'm comfy and warm in my room regardless of what the other girls adjust the A/C to. I even had a conversation with her about why I bought the heater, and she said she felt bad.

Today, she messaged me and said something along the lines of ""ugh <boyfriend> and I didn't even sleep together last night, and the other girls turned the A/C all the way cold. so annoyed with them making it cold all the time"". I just froze. Was she seriously complaining about other people making it cold in the house at night when she ignored my complaints for a month?

I responded ""Well I unfortunately have no sympathy for you when it comes to the A/C bc you and <boyfriend> forced me to adapt to the cold, so the cold no longer effects me and I dont care about it anymore.""

I don’t play as much as him and definitely know nothing about programming so it’s hard to say what would be good and bad for a certain amount of time spent, but he’s been spending a good 3-4 hours a day for the past two weeks on it.

Today he asked me to come look at it, and it was just a tiny little platform you could run around on and clicking made a little ball come out of the guy and go forward. There was only one enemy and it just walked around randomly. He asked how it looked and I was honest and said it looked terrible, and asked if he spent the past two weeks working just for that. 

He got mad and said it’s still a prototype and most of what he was doing was foundation stuff that you can’t see. He was really mad and so I said that I didn’t know why he would ask how it looked knowing that most of the work wasn’t visible and I don’t know how making a game works.

He got pissed and said that he doesn’t know why I ask about my drawings because he doesn’t really like art. I don’t really think it’s the same thing because you can see everything that happens to a drawing.

So I decided to tattoo it for him while he was sleeping with some stick and poke. It didn’t come out perfect but I had thought that he would love it even more since I was the one who gave it to him.

0,"AITA for refusing to work with an autistic student? | Repost to add some info
I (22f) study CS at uni. I am in my second year because I took a few gap years to figure out what I want to do with my life. I decided that it was CS that I wanted to do and here I am in my second year. I'm not a genius but I take my studies very seriously and try to max out every learning opportunity. 

There is a guy who was in one of my classes last year and he is o the autism spectrum. If you know Sheldon from the big bang theory then you can imagine what this guy is like. Last semester I did a group project with him and he is a genius when it comes to CS. However, working with him was a nightmare. He would make it very obvious that he thought I was bad at what I do, ignored all of my suggestions and edited my part of the project only hours before we had to had it in. 

So this semester we have to do another group project this time with assigned partners and because I was unlucky I got him again plus another girl who seems nice enough. I decided there's no way I'm doing another project with him and asked the prof if I could switch groups. She said yes but I would have to tell the rest of my group. So I did and while the guy didn't seem to care the girl asked me why. So I told her that the guy and I aren't compatible and that I felt disrespected the whole time we worked together. This apparently made her want to switch groups as well and now I'm the arsehole who isolates autistic students. 
I feel bad but at the same time my issue with him wasn't his disability but the lack of respect he showed me even after I tried to talk to him and explain where I'm coming from. 

So please reddit tell me AITA

Additional info: I did adress the issue with him last semester but he didn't really care. I was very direct but he said that he prefers working by himself and will therefore not meet with me. I then did my half of the project which he changed and then handed in.",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I sold someone else's prom dress and didn't tell them? | I am in my second year of university, and the prom dress in question is the one I wore to my senior ball about two years ago. I rented the dress from a high school acquaintance for $100 (I believe she paid $400-500 for it when she bought it for her junior prom). 

After the dance, I got the dress dry cleaned and texted her asking when she wanted it back, and I'm pretty sure she said something along the lines of ""whenever, there's no rush."" I tried to find a time to bring it to her but we were both busy and it didn't work out, so I put it in my closet and kinda forgot about it for the summer. In August, I realized I still had the dress so I texted her and asked if we could hang out before she left for college, so that I also could return the dress. No reply.

She never texted me about it again and we haven't talked since then, which was over a year and a half ago. At this point, the dress has been taking up space in my closet and hasn't been used at all. I want to sell the dress or at least rent it out for next prom season (since this one has sorta been canceled).

Obviously I could text her and ask if she wants it back first, but I am sorta inclined at this point to just sell/rent out the dress, since I feel like I put in the effort to give it back and she never seemed to care, she is going to school out of state so I'm not even sure when/if she will be in our hometown, and it has been taking up my closet space forever.

1,"AITA for being mad my girlfriend didn’t tell me about her history of depression | I’ve been dating this girl Eve for 6 months. We met on a dating app. The relationship has been amazing, the best relationship I’ve ever had and she’s a great girl. I did notice she had a few odd habits. Not super strange but some things I noticed: 

She’s obsessed with everything being clean and perfect hygiene, 
She insists on going to bed no later than midnight. If we’re out, she insists she has to get home before 11:30 even on the weekends.
She refuses to sleep with her phone in the room and charges it in the kitchen (even though she has roommates).  
She has this super bright “therapy lamp” by her desk that is supposed to simulate the sunlight and “makes her feel better”. 
 She is a super healthy eater who likes to eat at exact the same time every day 
 She takes like 8 different medications in the morning (she said most of them were supplements)

None of this really affected our relationship and I assumed she was just a really organized person. 

Last weekend we were out at this fancy club for one of her friend’s birthday. We were having a really fun time but then at 11:15 she said she had to go and get to bed. I was a bit disappointed since we were having fun but I offered to go with her. She said I could stay and she didn’t want to bother me since she was just going to sleep.  

After she leaves I start talking to Eve’s friend Lea and joke about how Eve sleeps so early. Lea laughs and then says she thinks she started doing it as part of her mental health recovery.  I had no idea what she was talking about and ask her what she’s talking about. Lea was surprised that I didn’t know and starts telling me about how Eve really struggled in the past with severe depression and basically dropped out of college and stopped talking to everybody for years. People thought she had disappeared. Around 2 years ago she started reconnecting with all her friends and telling them about her struggles with depression and how she was doing therapy and seeing a psychiatrist. She soon started school again and became really obsessive about doing everything perfectly but she’s doing so well now. Lea acted like it was no big deal but that it was weird I didn’t know since most people knew. 

I was shocked. The next day I “confront” Eve about why she never told me about her past with depression. She gets really defensive and just goes on about how Lea is an “obnoxious gossip who never shuts up”. I’m pretty angry at this point because she’s talking about her friend gossiping instead of her keeping a huge secret from me. She says I’m being an asshole and have no right to be mad and that she was “obviously going to tell me” and that she was just scared and waiting for the right moment. She then insisted that she’s better now so it doesn’t matter anyway. However, my aunt had depression and I KNOW it’s never really “cured,” I think I had a right to know earlier in the relationship.

1,"AITA for dropping my husband's free drone from a raffle? | My husband works for a tech company and won a free non-branded drone at work during a raffle.  The drone is cheap (< $100) and we already own a DJI drone, so he probably intended on regifting this free drone he got.  

As I was carrying it out of the car for him, all the contents in the box fell out while I carried it by the handle.  The box is crappy, the cover was closed by tape and the tape had lost all adhesive so it was worthless.  I was carrying a ticking time bomb like Kevin Durant's achilles's tendon and everything came crashing out.  

When it happened, I automatically played it off as not my fault, the box was crappy and disregarded it since it was a) cheap and b) free.  My husband immediately proceeds to flip his shit because of how I responded to dropping the drone, not the fact that I dropped the drone.  He says I did not treat his property with any care, respect, and did not own up to my mistakes whether he paid for the drone, gifted the drone, or won it for free.  He says I do this all the time with his other possessions, not treating his stuff with the proper care and respect.

I cut him out of my life, went FULL no contact since he was a real bastard and I found it incredibly creepy that he was now ""dating"" someone that was basically my age. I haven't kept up with his life, I made it really clear to everyone in my family at the time, I want nothing to do with him and if they wanted me to still come to family things on my dad's side, that was my condition.

Everyone respected my boundaries, until recently. 

Turns out, Sperm Donor got married to his 25 yr old GF, and had a kid. But surprise, surprise, their massive age gap relationship wasn't all roses and they got divorced pretty quickly later. Not my problem, but now ex-Wife is getting remarried and gave Sperm Donor full custody over their 5 yr old. Sperm Donor was a pretty shitty parent with us, so unsurprisingly, I doubt he's too keen to be a single dad at near 60. 

Here's the problem. Gran and Auntie want me to ""develop a relationship"" with the five year old half sibling. It's still my ""blood"" apparently. I want nothing to do with his midlife crisis lovechild, and neither does my brother. And honestly, to me, it feels like Sperm Donor is just trying to get free babysitting/weasel his way into our lives again. I've lived through seven years without him, and I'm happy to die this way.

1,"AITA for arguing with my wife over the fact that she keeps breaking our children's stuff | We have two children; a boy (Jay) and a girl (Leah). These are obviously not their real names. Jay is 12 and Leah is 15. So, let me start this off by saying that me and my wife live a very comfortable life. Basically, we've worked hard our entire lives and got promoted till we got to this point where we make enough money to support a ""lavish"" lifestyle. I'm merely mentioning this because I believe that this fact is the core of our problem.

What I mean by that is that our income is giving some leeway for their mom to break their stuff. She often breaks their stuff when they misbehave, spend too much time on them or get bad grades. Now I believe that there should be some sort of punishment for when these stuff happen. Taking their stuff away for a while would be an okay punishment. However, breaking their stuff is extreme and wasteful. Moreover, when I say their stuff, I'm talking about Leah's phone (which costed a hair over $1000) and Jay's latest gaming console.

Lately, Jay and Leah have been doing a lot of things that irked their mother. So, yesterday their mother had reached her boiling point and she smashed Leah's phone by throwing it full force at the floor, and she cut Jay's PS4 cords. I suppose that Jay's predicament was far better than that of his sister, mostly since their mom didn't know how to break a PS4.

I was out when she'd done all that. My kids told me once I arrived. I was annoyed. However, I stood by their mother's side and basically defended her actions. Once we were alone, I told her that she should stop breaking stuff. 

She said that they deserve it and should start listening to her if they want to keep their stuff. I told her that she could've just taken them and hidden them somewhere. She said she didn't want them to have hope of having it back anytime soon. Basically we've argued on and on for an hour or so and haven't reached any compromise yet.

Their mom does this about twice a year, and she ends up buying them their stuff back when they've fixed their act. It's also fair to mention that these outbursts are unplanned. She just loses it and breaks their stuff. She does have anger issues but never with me.",False,False
0,"AITA for moving out to live with my aunts? | I am fifteen. Five years ago, my parents died in car accident and since then, I’ve been living with my grandparents (my mom’s parents). I am very thankful I was able to live with them. I love them dearly and we are quite close.

Over the summer, I spent a month with my aunts (my dad’s sisters). When my parents died, they wanted to take me in, but I ended up living with my grandparents instead. My aunts still visited me a lot, and I visited them a lot, but this summer was the first time I stayed with them for a month straight. 

I did a lot of stuff while visiting my aunts. One of them gave me a job at her bakery, and I loved helping and earning money. They taught me to drive, which my grandparents said I couldn’t do until I turn 18. I also started dating a guy who will be going to the local high school. I visited the high school and I loved it, it was so much bigger than the tiny school I went to last year near my grandparents, with a lot more class options and AP courses and extracurriculars. I also felt like I got to know my aunts a lot better, and they told me a lot of stories about my dad which I never knew before. 

My aunts always told me that their door is always open for me, and that I’m welcome any time. I told them that I wanted to move in with them, and they were thrilled. Then I told my grandparents and they were not thrilled, they seemed really upset. I didn’t really think about what it would mean for them if I moved out.

I’m worried that my grandparents feel threatened by my aunts or something. Since they’re from different sides, they don’t really know each other, I’m the only connection.

0,"AITA for being unhappy with a birthday present and confronting my family about it? | I know it sounds kinda stupid and petty and it is.

Today is my birthday and because I'm a minor I still live with my family. My parents always give me and my brother money for our birthdays so we can save and get something we really want. They will also give the other sibling money ahead of time so my brother and I can get each other small gifts. 

This morning I got a ton of birthday calls from family and a gift from my brother. He looked quite apprehensive about giving it to me and quietly explained he wasn't happy with the gift and didn't think I'd like it. It was a necklace that isn't the sort of thing I'd particularly like at all. In front of everyone I acted like I liked it but later on the way to school I talked to my brother about it. Turns out it was supposed to go to my brother's gf but they broke up so our mum made him give it to me instead even though everyone knew it'd be the sort of thing I'd hate. 

I messaged my mum letting her know I knew about this situation. I politely told her I was unhappy with the gift and I would prefer if it was given to someone else or returned and that my brother gets me a birthday present by himself. I made sure my message was a polite as it could be and that I didn't sound accusatory because I didn't want to start a fight over a bad gift. Well, that's kinda what happened. My mum messaged back defensive and annoyed because from her perspective it was a beautiful necklace that would go nicely with my dress for going out (it wouldn't at all for a plethora of reasons), it was more expensive than the allocated amount so I should be grateful, and it was bought overseas so they have no way to return it.

Now, I had no clue about the last few things. I just knew it was a necklace that was supposed to go to someone else and my brother tried to convince my mum I'd hate it and he should get me a gift in the price range that I'd like. My mum thinks I knew about the whole context and was being a spoilt brat about it all. Even though I didn't know about everything, I still kind of feel like TA for confronting my mum about a birthday gift I didn't pay for that cost more than normal and can't be returned but on the other hand I feel like my family (excluding my awesome brother) was being TA for forcing my brother to give me a gift I wouldn't like instead of letting him get me something himself.

0,"AITA for not wanting my mom to sue my dad for child support? | 
TLDR; dying father owes mom child support. He was going to leave my sister and I money but my mom wants to take the money for the back child support. AITA for being upset?


Mine (21 f) and my sister’s (24) mom and dad divorced when we were very young. I’ll admit my dad has been an asshole in the past, but they’ve always had a custody agreement. We would visit my dad most weekends and in between he would call and send cute letters and stuff. He has some issues such as temperament but it’s because when he was younger he got thyroid cancer after serving in the Air Force and they removed his whole thyroid and his meds don’t help a lot with keeping his hormones in balance. 

Anyways, he didn’t pay a lot of child support when I was growing up because he’s always been extremely poor. Not only that, but my mom had a huge problem with accruing debt. We lived with my grandma growing up and she would take out credit cards in my grandmas name, max them out, and then not pay them. She’d also buy a ton of clothes with the money that was supposed to go to bills, so occasionally our water or electricity would get shut off. So he didn’t want her to spend all that money on herself instead of us girls. 

A couple years ago she got my grandmas ( moms mom) house that we had lived in since I was 3 foreclosed on, even though it had a reverse mortgage. She didn’t have to pay on the mortgage all those years, she just wouldn’t pay the property tax until eventually they wanted a ton of money and she didn’t have it so it got foreclosed. 

So now, my dad has been diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer. He’s making all of his death arrangements while he’s been going through treatment.  

My mom told me that because my grandma on my dads side is so rich (and she also has stage 4 cancer in her breasts that metastasized to lungs and lymph nodes)  she’s going to try to take the money my dad owes her out of his inheritance from my grandma. 

I’m upset because not only is she trying to go after my dying father and grandmother, she would be taking the money that my dad was going to leave to my sister and I. I know it’s shitty that he didn’t pay his child support all the way but he’s been sending her $20 a month because that’s all he has now and he didn’t want to give it to her just for her to spend it on herself instead of us and the bills because she was doing a shitty job of taking care of us. 

I don’t want to be a spoiled brat and say “that’s my money!!” Because it’s not, but she’s trying to go after my dying father and grandmother that I love a lot. And also it just seems a little shitty to take your children’s inheritance,  even if that person owes you money.

They had already told me 2-3 months ago that they had a little crush on me but that it had faded away, and since then they've also had crushes on several different people.

It kind of broke my heart that my drawings were gone but I eventually accepted the fact that it was most likely gone forever. If only that was what actually happened. The next day, when I walked into school, E was showing off some drawings to R and L. I was happy for her until I realized that the drawings that she was showing off were mine! At first, I thought it was a joke. So I walked up to them and asked who's drawings they were. E looked me dead in the eye and told me they were hers. Even L and R backed her up. I reassured them that they were mine. But none of them would listen.  
I was starting to get tired of her bullshit so I got all up in her face.  
""Those are MY drawings!"" I yelled at her.  
""No, they aren't!""  
""Prove it!""  
""I do all of these from a youtube tutorial!""  
""Show me the video then!""  
""I forgot what video it was!""  
At this point in the argument, anyone with more than two brain cells could see that she was lying. But apparently R and L have none, and they yet again backed up E.

I was so angry at all of them, but I was also hungry. So I grabbed a milk carton and tiny container of cereal, whilst still yelling at E. I was going to sit down and eat, but R walk right up to me and blacked my way. She began to yell at me. And I don't know why, but that was the last straw. I was done with this bullshit. I squeezed my milk and cereal with quite a lot of force. And surprisingly, the milk busted, and it got all over R's shoes. She got furious with me, I don't know why they were cheap shoes. She looked like she was going to hit me. But I decided that I had done enough damage, and walked away from her, L, and E.  
\~\~\~

In present day, I'm kinda still ""friends"" with L and E. R moved and changed schools. I forgave L, but I still fucking hate E and R.

0,"AITA for not wanting every conversation with my husband to be a debate? | Okay I'm going to try to explain this as clearly as possible. 

Lately my husband has been ""playing the Devil's advocate"" in every conversation we have. If he had a horrible day at work and comes home and vents to me I generally end up on the ""boss man is an asshole train"" (because he fucking is). All of a sudden he will flip.and try to explain WHY his boss acted like a dick. 

Or when we were talking about the game we both have played our entire marriage. He will be complaining about the way the game has been broken during the latest expansion. I will join in and affirm that it's the reason I'm not playing anymore. Boom he flips and starts like defending the devs. 

It's driving me crazy and really makes me not want to talk to him. Like at all, it gets really old to have every word coming out of my mouth second guessed and picked apart.  I've told him how I feel about it but he says it's more fun to have conversations if everyone has different views and that I'm being too sensitive. He gets weirdly aggressive during these talks, nothing physical but like he makes shit way bigger than it really is. He gets really intense I guess is what I would explain it as. 

So, AITA for wanting my husband to change the way he's been communicating with me lately? Am I being too sensitive?",False,False
0,"AITA for sticking to my guns about the difference in what our work handbook says and what we actually do at work? | The handbook states “we will not potty train your child.” Clear as day, in bold. Twice. 

So I’m the preschool teacher, I remember being told at my interview that kids had to be potty trained to move up to the preschool class. There are 3 that aren’t. One is just straight up on diapers. One is in pull ups but really close to just wearing underwear and being 100% potty trained. The third one is neither. I’m basically expected to potty train her. Her parents complain about everything. They ask me to do things differently every week. My boss asked me to potty train her (teacher her to pull her pants up and down, sit on the potty, wipe, fish, all of it).

I just got another talking to about this kid and how I’m doing “enough” to help her. I explained how I was told things would be from the beginning. I explained how the interview and the handbook both said I wouldn’t be potty training kids. And I said they should change their handbook if they want me to change my classroom.

0,"AITA for telling people that I'm an orphan? | I'm female and young enough that people reasonably assume my parents are alive. They are not. For personal reasons I've cut the rest of my family off too, so I've been totally on my own since I was 19. Recently, I've started to wonder if letting people I'm not close with know this about me is some sort of huge social faux pas.

This mostly becomes an issue around the holidays where you're bombarded with smalltalk about what you'll be doing over break. ""Are you going back to your parents' house?"" is a common one -- if it's someone I don't really have any sort of relationship with at all I'll just answer something like ""nah, I'm just meeting up with friends"", but when I get these questions from people like classmates or colleagues on my immediately team at work I see every day I might try to gently say ""I'm on my own"" or ""no, I don't have much family"" or something like that.

My family history isn't super traumatizing for me to think about or anything, but I don't exactly enjoy having to field questions about my non-existent family either. So I'd like to let people I interact with frequently know this stuff so they at least know to avoid the topic with me. But they pretty much always react like I took a massive shit in the middle of the room whenever I say it.

One recent incident I've been dwelling on is this time I was talking to one of my supervisors (50s M), and he was offering me some advice about health care. He asked me something like ""are you still young enough to be on your parents' insurance"" -- I thought it was relevant so I said no, that's not an option for me since my parents are gone. He immediately got stopped up and acted like I'd said something inappropriate (he didn't chastise me, but it definitely felt like he thought I shouldn't have said it).

I really don't feel like I'm dropping nukes here with the way I phrase it (I try to keep it neither too heavy nor too flippant -- though I've TRIED saying it with a little sense of humor about it and that always went basically the same), but I've had enough of these hyper awkward interactions that it occurs to me I have no idea what the average person without a grimdark backstory considers appropriate social protocol here. I can get some degree of awkward response, but often it's clearly less of a ""oh, I feel bad for you and that makes me feel awkward"" reaction so much as it comes off like ""there's something wrong with you for sharing this information"".

AITA for being candid about my family situation? Should I just avoid ever actually telling non-close acquaintances that I have no family? Is it that people expect me to be \*more\* heavy about it than I typically am?? I honestly have no idea how to navigate this sort of thing.

Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.

0,"AITA for taking my neighbors laundry out? | I live in a five floor apartment building that's connected directly to the tower next door, with shared trash and laundry in the basement of my tower. There are four washers and four dryers. This morning I went downstairs to do my laundry, and it was my first time doing it in this new place. At first when I went downstairs, I mistakenly put all of my laundry into one of the dryers, instead of the washers, because everything is front-loading, and at my old place the setup was opposite of this laundry room. Then a guy came in and started to move his laundry over, so I panicked, because I'm not very good under embarrassing situations, and I went back up to my apartment and came back down to pretend like I'd forgotten something.
 
 When I came back down there was another lady in the laundry room, who had two very small baskets of laundry. At this point, one of the one of the washers was in use, and she was just kind of standing there looking at all of her laundry. It was pretty mixed stuff, but nothing that struck me particularly as whites, or anything that would have to be washed on its own. I realized in that moment I would have to embarrassedly move my stuff from the dryer to the washer in front of somebody, so it may as well be this lady. I made the comment, ""Oh, haha, I accidentally put all my stuff in the dryer not even realizing it wasn't the washer.""

I started quickly moving my stuff from the dryer to the washer, and when I looked up it had quarters on it, which as you may know, means someone has reserved it. Fine, there's two other open washers. I ask, ""Oh, sorry, are you going to use this one?"" She responds, ""I actually need three of them."" My jaw dropped. ""You need THREE of them?"" I asked. She quietly said something along the lines of ""Yes because my laundry is all different."" 

I told her it was fine, I could do my laundry later, but that I would be back down in one hour to put my laundry in. 

I went back upstairs, cleaned my apartment for an hour and fifteen minutes, and then took my laundry back down. The one that had been in use before was running again (Someone must have come to switch their laundry) and all three of her washers were just sitting there with her laundry in them. So, as was the norm at my old building, I took her laundry out of the washer and set it on top so I could put my clothes in. 

While I was in the middle of doing this, she came down and freaked out at me for taking her laundry out. I very calmly told her that it had been far longer than an hour at this point, that these were shared facilities, and it's pretty inconsiderate to take up three of the four available washers in the first place. 

She freaked out, moved her laundry, and then stormed out saying she was going to call apartment management about me. I do feel kind of bad because I didn't want her laundry to get gross, but it's Sunday and we all have clothes to wash. AITA?",False,False

He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his ""anti vaxxer sister"" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me.

I am a 23M with a long-term GF (23F). We have plans of getting a house in a different part of the country (where are better job offers) and getting married. However, my parents (70 and 71) really want me to stay with them. We have a big house where can two families live without any issues and they are pouring a lot of money and time into renovating it so I can stay living with them. They invested tens of thousands of dollars into renovating it, so they would make it livable for two families even though I have been saying for many years that I want to move out.

Every time I say it, they either ignore it or they say how dumb it would be to buy a house even though I already have one or they say how ungrateful son I am for not wanting to take care of them after everything they did for me (they paid for my university, bought me a car etc..). Sometimes they even say it's my GF's idea and that I would happily live with them if it wasn't for her.

Honestly, I love my parents and they did a lot for me, but I can't imagine living with them. We are just too different and we constantly argue about something. Sometimes it's really bad for my mental health, arguing so much. On the other hand, I know that they are old and they do need help.

1,"AITA for helping one female coworker carry something heavy but ignoring the other? | Hello! Disclaimer, this is a throwaway account.

I (25M) work as a server at a restaurant. I get along with the whole staff really well, and I have two female coworkers we'll call Emily and Jen. Emily is 22 and Jen is in her 30s.

The restaurant has 3 floors, so when you work on the second or third floor, part of the sidework entails carrying a big bin full of dirty dishes down the stairs and unloading it in the kitchen. It usually has to be taken down 5-6 times a shift, and we try to rotate who does this, but there is plenty of other work to do so it usually all works out.

Tonight I was on the third floor with Emily and Jen. Emily is pretty thin, and I've noticed sometimes she struggles to carry really heavy things. She doesn't complain or ask for help but her arms will shake sometimes and she is clearly having a hard time. Tonight she went to go take down the bus bin when it was really full, and I just took it from her and said something like ""I've got it, it's really heavy"" and took it down. I'm not trying to be a white knight or anything but it's just way quicker and easier if I do it and get it over with.

Later in the night, Jen and I were cleaning up and she randomly made a comment to me like ""You better make sure Emily actually does some work tonight, since you were doing everything for her earlier."" I was taken aback and said something like ""I just took down the bin for her since it was heavy. We're still getting everything done."" She then got really snide and was like ""well are you just helping cause it's heavy, or because she's cute? You never carry shit down for me."" I didn't even know how to respond to this.

Jen is a lot bigger than Emily and I've never seen her struggle to carry stuff. Obviously I'm not going to say this. I guess I could see how Jen got offended because it could come off like I'm playing favorites and helping certain coworkers over others?

AITA for somehow discriminating against Jen? Should I have just let Emily carry the thing??

His mom is visiting from out of state next month and asked if she could stay with us a couple nights to “help out”. She wants to sleep on our couch with me (it fits two people sleeping comfortably). When our twins were first born she did this and I was miserable because she snores SO LOUD. Not only was I waking up every 1-2 hours to feed our twins, but I’d lay there wide awake when they’d finally go back to sleep because of her snoring. It was awful! I told my husband I don’t want her to stay with us because of the snoring and I suggested that she stays at her brother’s or sister’s house (both live in the same city as us), or a 2nd option, get a hotel.

1,"AITA for asking my mom to stop buying gifts for my girlfriend? | My girlfriend and her mom have a weird relationship. Her mom isn’t very supportive of her and makes her feel worse when she’s already down. For example, my girlfriend has a chronic illness and it flared up during our anniversary weekend, when we were staying at my parents’ before we went into the city to celebrate. When my girlfriend texted her mom, her mom said “Great, now you’re a burden on his parents”, even though my parents weren’t taking care of her and didn’t mind, in fact they were worried. Overall, just not the best mother.

One other thing she does, is not ever really buy my girlfriend gifts or celebrate her accomplishments. My girlfriend doesn’t feel entitled to them, but even just a card acknowledging her birthday sometimes would be appreciated. My girlfriend does theatre and her mom never gets her flowers or cards or anything to celebrate that, if she even shows up to the performances at all. It makes my girlfriend sad, because she feels like her mom doesn’t give a shit. She’s tried talking to her about it, but her mom makes excuses.

The thing is, my mom is very supportive, which is sweet. She’ll show up to every show my girlfriend is in, which is great. But she ends up going over the top, buying her flowers and gifts. My girlfriend is appreciative, but then gets upset saying “Your mom is so much nicer to me than my own mom, why can’t she be like that?”

It all sort of came to a head recently. I knew that my girlfriend’s mom was coming to my girlfriend’s summer performance and that she was giving her a coupon for clothes shopping, which I knew that would make my girlfriend upset. So, I asked my mom to not make a big deal of it and to not get my girlfriend flowers or anything fancy. It was just going to upstage her mom, then upset her and make her go into a tailspin about how her mom sucks, and how my mom loves her more. My mom showed up to the performance with a bouquet of flowers, a pair of earrings and a card. Low and behold, after the performance, I had to hear the same thing. My mom loves her more. Why is her mom so uncaring, why can’t she give her gifts and a card? The same thing, same cycle.

We're currently college seniors and we started dating only 4 months ago. For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. 

Anyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. 

So when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason.

1,"AITA for not attending family therapy? | My ex wife is extremely dramatic, overbearing and manipulative. She loves to have her way. She has primary custody of our 7 year old who she is convinced needs a therapist because he has been acting out in school. So she enrolled him with one who also does family therapy. 

That therapist has since diagnosed him with anxiety. 

I keep getting invites from my ex to go to their family therapy sessions. He does his own individually once a week. Family is once a month. I am refusing to go. One because the times are always super inconvenient.
They meet at his school (this is a school based therapy so he doesn’t miss school). Two because my wife is convinced that my lack of a good relationship with him is part of the issue. 

Together they have apparently and my son has separately told the therapist that I say mean things to him (I just don’t baby him) and that I never see him (not true). I admit I could spend more time with him but being able to always be there is hard. I make it when I can and I communicate with him when I can’t. 

A year ago she was feeling overwhelmed  after a “medical thing” (she claimed she almost died from cancer but it was really a simple surgery) and cried to me about taking him for a while. I couldn’t. She threatened to drop him off at my parents and run away.  She has since claimed to have worked through it with her own therapist and talked through it with our son apologizing for “mommy having a tough time”. 

I asked the therapist on the phone if my son talked about me and she said “Yes, sometimes” Then she asked me to come in for the next session but I was working that day. 


I think a huge issue is her having tried to abandon him and generally just being who she is which is an awful person and my son picks up on that. 

I have told her flat out I am not going to those appointments. I have ignored the emails from the therapist. 

I am walking into a room already primed to consider me at fault and I don’t think I need to be there for that. Why? So she can say “see who agrees with me” and be smug about it. 

She said she talked to a lawyer and she could take it to court to get it ordered and I told her to go ahead but I will fight to choose the therapist, not someone already on her side. I am sure she has bought all my exes lies and my son’s exaggerations that are fed and created by my ex.

0,"AITA for not paying for our full share of the bill on a double date? | Recently my guy and I went on a double date with two of my close friends. When the bill came my boyfriend realized that he didn’t have his wallet. No problem at all. Of course I’d cover his portion. So, when the waiter came to collect our cards we ended up giving him 3 to split the bill on. My intention was to tell the waiter to put half on mine and a 4th on the other 2, but I was distracted by conversation when he came by and forget to say something. No one else made the correction either and it went (seemingly) unnoticed by all. 

 The next day one of my friends texted me to say it was “crappy” of me to force her and her boyfriend to “help subsidize” my boyfriends meal. I had no idea what she meant until she pointed out the mistake I’d made. I apologized and asked if she’d like me to Venmo her the difference. Her response was this: 

“Yeah. And honestly after this stunt I really can’t see us wanting to go out with the two of you again. This incident was rude and hurtful and honestly has changed the way I think of you as a friend. Unbelievable.” 

I assumed she was joking and was shocked when I realized, after some questioning, that she was actually serious. We haven’t spoken since and I’m still very bewildered.

Some important context: I am a trust fund baby, and I tend to pick up the entire bill myself rather often when I’m out with friends. Not always, but most of the time, I do treat my friends. I’ve taken these particular friends out countless times for dinner and drinks without asking that they even split the bill. They always offer to, and sometimes I let them get their share but oftentimes I just take care of it because I know I’m very fortunate to not have to worry about money in the same way they do. 

Given that context, I just feel like her reaction is uncalled for. Sure, I made a mistake, and I can see how it’s uncool to stick them with part of the bill for my guys meal but over our years of friendship I have undoubtedly paid for hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of dinner and drinks and never made a peep about it. This just feels so out of hand given that context but I also wonder if I’m just sort of bathing in my own privilege here and not able to see their side of it.

1,"AITA For bringing whiskey to a party? | Throwaway, since college me and a large group of friends have always been big drinkers (at our heaviest, we were drinking ~30-40 units per week, mostly on weekends). A few years after college, one of our friends ended up getting an enlarged liver which, while it wasn't severe and the rest of us were still healthy, scared us into wanting to sober up more and take a break.

So we made a pact to try to stay clean. It was nothing formal, i.e stop drinking completely. Just to slow down/stop at our own pace. Time went by and the pact was largely successful, most stopped completely, a couple drastically reduced their drinking. 

So cut towards last weekend, one of my friends (one who slowed down his drinking and only drinks on special occasions) was having a birthday party. Many of my friends who were involved in the pact were there with a couple of others who weren't. I figured it's been awhile so us having a drink to celebrate couldn't hurt.

When I unveiled the whiskey at the party, the host seemed uncomfortable but since some of the at the party were drinkers, he allowed it, I set it aside and didn't think too much about it. Later on, a couple of other friends who stayed sober came up to me and said ""why would you bring whiskey for a get together with us?""

I reiterated that there were a couple of people at the party who were never involved in the pact. One of my other friends said ""the whiskey is hard to look at...""

And throughout the night, I was bitched at by people in the pact to get rid of the whiskey.

1,"AITA for asking my boyfriend to pick up and drop off my child on weekends which made him suggest a break up? | So for full disclosure my partner works full time and is usually at work from 7am-7pm, and I have a weekend job that requires me to be away from 9am-12pm. We don’t live together but we are local so we are always in and out of each other’s homes. 

My son decided he wanted to play football on weekends- he’s 12 years old and really excited about it. I was initially going to ask my bf if he could pay for it but I mentioned it to my mum when I went around for a cup of tea and she was strongly expecting me to pay and told me it was my responsibility not my bf’s... even though he’s been in my life 3 years. 

So I ended up having to pay but in order to afford it I extended my hours at work to 9-5. I asked my bf if he’d be willing to pick up and drop off my son on weekends as obviously if be at work and he looked uncomfortable and said sorry no can’t his dad drop him? 

I admit I snapped at him and told him that his dad lives in south London whereas we live in north London and his dad doesn’t drive but my boyfriend does. I asked him if he really wanted to be part of this family and if he did he wouldn’t mind doing small stuff like this for me. I suppose his dad COULD take him but what would be a 1 hour + journey for his dad would take 15 minutes for my bf. 

He got really angry and told me that he was having to work longer hours to support me and my son and that he wanted to use his weekends to go to football games etc as I wasn’t at home anyway. He said that he wanted to chill and relax and that I was forcing things on him way too quick. He then suggested that we break up bc ”I was putting too many responsibilities on him” and I was like.. really? Over a bloody football game? Welcome to the real world love! 

The little sneak then went over to see my mum and had a heart to heart with her which ended up in HER calling ME and her telling me I am out of line.

When she says no I always like to know a reason why, I don't like when people close to me just say no without giving a reason for stuff. For example I wanted her to try a coffee I made today and she so no thanks. I just wanted to know why not since I was proud of how it came out(different method than usual and I am not good at making things usually) and really wanted her to try it.

0,"AITA for not cooking for my daughter anymore because I feel she doesn't appreciate it? | I really need to know if I'm in the wrong here so the advice is appreciated. 

&#x200B;

I've always been the resident chef for my family. My wife is an awful cook (her words, not mine) so over the years I've been the one to cook every meal for my family. I've spent a lot of time learning too. I've taken multiple classes each year to help me and honestly it's slowly became a passion of mine. So, for most of the night for the past 16 years i've come home and spent at least an hour, often several making diner for my family. 

This is where my daughter comes in, lets call her sally. Sally turned 16 this year and oh boy has it been rough. She never left her rebellious phase. She has always tried to make me and her mom know how much she hates us and that she can't wait till she's in the ""real world"" so she can finally be free. I get it. She's at that age where she wants more freedom and sometimes we can be hard on her. That's not the problem here. 

One of sally's new things though is telling me how much my cooking sucks. For the past two weeks every night i've cooked she will tell me everything wrong with the meal i've cooked. She will go on all night about the ""crap"" I forced her to eat and that she should just be able to cook her own meal instead. She's far past the age of letting her go hungry so I just have let it go, until last night. I got off work late so I just decided to grab burgers on the way home for diner. Sally went on and on after about how she ""finally had decent food to eat"" and that ""this stuff wasn't cooked by a pathetic wannabe chef"". I don't know why but that hit me hard and I ended up crying in my room after. My wife caught me and told me it needs to stop now. 

So tonight when I got home I cooked enough for me, my wife, and my son. I steamed some rice and beans and put them on a plate for my daughter. When she came to eat I informed her since I only cook ""crap"" i made her something else and that was all she would be eating in this house from now on. She blew up. She called me an ass and a bad father before storming to her room. My son things I'm just being mean and that i've sunk to her level while my wife says I did the right thing. I talked to my mom too and she says this was a heavy over reaction and that all teens do this at some point and that I only will make things worse.

EVERYTHING that she talks about is about her age. If we're talking about favourite consoles she'll chirp in with ""you're all so young, I had an <insert here> console"". If we're talking about favourite movies then it's about how we weren't born when she went to see a film at the cinema. If we're talking about music then it's about how all the bands she listens to were before we were born. Everything is about her age or her complaining about her age.

It all came to a head when we were talking about mortgages as some of us are buying houses, she chimed in with how it's cute we're all buying out first house and how she's bought a lot of them. However she then chimed in with ""I don't know why I hang out with you all, you're all so young"" so I said ""Why do you hang out with us? All you do is talk about age, we get it...you're old"".

I was getting a medium latte from a well known chain yesterday which was served after payment in a 'latte cup' (tall glass tumbler with a metal holder and a stubby handle that doesn't connect to the rest of the cup). 
I asked the staff member if I could tip it into a ceramic one (gesturing at the same size one I was after) - explaining my disability makes it hard to hold and I'd be prone to spilling it everywhere or burning myself. 

She looked a bit confused, and poured it into a similar ceramic cup that was half the size...and then proceeded to pour the rest of my coffee down the sink.
 I said I'd paid for a nedium but she shrugged and said she'd changed the cup as I'd asked but wouldn't refund the difference in size.

I felt embarrassed at the time because lots of people were watching, sodrank up and left. I don't think this was a language barrier issue but I'm torn about complaining.

0,"WIBTAH If I Skipped My Brother's Wedding | I will make this quick and save most of you the trouble of reading a lot.  I am a Lt in the military and I work as a pilot.

A few months ago both my wife of three years and our child died while she was giving birth.  Everyone tells me how sorry they are, how amazing of a woman she was, how much of a great father I would’ve have been.   I don’t like hearing it, I don’t want to know what I could have been, should have been, or would have been because it doesn’t exist anymore.  

My brother is getting married later this summer and everyone is preparing for that.  I’m really happy for them and both families.  Plus it slowly took everyone’s focus off me and they can focus on the happier future.  I was obviously going to be a groomsmen for him, was going to give a speech after the best man, and just tease him in front of his new wife and family.  My wife was looking forward to it and so was everyone else.  People say they like my speeches and toasts, and my wife used to joke that every time I talk the room gets quiet so everyone can hear what I say.  

I just don’t think I’m mentally prepared to go to my brother’s wedding.  I don’t think I’ll be ready in a few months either.  I already texted him it’s hard for me to meet up with the groomsmen once a month when they go out to dinner and plan stuff out.  Thankfully he understands due to my job but the reality is I just don’t want to be around it.  It’s not out of hate or angry or sorrow, I just really want to be alone and focus on work.  It’s the only thing that keeps me going.  That rush I feel when I take off at full speed and push the throttle harder once I’m soaring.  Twisting the stick and pushing my body to feel that high.  It’s the drive and push keeping me going and takes my mind off my miserable life.  

I’ve been thinking of asking my commander for a TDY or if I could deploy with another squadron during the summer.  Just hoping I can give a valid excuse why I can’t go to the wedding.  I promise I’ll pay my brother his wedding respects before and after the wedding, I’ll even go over to his place once he’s married and spoil them with gifts.

I know it’s a horrible thing to not want to go to my little brother’s wedding but I honestly can’t do it.  Every day I wish something would just happen to me during a flight exercise or while I’m driving to work or even some accident at work.  My brother deserves a better brother who won’t abandon his wedding and I’m sorry I can’t be that stronger older brother.

1,"AITA for getting frustrated at how loudly and confrontationally my girlfriend works from her home office? | My girlfriend moved into my house about a year ago and for a long time things went smoothly. But this month, when she's had to transition to working from home, it's been frustrating.

She works in robotics, and when she took her whole work setup home, she set up in the dining room.

My work from home setup is in the computer room / home library, which is off the same hallway as the dining room. Neither room has doors, so I hear everything.

And she's so noisy. She has a lot of conference calls and meetings, and they get heated. Like her and several coworkers having what sounds like a really intense argument over technical stuff.

I'll ask her what that was about, and she'll be like ""it's all good, just a meeting with Joe and Tim."" And I'll be surprised because she's always talked about Joe and Tim as good friends.

Just last Friday, I heard just her end of the conversation, but she was really tearing into someone saying that something wasn't going to work, and she wasn't about to waste her time trying to cobble something together based on a poor design. She  sounded super dismissive.

I asked later what that was about, and she said ""Just my weekly meeting with my boss, were figuring out how to implement the (thing)"" 

I said that I would never talk to a boss like that, and I was kind of worried about the state of her job if she kept on like that. 

She said that it's all good, her boss hired her because of her practical experience in a certain thing that a lot of people only know academically, and he'd rather have an honest reality check when something's not gonna work.

I kinda find that hard to wrap my head around, even if that's the case that was such a confrontational way to put it.

And day-in day-out it's like this. A couple hours of silence as she works, then an explosion of noise from a conference call. And repeat. It's honestly stressful to hear raised voices, seeming anger over technical stuff that I don't really have the context for so I just get the tone of voice, etc.

I've talked to her about this, and she said that's just how people talk when they get really passionate about something they're doing. They're not really angry, just opinionated. And she's legit on good terms with her coworkers, she just got a great raise at her last performance review, there are no problems.

I told her that still, I don't like it, I don't like living in a house with someone who has these kinds of arguments day in and day out that I have to hear. And that I regretted moving in together, I hadn't known this side of her when I moved her in.

She got really upset about that and said that it's always been there. And there's nothing bad about actually giving a damn about your work.

0,"AITA for quietly wishing my mom would pass away sooner rather than later? | Let me preface by saying: I love my mom. Very much. This is not out of hate, but more coming from a place of I guess... selfishness.
(Throw away for obvious reasons)

My mom has dementia. She is completely losing it. Can't complete simple tasks, starting to shit herself, is almost a 10-second-Tom. She has no idea how old I am (25F, youngest of 4) or where I live, etc. 

In addition to the dementia she has severe scoliosis that has been endangering her organs for the past few years, emphysema while she continues to smoke who knows how many cigarettes a day (often having two lit at once b/c she forgets she's smoking one), and some other health issues.

She lives with my dad about an hour away. My dad still works full time, two days a week from home. She is driving him nuts and he is so stressed out. She constantly accuses him of stealing her stuff (like candles or her slippers) - something that is common with people with dementia. She refuses to sleep or eat a lot of the time, magnifying her symptoms. She forgets when family visit or when my dad takes her out (probably 6 days a week) and then gets mad no one takes her anywhere. I'm aware it is all part of the dementia, but it makes things so hard.

I want to move out of state and I won't do it while she is still alive. I'm also worried I'm going to lose my dad before my mom because he is under so much stress. He has high blood pressure and diabetes. The pain I, snd the rest of my family, have from seeing my mom like this is almost unbearable. It's not the woman I remember raising me, and in fact I'm starting to forget how she once was. 

I've been thinking it would be better if she just passed away sooner rather than later. God I feel horrible even typing this... but I don't want to see her suffer like this anymore and I don't want to see my dad suffer from it either. They both break down crying (seperately) because it is so hard.

This is pretty common and the two friends would've almost certainly seen me do this before. He agreed so I pushed my plate over to him. 

One of the friends said ""well, *I'd* like some too"" in a pissed off tone and started helping herself to my leftovers. The other friend said ""yeah, me too"" and took a piece of food from my plate as well. My boyfriend didn't say anything so neither did I, but the tone struck me as somewhat rude.

0,"AITA for being upset that my parents are helping my sister through school? | My(21F) sister (19F) has always been the favorite with my parents. When the car we shared broke down they bought her a newer/used one and I got the hand-me-down minivan, when we went to college they wouldn’t help me with a $12,000 loan so I had to drop out of a school I had chosen freshman year and go to community college. On the flip side they helped and have paid about $2000 for my sisters $11000 loan so she could go to a nicer school cause she “didn’t want to go to the same school as me”, I’m not kidding.

My sister dropped out of school halfway through her freshman year and now wants to start again, at the same community college I went to.

I get it schools hard, I dropped out too my sophomore year cause I couldn’t afford it. I’ve been saving since to start school again because I’ve always tried to pay my own way because my parents rarely offer to help me. I lost all my savings due to being unemployed for a few months and now my intended start date has been pushed back at least 6 months if not a year. When I was in school there was another point that I lost my job and had to ask my parents to help me pay my tuition and told them I would pay them back immediately. They agreed and paid about $800 for me, which I then paid $300 back and they told me the rest was a gift so I did not have to pay it back to them. That was the extent of the help I received in community college, not once since then have they offered to help me pay for school in anyway.

My sister on the other hand can afford to pay for herself and has been able to for a while, but she wastes her money on ordering clothes and getting $70-80 acrylic nails every other week. 

At the community college where I went, and where my sister wants to start, it’s only about $1200 a quarter. She doesn’t have anything saved, she still has a $9000 loan to pay off, but she should be perfectly fine to pay for school entirely if she budgets correctly. 

I was talking to my mother about my sister starting school today and I said she should start a payment plan to which my mom replied “oh no, we’re going to help her”. I got upset and said “You shouldn’t offer to help her, she can afford it herself, especially if she cuts out the unnecessary stuff, you never offered to help me unless I was desperate and asked.”  My mom just walked away like I had slapped her in the face, and now she’s giving me the cold shoulder too.

1,"AITA for being confident about my talents? | So I play music. A lot of it. I mostly play guitar bass, and I practice my ass off. I've always had a good sense of pitch, so it felt natural to start playing about a year ago. I practice for hours on end, and by this time, I'd like to say I'm one of the better players in my city. I've gotten a decent amount of gigs, a few people know my name, and I work constantly, reading up on techniques and shit.

So then, while talking music with my sister I just said ""I'm probably the best bassist in this city"". Humble? Definitely not, but given that bass isn't a super popular instrument, (most guys just stick to the simple background role) I think it is fair to say that I am. 

My sister called me an asshole and said the music school kids play way better. I countered by saying I know a lot of those kids, I play equally as difficult stuff, I've even been in bands with them, and have a gauge of their skill, and I study and experiment as much, just not with a teacher. 

My sister said I'm way too arrogant and that they still play better. I get frustrated, because again, I know these people, and they are good, many of them are equal, but none of them are really better. I'm not trying to be an asshole here, trust me. I'm just confident in my skills.

1,"AITA for taking away my niece's flower girl duty the day of the wedding? | Got married last weekend and had a lovely day, but had some commotion early on the wedding day. 

For flower girl, we had a choice between my two nieces, Amber and Katie. They're both eight and it was a tough decision. Unfortunately for my perfect day I felt shallow and since Amber has more of a typical angelic ''cute'' appearance (very long hair, glasses, big smile) I picked her. Her parents also convinced me she deserved it because she got top marks in some assessment her school did. 

During the wedding prep Katie and her dad (my brother) kept telling me that Amber had been bullying her about the fact she didn't get the job. The girls have never liked each other for reasons I don't know. I didn't pay too much mind to it since I was too caught up in myself.

On the wedding morning I got to witness the bullying myself and it was pretty cruel. Amber (and keep in mind this is an eight year old child) told Katie that she'd never get married because she's too ugly. I could imagine how upsetting this would be for a child and I made Amber apologise and also took away the flower girl job and gave it to Katie. Amber was crying throughout the wedding day, and for the past days I haven't heard anything from her dad my other brother. 

My husband and I are going away on our honeymoon on thursday, and i was anxious to get in touch with my brother before we leave.

My husband's car is 15 years old and has 265k miles on it. (He's said repeatedly that he wants to hit 300k.) The check engine and brake lights have been on for several months. A few weeks ago, the car overheated and died while I was driving it, and he discovered a crack in the radiator that he sealed with some kind of epoxy. (He previously said that it probably just needed fluid.) Then the brakes started grinding, and after a few days he agreed to take it into the shop. In the interim, the brakes failed to catch correctly while I was driving our daughter home from daycare, and I narrowly avoided an accident. He had the brakes replaced (although previously he'd said, as with the radiator, that they only needed fluid).

Now the check engine light is flashing, and the car is shaking at speeds above 50mph. Every Google search result says this indicates a misfire that could result in catastrophic engine damage (something about the catalytic converter). My husband says he's narrowed it down to a fuel injector problem, and he wants to repair it himself today and go on the road trip tomorrow as planned. I told him that I didn't trust the car and didn't want our daughter in it, and I texted our friends last night and said we couldn't go.

Now my husband is angry--he thinks I'm being anxious for no reason because he knows cars better than I do and has done ""hundreds of hours of research"" into car repair. (He is not a mechanic, but he is very handy, and he's made successful car repairs in the past.) Our friends are disappointed because they planned a weekend of activities that they won't be able to reschedule for several months. No one seems to agree with me that driving would have been unsafe.

1,"AITA for suggesting to my colleague that she could spend less money on her lunch? | My colleague (early 40s) is a single mother to a 5 year old. She's mentioned several times that money is tight.
Her regular lunch is a soda and a store bought sandwich, which are both quite expensive in our country. Tap water and home made food would probably be one tenth of the price.
We work together every other Saturday, but lately there's only been need for one of us to work. Each time she has asked if it's OK that she's the one to work, cause she needs the money. That's fine with me, but I do get annoyed when I hear her complaining about how she can't afford to take a single day off when I see how she spends her money. I don't know anything other than the lunch, but just there she could probably save enough to take one day off monthly. I mostly feel bad for her daughter.

I told her that if she wants to try to save some money, she could make her own sandwiches at home that are just as good and a lot cheaper, and told her what I usually buy to make mine. I also said that I save a lot by just drinking tap water. She didn't call me an asshole, but she did seem quite offended and just said that she knows very well what she can and can't afford to spend her own money on.

1,"AITA for taking the fall for the girl I love, and then getting on cold feet and reporting the violations. | This girl in my class I like a lot.  She is super attractive and I liked her a lot.   As a nerd I never get attention from girls so I was stupid and thought I was in love and somehow we were going to be together.  We were lab partners the entire year and I did he lab reports and assignments all for her.  I'm pretty studious so she got A's on her assignments.  On the final she asked if she could sit next to me and make it easy to copy.  I resisted at first but she said she had something special for me after the test and I agreed.

Well she copied and after she said she was just kidding about something special and that her use of me was done.  I emailed the professor about the cheating on the final exam, but not about the labs or anything.  I told him the truth that I let her cheat.  He failed both of us on the exam, which was worth 20 percent of our grade so she got a D in the class instead of a B and I got a C instead of an A.  She sent me a profanity littered text insulting me and saying she needed a C in this class cause it was a core major class and her parents we're going to kill her and that this cheating was going to be on her academic record forever.  I blocked her number and deleted her snap and that was it.

0,"AITA for holding a heavy dog on the ground to prevent it from jumping on me? | My girlfriend wanted me to visit her dad with her. He has four dogs, one of which is a young boxer, but already roughly 45lbs. I have already pointed out to her that i don't like going there because this dog is not disciplined and jumps all over me (it's already ruined some of her clothes because it ripped holes in her shirts and leggings with its claws). 

When we get there the dog is jumping wildly out of control over usual and runs to me immediately when i sit down. I try to push it away but it keeps jumping full force on me. I ask multiple times for someone to get it, put it outside or something. No one does anything, they just laugh and say,  ""it's just a puppy!"" It's like 7 months old at this point and heavy. This goes on for a solid 30 minutes or longer. So I finally assertively hold it down on the ground until it calms down. I didn't hurt it, but I was assertive to show it i'm in charge. It stopped jumping on me uncontrollably after that, but everyone acted like I was a horrible person. Her dad stared at me like i was an asshole and later when we left she told me i had no right to do that and it's just a puppy.

0,"AITA For Still Being Upset At My Mum? | I was going through my first major surgery on the carpal(?) bones in my left wrist. The doctor needed to remove literal dying/dead bones from my wrist and create a new joint from what was remaining. Because I lived in a small country town I was flown to the Capital city of my State a day before the surgery. Needless to say I was terrified, what if it didn't work? What if it just made things worse? This wasn't a cure for my medical issue, it was simply a treatment to stop the incredible pain I was suffering.

Thankfully my sister was willing to fly down with me and keep my from panicking. Great right? Well yes, however because it was my first 'Big Surgery' my Mum insisted on coming with me even though I told her I'd rather my sister came. Alright whatever I can deal with that, Mum is also good at keeping me calm and preventing my panic attacks too. 

So we flew down and it was finally the big day. After sitting in the waiting room for hours a nurse came, Mum promised me she'd be right by my side when I woke up so I let the nurse take me to the pre-op area where they stuck countless needles into me. Now I feel like I need to mention that needles are my biggest fear so this was a nightmare, still I told the nurses to ignore my carrying on and do what they needed to do. 

Alright, everything is going great, I get wheeled into the operating room and speak with my doctor for a few minutes before they put me to sleep. Everything was going great until I woke up. 

I woke up alone in a darkroom, no lights and no noises, that's what I was greeted with. I tried to move but I was still under the effects of the anesthetic, I tired to speak but not a sound came out. I couldn't even feel my left arm anymore. The nurses were alerted to my panic when my heart monitor spiked and rushed in. They calmed me down, explained everything like the simply fact that I wouldn't be able to move my arm for a least a week due to local anesthetic they injected into my neck in the pre-op and I was feeling decent, still drowsy and incredibly sick but better. 

Maybe half an hour later I get a call which I answer without looking at the caller ID. I cried out Mum hoping it would be her but it wasn't, instead it was my out of breath brother who had called. He called me to explain that Mum had missed her train and wasn't going to make it for at least another hour and he was rushing to get to my side.

Here's the thing, we were staying at my Brother's apartment which was less than a 10 minute walk from the hospital, the reason Mum missed her train while I was going through my big ordeal was because she was getting marijuana from someone who lived far away. 

Fucking drugs were more important then me.

Today he shared a recipe for a cookie I had never heard of that just seemed to be an oatmeal cookie. I googled the cookie name and the first thing that came up was an identical recipe to his mom's handwritten one, and it's a recipe that came on the tin of oats all through the 60s-90s. Out of curiosity, I googled a few others and a few of her other recipes are also just recipes from the package.

I thought he would think it was interesting, so I replied with a link to the oatmeal cookies and the other recipes I researched and said, I think we know your mom's secret! I didn't mean it to be rude or that she's a bad cook, my mother doesn't cook at all and neither do I. I just thought it was interesting that recipes from the tin became his family's 'family recipes' somehow.

0,"AITA for not giving my college roommate free rides back home because of a lease ""benefit"" I received? | At the beginning of the year, we both signed a lease to get a nice apartment right off-campus.  When we went in to sign the lease, they had a deal going on in which we were able to choose between 50% off a parking spot or a free Nintendo Switch. Since my roommate and I do not have time for video games, he told me he was cool with me getting the 50% off parking since I am the only one that owns a car. I have a car on campus as it is helpful for getting groceries and I like to go back home at least once a month. 

I usually give him rides back home as our hometowns are very near each other and we typically split the gas. I usually charge him around $30 for a round trip back home that is three hours away. I never charge him for gas when we go grocery shopping or cruise around town.  Out of nowhere, he has been subtly bringing up the fact that he deserves at least 3-4 free rides back home because he received ""no benefit"" out of signing the lease. Right off the bat, I said no because I still had to pay for the parking spot and there are much more expenses that go into my car other than just the gas. I truly believe he is getting a benefit out of this as he is paying much less for a round trip to home compared to taking the bus or the train. He keeps bringing up the fact that he got ""no benefit"" out of the deal at least once a week since we started school this semester and he has been making me feel as if I am in the wrong for this. He has now even said that I owe *him* half of what I paid for the parking spot. My philosophy is that if he truly had an issue with this he should have brought it up at the time we signed the apartment lease.

1,"AITA for going on the bachelorette without the bride? | I'm the groom's sister and the bride, Jessie, asked me to be her maid of honour, and there were 2 bridesmaids, Jessie's cousins. We were all excited for the bachelorette and then Jessie said she didn't want one because she couldn't be arsed to plan it. I offered to plan everything, and I planned the perfect weekend at a spa hotel. If Jessie had any complaints she didn't tell me about them. The hotel was a few hours away so we agreed to meet there, and me and one of the cousins sorted out childcare so we could go as we both have kids.

On the Thursday night before we're meant to go Jessie calls me from A&E (emergency room). My idiot brother was on his bachelor party (a 3 day adventure trip), and fell from high enough to break a couple bones. Jessie says she now can't go to the bachelorette and as the hotel has free cancellation until noon on Friday, can I cancel the hotel. I try telling her how excited everyone is and that we can't go without her but she won't hear it and just tells me to cancel and hangs up.

I know for a fact my brother would have been fine. He's an idiot and he's broken just about every bone in his body by now. He was with our older brother and I called my older brother who said the idiot was fine, he'd just gone rock climbing and fallen because his caribiner didn't close properly. It wasn't from very high. He said he'd broken an arm and a couple ribs, but the idiot would be fine and they were letting him go as soon as they had finished with the casts and were sure there was no concussion.

My view is that there's no point giving up a great weekend because the man who has yet to go a year without breaking any bones broke another, and he's had way worse, even just in the last year or so, plus we were all looking forward to it and we'd sorted out childcare and made arrangements already. I called him on Friday and he still wasn't discharged but I asked him to talk to Jessie for me and he said he would.

Anyway, Saturday morning, we all get to the hotel. Jessie isn't here and she isn't answering her phone. I call my brother and he says Jessie is with him in the hospital. I asked when she'd be coming. Jessie takes the phone and starts getting annoyed at me, saying ""what the hell? I thought you were cancelling? Your brother is in hospital"". I tell her he's fine and me and everyone else is here now. She tells us to have a nice weekend without her. I spend the weekend celebrating the upcoming marriage of 2 people who aren't here because it is no longer refundable and have to pay extra because the cost is now split 3 ways instead of 4.

We get home and I go to see my brother and Jessie. Jessie tells us that a couple of her friends are now going to help her out, and basically fires me and her cousins as MOH/bridesmaids. I turn to my brother, expecting him to side with me, and he says it's her call.

1,"AITA for getting my girlfriend's friend a nintendo switch for her birthday? | EDIT: this is my throwaway account because you can never be too careful \~

Just as the description says, but some context is needed. My girlfriend of \~11 months has been talking about animal crossing (the new one released) as it was her favorite game growing up. She thinks the game is super cute, however whenever we watch an animal crossing video (of the new one) she always mentions how she wants to play, but could never buy a switch because she still wants to focus hard on school. She stated many times (per video) that if she ever gets animal crossing that ""It is over for my GPA"" - note she is in her 3rd year for undergrad and plans on going to grad school.

Enter her best friend (let's call her Janet) she also likes animal crossing, although probably not as much as my girlfriend. I met her through my girlfriend (we have gone for pizza runs always with my girlfriend there) and she seems super nice, always purely platonic and nothing awkward between us ever.

I know Janet's birthday is coming up (because she mentioned it) and this is where I fuck up. We all (my girlfriend, Janet, and I) hear Janet's complaints about her (long distance) boyfriend who is not her favorite. I feel bad because I already know that her (semi-flaky) boyfriend never gets her presents because he doesn't believe in giving presents (note: all yall dudes out there at least get something for your girl's birthday), however he is more than willing to receive presents from her for HIS birthday.

Here's where I come up with the good idea that makes my girlfriend very angry. I know my girlfriend would like to play the new animal crossing, but not own it because she really wants to focus on her grades. I know that Janet would love ANY present for her birthday, so why not give her something she would use and enjoy. I also know that my gf and Janet are good enough friends that they would share, and my gf would play too, just not too frequently so that she can still focus on her studies.

So Janet's birthday comes around and I get her the switch. She is really happy (probably because she didn't expect presents on her birthday) but my girlfriend is furious. She storms out of the room crying that I would give JANET such an expensive gift but not her. I explained to her that it was really for both of you as she would play it too but she is not having it. I write this at 3AM on the couch in our living room.

Recently, a professional contact, who would gain a lot from earning her favor, wrote her an e-mail about a movie she worked on that was effusive to an insane degree. I don't want to quote the entire thing but one sentence popped out to me. This person said that her movie is ""better or as good as anything that is out there (past or present)""

Now, I am encouraging of my wife and we frequently collaborate, so I swear this is not coming from a place of jealousy or something but that sentence made me burst out laughing. Her movie is pretty good but for this person to say that it is one of the best movies ever made ""past or present"" in the history of cinema... It's pretty crazy, to say the least. I told my wife that this person is either being insincere and swinging for the fences to gain her approval or he hasn't seen many movies.

At first we laughed about it together but then I could tell she got a little sullen and hurt. I didn't want to hurt her feelings obviously and maybe I overstepped. Was I being an asshole about it? I already apologized and we're good but I wonder if I should do more to make up to her.

She eventually said it made her feel embarrassed and literally said that it's silly for a 23 year old man to be wearing a neon purple hat saying 'pierce the veil' on it (a band). She said that I should have already grown out of this phase, which I found very insulting as the hat is a way of expressing my identity. So I just said nothing, calmy looked her in the eye and said 'well your make up is over done'. She was quiet for a minute then told me I was being an immature asshole, and that it's normal for her to wear 'subtle make up' but not normal for me to wear my hat.

So this particular day its empty, so I rush in and shut the door and unpack my stuff. This study room is big enough for maybe 5 people. It’s a circle and it’s around 10 x 10 ft, maybe smaller. I start doing some work for class (this particular assignment I was drawing sketches) when another student that I didn’t know opened the door and sat down and said “you don’t mind, do you?” I was so shocked that someone would come in to such a small space with someone they don’t know that I just looked at them and didn’t say anything.

I’ve known A for about 6 years but we didn’t become actual friends until about 4 years ago. A and I had a good friendship and not much changed when I started dating my SO. We sometimes all hung out together but nothing unusual. 

Within the last year or so I’ve noticed a change in how A behaves when we’re with my SO. A tries really hard to come off as very intelligent and “cool” in front of my SO and often at my expense; If my SO and I disagree with each other on something, A will debate me every time to just be on my SO’s side even when they’re wrong. A will argue with me on anything (even topics in my own career field) just to make themselves seem smarter than me in front of my SO. A will contradict themselves or back track something they said just to be in agreement with my SO. A also very often goes out of the way to talk to my SO about things in front of me that A knows I can’t contribute to like their mutual friends or movies they’ve seen that I haven’t. (Background, A and my SO knew of each other as children but have years between them age wise so they’ve never been actual friends until me.) 

Recently a reliable source told me that A was telling them how A and my SO were ‘such good friends’ before I came around, and that I have no place to find it weird for them to hang out together alone. I’m not comfortable with that at this point. I am not by any means jealous or concerned, I trust my SO completely.

My 3 sisters have been sharing family memories as a way to move on and through this they started talking about going on a road trip as a family. They wanted to take a few weeks and go to about 6 different places we went to as a family when we were all kids. I wasn't against the idea at first and was willing to go and my mom is house bound so she never could have gone in the first place.

He thought of himself as a ""do it yourself"" kind of man but for the love of god was he not a mechanic. He fucked that car up to the point it had to get a whole new engine, twice.

Even during normal weather that thing always has a chance of just giving out, and it was the shittiest idea imaginable to take that thing out in the middle of winter.

Well, last Thursday the three of them set off for two weeks on the road trip. And by gods mercy that van lasted until last night. I got a call at 2 am last night from my sister's crying saying that the van broke down and they spent over 6 hours on a abandoned road trying to get help with no cell service. They got picked up at around 1 am and driven to a shitty motel where they got a room with 1 bed. All 3 of them started crying and asking me to come pick them up. Honestly, I was the only one who could probably ""save"" them. They are all single and all of our extended family live much farther away. And it was ""only"" an 11 hour drive.

I told them no.

I warned them over and over again this would happen and now this is there problem to deal with. I told them I would wire them money in the morning for bus tickets but I was not coming and getting them. This was the wrong answer as an hour later my mom called me half crying and half screaming saying I am abandoning them after they ""almost died"" and that I am the worst son/brother/person and that i'm an asshole. She also wired them money to get home. 

Well, now all three are trash talking me. So, aita?",False,False

He knows this but he said I was ""really fucked up"" and got angry with me and kept getting short with me about the topic.

0,"AITA for buying lunch for myself and my daughter out of my family’s joint bank account? | My husband and I share a joint checking account, and we each have individual accounts as well.  Our “rule” is that if we do things like a meal together, it’s out of the joint account, and if it’s something on our own we use our individual accounts. 

This week we’re vacationing with his family, and his parents gave us a relatively large sum of money “for expenses on the trip.”  This went into our joint account and we’ve used it to pay for things like amusement park tickets and the extra costs of being away from home. 

Today we’re all visiting an art museum together, he and his family decide they’re tired and they’ve seen enough boring old paintings, and leave me and my daughter (not his own—we’re a blended family) at the museum while they go do their own thing for the afternoon. While they’re gone, he and his family go to lunch, and his parents pay for that lunch. 

My daughter and I stay at the museum, eat lunch in the cafeteria there, and I pay for it out of the joint account. I figure that’s fair, because we were given the money specifically to pay for expenses on the trip. To me, it seems like his parents paid for his meal in person, and my meal by giving us the money to buy it ourselves. Same either way, right?

But now I’m being told that I’m greedy and selfish because I used *our* money to pay for *my* needs. 

Yes, I violated our rule but this circumstance seems obviously different to me. Is there a side I’m not seeing? Am I a greedy, selfish asshole? ",False,False
0,"AITA for getting my partners son a gift? | My partner has a son from a previous relationship. He's 7 and lives abroad. Due to various circumstances, my partner usually flies over there for visits and in the 2.5 years we have been together, I have never met him.


This year though, he came over with his mother for a few days. We live in a pretty rural area and their time was limited so we all decide to stay at his parents which is in a major city.


A few weeks prior to this, I was cleaning out my room at my parents and found two folders filled with Pokémon cards. I probably started this collection in 1999 and knowing that my partner's son likes Pokémon, asks him if its ok to give them to him when he's here. He loves the idea.

Yesterday, after we had a lovely day together, we gave him the folders and although it was from both of us, it was mentioned that it was my collection and I became super cool to a 7 year old. He's obsessed and literally tries to take the folder into the bath with him. His mum also loves the present. She has asked us in the past not to buy him expensive presents as it isn't how she's raising him and we've respected that.

Later on, his auntie comes by with a huge present for him - a very expensive radio controlled car. It's great but it's not holding a candle to the Pokémon cards. Partly as they didn't buy batteries so he couldn't even play with it. Her partner seemed pretty miffed at the time and snapped at me as when I tidied away his toys at bedtime, I also tidied the car away.

My SIL & MIL have been texting me non stop tonight saying it wasn't my place to get him a gift and that I've basically bought his affection. They're accusing me of emotionally manipulating a 7 year old when I literally just had something cool that I thought he might appreciate - I don't care who he thinks got him it as long as he likes it. 

TLDR - gave my partner's son my Pokémon collection. SIL & MIL think I'm trying to buy his affections.",False,False

He already told me he wants this ""Lego Friends"" set which lets you build a hair salon for Christmas, so I got it last month.

I thought that gift was taken care of, but since I told my aunt and sent her pictures, she's been asking me to exchange it for a more boyish Lego set, as this one is mostly pink/purple and looks girly.

I don't want to because my cousin specifically told me he wants this hair salon set, yet my aunt argues he won't care and he'll be happy with any Legos at all, so I should gift him more appropriate ones.

I think she's being ridiculous and just cares too much about image, ""what will the neighbors think"" and all that small town bullshit. For example, she was once worried the kid will turn out wrong because he prefers drawing over playing sports.

So do you believe I'm TA if I don't change the gift even though my cousin's mom asked me to?",False,False
1,"AITA for agreeing with my brother when he told my boyfriend he should not talk during family arguments? | I'm 24 and boyfriend is 27. We've been dating for 2 years and a half. We always talked about our family issues very openly and between us we always gave some sort of insight to each other. Still, I never dared to say something directly his family and I always thought he would never do something like this either. 

We went to dinner yesterday at my parents and my younger brother arrived almost at the end of it. My brother and my parents are having issues so this turned into a huge argument. I had already told my boyfriend about what was going on before and he decided to get in the middle of the argument. 

This set off my brother even more and he told my boyfriend that it was not his place to say anything because the issue did not concern him or me. It was between him and our parents and regardless of what I told my boyfriend he still knew nothing about it to speak so freely. At this point I was completely mortified because I could see that my parents were not pleased either. I ended up saying that I wanted to go home and so we did. 

During the car ride my boyfriend asked why I didn't say anything. I told him that my brother was right, it wasn't even my place to say something, much less his place to get into an argument like this. He then said that if it was his family and I he would have said something since he would like me to speak my mind. I told him that I would never do something like this because it was inappropriate and at the end of the day it had nothing to do with us. He tried to argue that the moment my brother said something to him it became an issue with us but I told him he only got what he deserved for inserting himself into something that he should never had.

So now I'm getting the cold shoulder treatment from him and the last thing he said was that we should start keeping family issues out of our relationship.",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I distance myself from my niece? | I feel like I shouldn’t need to ask because of course I would be the asshole if I did this but I thought I would ask this sub for judgement just in case.

I have a three year old niece. When my sister went back to work after her daughter was born, the whole family kinda pitched in the help with childcare so they didn’t have to use a daycare. Her mother in law and our mother each looked after her for a few days a week. Eventually, with my extreme reluctance, I was rope in to help babysit maybe a total of seven day a month, sometimes more. Some of those day were super long, like eight hour days and I did this for about a year and a half. Somehow I become my niece’s favorite person during this time.

But I hate children. I’m childfree for a reason. And I’m not exactly big on my niece either but I suck it up because I’m adult enough to play nice with a small kid to help out my sister. But lately, it’s become harder and harder to do this. I’m not her mother so I defer to my sister in every case but it seems like the more I spend time with my niece the more my sister thinks I’m doing things wrong. Or saying the wrong things. I have to police all my actions and my words just in case my niece takes it the wrong way or it doesn’t align with her parents’ parenting plans and I am feeling judged for not knowing better.

Like yesterday we went to the park together. I was with my niece on the jungle gym and we were climbing it together. I got to a point where I wasn’t comfortable going any higher and I said “I’m going to go down because it’s scary” and immediately my niece didn’t want to go up any higher because she heard that and started parroting it. And now my sister is mad because I traumatized her daughter and peer pressured her daughter into limiting her possibilities because the person her daughter looked up to thought it was too scary. Okay, I’ll refrain from commenting about things being scary from now on if it’s damaging my niece so badly.

Things like this seem to be happening more and more but I’m starting to wondering if it’s really worth it. She’s not my kid, I don’t actually have a duty to be around her if anything I do or say is bad. I don’t even like kids and the way my niece is so fixated on me drives me a bit insane but I can suck it up because she’s a kid and I can eventually go home.

1,"AITA for prohibiting my daughter from wearing an oversized t-shirt over extremely short shorts in public? | My daughter has always dressed modestly before. She came back home after a semester of college and has been wearing some questionable outfits. Last week, she wore a zip up jacket with nothing underneath to meet up with her friends. I told her that was inappropriate to go out in public in and to wear something under that. She said I was making a big deal out of nothing and went out like that. My husband said he didn’t think her outfit was inappropriate. 


Yesterday, my daughter was planning to meet up with her friends wearing an oversized t-shirt over extremely short shorts. The t-shirt covers her entire shorts when she’s standing up and you can almost see her entire thigh. I told her that she couldn’t leave the house dressing like that. She told me again that I’m making a big deal out of nothing and many of her friends dress like this too and it’s really in right now. I put my foot down this time and told her that I wouldn’t stand to have her turn into a floozy before my eyes and she needs to change into a more appropriate outfit if she wanted to leave the house. She argued with me for a while and even called me an old hag, but ultimately changed into skinny jeans and left. 


She told my husband about this last night. He said that he sees women dressing like that all the time and doesn’t see why I’m making such a big deal about this, especially since our daughter is an adult now. I said that just because other girls her age dress like floozies doesn’t mean she has to or should. My husband kept telling me to just let her dress how she likes since it’s really not a big deal, doesn’t make her look like a floozy, and it’s better for our mother-daughter relationship if I give her full autonomy. I agreed to disagree on the floozy point, however I reluctantly agreed to let my daughter wear whatever she wanted in public because I didn’t want her to hate me anymore. 


My husband told me later to apologize to her too, but I made it clear to him that I didn’t think I did anything wrong. In fact, I told him that my daughter is the one that should be apologizing for being flippant when I expressed my disapproval of her outfits. My husband said I was very stubborn and just told me to let her dress however she likes. My daughter is still purposely being very aloof around me.",False,False

For instance, people parking in front of dropped kerbs, people leaving their bins in the middle of the pavement and people parking their cars taking up half the pavement. This means that I then have to go out of my way to find a way around the obstruction, often having to go on the road, which is obviously dangerous.

My neighbour has a 'ground covering' plant on either end of the footpath leading up to his house, and he doesn't often trim it back, so its always spreading onto the pavement. He also parks his car outside his house, again half on the road and half on the pavement, so I can't get through. His son does the same. For me to go around his car I would have to go in the middle of a very busy road, which would be very dangerous.

I have had numerous polite conversations with him, asking him to cut back the plants and park more responsibly but he never listens and the other day he responded with a really bad attitude and slammed the door on me. He says that he doesn't want to park entirely on the road incase his car gets damaged and that he can't cut the plants back at the moment because that would cause them to die. Stupid, crap excuses. 

So, on my way back to my house I was very annoyed and rather than doing what I normally do, which is go on the road, I ran straight over the plant, crushing it. A few hours later my neighbour knocked on my door saying that I could have gone around the car and that I deliberately destroyed his plant, and that he wants me to pay for the damages.

I am going to get married soonish to a lovely woman, or rather was. I have had lots of issues in life, just about certain lifestyles I’ve had in the past, a real party type kid and in that time I had many relationships and one-night stands.

This was a really long time ago and I’ve changed since then into a more mature man, and have committed myself to this woman I love, but recently, I bumped into an Ex while on a work trip and she had a 10 year old with her, and I was very sure it was mine. My co-worker eventually pieced it together and he knows too. 

My Ex had changed a lot too and became a mature woman herself, so we caught up and she told me that I was the father of her child and I feel like my world has turned upside down. She opted to not tell me, because of the lifestyle I had lived. 

This is big, and I wanted to tell my fiancé but my Ex told me if I wanted to have a relationship with my son, that nobody could know I was the father, I guess out of embarrassment or something, and that included my fiancé. 

I was devasted, but of course I wanted a relationship with him so I decided not to tell my fiancé.

1,"AITA For Embarassing A Girl In Front Of Her Crush | Some background here, I am a rather tall girl among my classmates. The sports I train on also makes me a little bit bulky and my skin a little darker and rougher. I have short hair and often dress tomboyishly(is that a word?), also occasionally apply makeups to make my features more masculine to the point of getting mistaken as a guy by strangers sometimes. It is nothing complicated really, I just find myself looking better this way as I look awkwardly like a drag queen if I dress like a girl.


While my whole class knows about me, there is one particular girl who(serious or joking) always assume that I am either a lesbian or a FTM in the making. She spoke as if it's already fact and decided without considering my opinion. When I confront her about this, her reply was ""But (my name), you play rough sports, you dress like a boy, you hang out with boys!"" And suggest me to sort out my own identity myself, which I rolled my eyes and just left her be, we were not close enough to be discussing my identity anyway. 


There's recently a new guy who joined the class, a rather handsome one, I must say. We were introducing ourselves to him one by one as he walked around. When it was my turn, right after I told him my name, the girl called out :""Don't get your hopes up, she's a gay!"" And the whole class laughed.


I may be laughing along but in fact I was quite irritated. So I walked up to her, announced: ""Yups, and meet (her name), my girlfriend."" And gave her a  quick peck on the lips. She could not break free before the contact because I am much stronger than her, you know. The class then laughed again with cheers and claps and the new guy joined them. That girl though, after the initial shock, ran out of the classroom.


I heard later from the other girls that she developed a love on first sight with the new guy, and I completely ruined the first impression. According to them she had been crying in the toilet for hours(not true, she came back when the class starts but I get that exaggeration) My own friends were saying that I went overboard, and I feel a little sorry for that. Buuuut, it was not that she didn't ruin my first impression with the new guy too, even though he was not my type, and she had been assuming my identity for a while before that.

0,"AITA for taking my son's PS4 he bought himself? | Hi all! New here! This situation has been bothering me because I do not know if it was the right decision or not. TL;DR at the end

First, my son, who is 16, got a part time job over this last summer. He raised enough so he can get the family gifts for Christmas and a ps4 for himself. I couldn't buy him one since all my money goes to my parents for personal and financial reasons. We both live with my parents and it's not out of being super poor, but it's comfortable and my parents are very chill.

I work basically a 9 to 5 job, but backwards. 9 to 5... Night shift. So it's hard not to be very not aligned with my family in terms of being awake.

Recently, my son has been doing... Below average in school. I, being a single father, worry about this. My parents spoil my son a bit too much to not care about his grades. They usually throw the ""you should focus more"" line to my son which just goes right by him.

One day, before work, I see what my son is up to and... It's his PS4. He is on it. I haven't noticed much of him playing it until I saw his report card right after mid terms and Christmas break happened. When I saw him I told him that he needs to study more and that the ps4 is making him do less work in school. He tells me not to worry. Me, being stressed a bit before work, snap a little. His grades haven't been doing too well and that I wanted to see his grades on the spot (they have the grades online and I trust him to show me when I ask). But, he hesitated a bit. He said he may have low grades because he still needs to turn some stuff in.

I'm a bit angry at this point. I know I shouldn't have but it didn't change the fact he had low grades. He finally showed me and there was an F! A big ol F in Chemistry. It's a hard class I know but, an F! A lot went through my head. Why haven't I been notified by the teacher he's doing this bad?? How come he hasn't asked for help? I always tell him to ask me for anything. Then I asked myself. Is it because he's playing games all the time???

I told him that he needed to give me that PS4 on e spot. We argued a bit. He paid for the ps4 but I paid for his school. I had to head off to work and didn't finish the argument, but the next day while he was at school I took the ps4.

He was angry at me for the first time in his life. Saying that he worked hard for that ps4. I told him about his grades and he said he needed to turn stuff in still. I told him he shouldn't be late in the first place. 

This was only about a week ago. And he still has an F in Chemistry

I told my parents I did this and they said I needed to go easier on him but I disagree.

I told my son I'd give it back once he gets his grades up. But he DID pay for this ps4. It's his. And I took it.

1,"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend (18f) to go to frat parties without me (19m). | Me and my girlfriend are freshmen in college and although we've only been together four months we're moving quite fast and things have been very serious for at least three of those months. I'm not in a frat and my girlfriend isn't in a sorority but she has friends in sororities and occasionally gets invited to frat parties with them,

I have always held that she's free to go to such parties with her friends, but I'm clearly very uncomfortable with it so she has respected my wishes (despite me telling her to go) and not gone to any since we've been together.

Recently though this is putting some strain on out relationship because she very much wants to go to these parties but I can't look her in the eye and say I'm okay with her going. This in turn has made me feel very much like an asshole because I'm in effect keeping her from having fun with her friends.

The thing I can't get over though is what she's gonna enjoy at these parties because although she'll go with her friends, I very much know that once you get there it's literally just dancing - grinding on random dudes - and occasionally hooking up with frat guys. Now I'm secure enough in our relationship that I don't think there's the slightest chance she'd hook up with a frat guy (at least not by choice), but it's basically inevitable that she'll be dancing on some guys as that's literally all there is to do there and it very much makes me uncomfortable. 

Also, she doesn't drink either so it's not just the fun of going out getting drunk with friends, maybe I'm missing something but I really don't see what she could possibly enjoy out of it other than dancing on other guys which doesn't make sense to me since she seems to be very much in love with me and we're very much exclusive.

TLDR: My girlfriend wants to go to frat parties with her friends. This makes me uncomfortable as I don't see what the parties have to offer other than grinding on dudes. I tell her she can go but that it would make me a little uncomfortable. She doesn't go and makes me feel like an asshole for ""not letting her go"". Am I truly the asshole?",False,False

For a first time dog parent I was proud of the amount of time and effort I put into socializing and training BC, and for the first 3 years of his life we were happy as could be. I felt incredibly lucky to have such easy going and eager to please first dog. 

Unfortunately 2 years ago at house party BC had a traumatizing encounter with a child that has caused him to become incredibly nervous and aggrey towards children. In retrospect I should have gotten him into training and addressed the trauma immediately. Instead I avoided children and he quarantined BC in a no-kids area when children were around. 

I recently moved and have started to take BC out and about to dog parks or to explore. BC is a handsome pup with ""hey -- you're my best friend in the whole world!"" energy so we're often approached, especially by children in his high-risk age group. 

When approached I usually something along the lines was of ""Oh, he doesn't like kids"", but half of the time the parent or child will just respond that it's okay, they're good with dogs and then they get snarled at. 

I was complaining to a friend with a rescue who's aggressive towards children as well and they said that they didn't have that experience becuase when they tell people their dog's a rescue and doesn't like kids trauma is assumed.

0,"AITA for not allowing Dad to bring his dog to my house? | My dad adopted a Great Dane and is now calling her his service animal so that he can take her everywhere. This dog is not an actual certified service animal for a medical condition. He just wants to be able to take her everywhere.  
The dog is well behaved except she has attacked smaller dogs a couple of times over the past 3 months. Not just a little bite, she has had a little dog completely in her mouth and been shaking it violently. I have two cats. My dad is offended that I told him that I don’t feel comfortable with him bringing his dog on a weekend visit to my house.  He thinks his dog would be “fine” with cats. The dog had never been around cats and I’m not going to make my cats the test case. 

He actually cancelled coming to my house on Thanksgiving because his dog wasn’t welcome. I think that he should have had a friend watch the dog or board her. He says that service animals should be welcome everywhere. 

AITA? Should I just keep my cats confined to a room and suck it up for the weekend?",False,False
0,"AITA for catching my parents disputes on a video conference when I'm working from home? | 

I am in my early 20s and I have a full time job. I'm living at home right now because, right when cuarantine was starting, I tried to renew my apartment lease and my landlord refused me, saying he was selling the building for condos. 

So with all the shutdowns, I wasn't able to find a new apartment in time and my parents let me move back in. It's really not ideal and I've actually signed a new apartment lease that starts in a month. I wish it was sooner but housing near me is very competitive.

My parents have always had a very disfunctional relationship. But they won't leave each other. No matter how much drama they have, I think they've lived like this too long to consider anything else.  

I have my work setup in the formal dining room which is rarely used. The room opens to the main entry hallway, and there is no door there. So there's less privacy than I'd prefer.

I was hosting a meeting this morning and several of my coworkers were attending. They're all actually good friends of mine outside of work too; close enough friends that I've told them about my tumultuous childhood, my stresses moving back in with my family, etc.

So when my parents came in the door in a full blown screaming match, in full view of the camera, I wasn't too shaken. First, unfortunately, that kind of thing has been really normalized for me, it doesn't register as a big deal. Second, it wasn't like the people in the meeting didn't already know my parents were high-tempered.

So I just said ""Hold on, can you still hear me? Not well? Sorry. Let's just take a coffee break then pick up from there.""

A couple people got up but my coworker Dan who's a good friend of mine stayed and asked me if I was all good. I said yeah, this shit was normal for all my life, I was just annoyed at the timing but I wasn't scared or some shit. My other co-workers trickled back in.

My parents were still going hog wild in the hallway, and I eventually said ""hey could yall keep it down, I'm presenting for a meeting.""

My dad saw that they were on camera first, and got really mad at me. Yelling at me to get the fuck out of his house.

I went out to my car and took my laptop and finished the meeting in there. But when I came back in my parents were both over yelling at each other for the moment and they were both furious at me for ""filming a private family matter for everyone to see"" and shit like that.

 I said that I wasn't trying to film them, I was on camera myself because I was doing a presentation and they walked right in and started screaming. And if they'd stopped to think or look around at all they'd see I was trying to work quietly.

My parents kicked me out and I'm at a hotel now. My parents want an apology and I don't know what to do. I think I might to keep the peace but I don't really feel bad for what I did.

0,"AITA for not letting elderly people ahead of me at the pharmacy? | A week ago, I was in another city getting a prescription at Walgreens. I waited for a few people, and eventually I was at the front of the line. A woman with a walker comes up behind me. I'm guessing she's 85-90. Then, another older woman (maybe 70) comes up behind her. The latest woman in the line loudly announces that the other woman should go to the drop off to get her refills faster because ""SOME PEOPLE"" don't let ""PEOPLE LIKE THEM"" through the line. She said she usually can get her prescriptions faster that way.
I ignored the whole interaction, and watched the pharmacist get flustered when she tried to fill at the wrong window. I chalked the whole thing up to a different culture, and assumed I was an asshole in that context (the area was near the Mexican border, whereas I'm in a super white Midwest suburb).

Today, in my hometown, a similar incident occurred. I was in line at Walgreens, and a 70-ish woman asked if I was in line. I told her I was. She sighed loudly and pushed her cart NEXT to me in the line. When I got called up, she acted like she was going to go ahead of me. I glared at her, and continued to the window.

Is this some kind of obvious etiquette? AITA? I honestly worry that I'd never get out of Walgreens if I let every old person ahead of me, but maybe that's the normal thing to do? ",False,False
0,"AITA for not giving into my older roommate's demands about my gf? | For context, I'm a 23 year old living in a subletted room of an apartment of a 43 year old professor. No contract, I just give her money each month. When i moved in, I told her that my girlfriend stays overnight twice a week. She said no problem to this. My girlfriend and I are both very quiet and friendly, and we mostly keep to ourselves by watching TV in my room. She's been spending more time during the day on Saturdays (like she'll be in my room Saturday afternoon - Sunday afternoon), but she's actually only stayed overnight once a week since I've lived here. We try to invite my roommate to go places whenever we go out, but she always says no. When I first met my roommate my girlfriend did nOT spend this much time at my old apartment, but since I've moved closer to her we now can spend more time together. So my life has just slightly changed since moving to this apartment, I promise I didn't intentionally omit how much she spends in the apartment. Total, she's probably IN MY ROOM with the door closed for 20 hours a week including sleeping.

My roommate also didn't tell me that there's a chore list of about 50 things that needs to get done every week. No problem, I'm happy to do it if it'll make her happy and make the apartment look nice. I've also driven dinner over to her office when she's been stressed about work. i've tried to be nice.

We're both super busy so my girlfriend comes over once during the weekday from 8:30 - 10:30, and then she comes over to my room on Saturday afternoon around 2, we'll go get some food for a few hours because it stresses my roommate that my girlfriend is in my room. Then we'll come back and watch TV for the rest of the night in my room. GF's then there until Sunday around 3 PM. For context, we're now in my room the ENTIRE time with the door closed and the TV on low, but we used to occasionally do homework in the living room or eat in the kitchen. At first, she didn't like us eating in the kitchen or being in the living room (common spaces) when she got home which I totally understood, so she asked us to eat in my room and not cook in the kitchen so no big deal, we now order out and eat in my room. Also, my girlfriend has never showered here, she showers before at her home so she doesn't have to use our water/shower while she's here.

Roommate has confessed that she often can't tell if we're in my room or not unless my gf's car is out on the street because we're quiet.  Fast forward, my roommate's work has gotten really stressful and she now tells me that it bothers her that my girlfriend is in my room on Saturday because she ""can't focus with more than one person in the apartment"" and she asked that my girlfriend leaves by 12 PM. She also asked that I tell her my schedule of when she is and isn't in the apartment. I now give her 24 hours notice and try to tell her our schedule. I'm a little annoyed at this point because I'm trying to be accommodating, but whatever.  We normally leave at like 2 PM now to go to the library on Sundays because i'm not gonna have a curfew imposed on me at 23, but i'm doing my best.

Now the kicker. What really hurt was that one of my students (I teach 2nd grade in a bad neighborhood) was shot and killed instantly on a Friday. I text my roommate that my gf and I will be in my room all day Saturday because I'm mourning and crying and grieving because you know, my kid was a victim of gun violence. She says she's sorry and blah blah blah, she's nice. THEN Sunday at around 2 PM, I manage to leave the apartment and an hour later (3 PM) while we're out, I get this text message. 

""if possible I’d prefer that you and gf not spend more time here together today. I’m not feeling well and it stresses me out when you guys are here on the weekends, especially since lately it seems to be the whole weekend and not just overnight. I understand you wanted more time yesterday but you did not ask for today and I’ve already asked before that you and Koryne not stay past noon on Sundays. This is my home and I need to have a space in which I feel comfortable."" 

When I saw that text, i just broke down crying. It definitely not the whole weekend? I was heartbroken that someone could be so unforgiving when she knew I was upset about my kid dying. 

it's not just her home, I also pay rent here. I don't know. AMTA? I'm tearing up while re-reading that text. I'm moving out at the end of December which I'm very thankful for, I'm just nervous for these next few weeks. My job is really hard sometimes ( re: my student died) and my girlfriend is my rock through it all. I can't do this without her. Also I keep saying in my room because whether or not my girlfriend is there, I'm in my room with the door closed. So it doesn't really affect the roommate in anyway. 

TL;DR Roomate was ok with gf staying over twice a week, she's actually not. She gave me a list of 50 things to clean every week and I do them. She didn't like us in common spaces so we don't hang out there anymore. She told me to give her my schedule so she know's when we'll be in the apartment and I've done that. I've tried to be accommodating to my roommate about my girlfriend, and roommate was ok with my girlfriend until her work got stressful. She sent a really cold heartless text to me about my girlfriend being in my room 2 days after one of my 7-year-old students was shot. AITA? ",False,False
1,"AITA For telling my brother and his wife they can't afford to have a baby? | Throwaway. I am posting this because my relationship with my brother is in jeopardy and I need to know if I am being an asshole/fair.

My brother is a recovering alcoholic and has been sober for 3 years. He had a harder life than I did, we both went to college, but he dropped out after one semester and everything went downhill from there. He started drinking, lived paycheck to paycheck, etc. 

He has been cleaning himself up and met a girl (whom I am not too crazy about, she's the type to get lots of tattoos and whatnot, not a great influence). They ended up marrying last year. 

Even though my brother seems happy and better, they are still poor and live in a cramped apartment with a roommate, barely getting by. Last week we were all over my parents house and my brother told everyone that they have an announcement; his wife is pregnant.

Everyone said the usual ""congratulations,"" I stayed silent and after the surprise wore down, I took my brother to the next room over and said ""you can't be serious? You're having a child when you keep having money problems?""

He got mad at me and told me his situation was none of my business. He shouted at me which caused everyone in the next room to overhear. I got mad and told him ""it's unfair to the child to have to grow up in such shitty conditions because you're irresponsible.""

We argued and everyone tried to intervene to get us to stop. My brother said to me that I am just jealous of him because I can't find a girl who likes me, I told him at least I am not poor. It was an ugly exchange of words unfortunately. 

My brother and his wife decided to leave and I shouted out to them ""enjoy the bus ride home!"" while he told me to go f myself, just to show how bad the argument got.

Me, my parents and sister had a talk. My sister agreed that they shouldn't have a baby, my parents said it's not our place to decide that.",False,False

I have the living room furniture arranged a specific way that makes sense to me (I don't like having my back to the windows when I watch TV). She wants to rearrange it because she thinks it's ugly. I said I'd be willing to compromise but that I have the furniture arranged for specific practical reasons and just because something looks aesthetically pleasing doesn't mean it works well in the space.

0,"AITA for taking my ex to court for back child support? | My ex and I divorced in 2008. We have 4 kids together. Short version of the why is that he knocked up his girlfriend while they were deployed (and still married to me).  At the time, my oldest was 15 and youngest was 8. 
Child support was always an issue. He wanted to pay into separate bank accounts for each of the children so that he wouldn’t have to pay me at all. That’s not how this works.. so he paid me. BUT, he paid me what he felt like he should pay and not what the court order stated... 
Fast forward to this passed Monday- we’re in court because 1. I finally had the money to take him to court and 2. The kids are older and not as likely to get pulled into this. (Side note: I’ve kept all this BS from them all this time so that they didn’t have to feel like they had to choose sides)
So, we’re in court.. my two oldest kids walk in with my ex.. planning to testify that THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN A DIME OF CHILD SUPPORT COME TO THEM FROM ME... 
I’m devastated. I am still in shock and total disbelief. 
Ex has been sporadically present during their childhood and never sent Christmas or birthday presents/cards.. nothing. The three times he’s had them for Christmas in the ten years we’ve been divorced is the only time they’ve received any gifts of any kind. 
So... before we get in front of the judge and shit goes down- ex tells his lawyer to tell my lawyer that he does in fact owe me exactly how much I’ve claimed and just wants to set up a payment plan. 
The kids haven’t made eye contact with me or acknowledged me in any way the entire time. 8hrs. Nothing.
We get out of court... I’ve discovered that my kids have blocked me from all social media, disconnected from my Netflix account, blocked my number on their phones, stopped sharing location on the phones... basically cut me off without saying a freaking word to me.  
So why am I the asshole for taking him to court? What did I do to warrant being shut out of their lives? I raised them and gave them everything they needed and wanted even when I couldn’t afford it. I found a way. I went without more times than I can count so that they would have what they needed.... they’re all good students and I’ve put three into and through college. The oldest went into the army instead.

Our son loves Christmas and always goes crazy with excitement. So up until now I’ve gone along with my wife on it. Out Well a couple nights ago it was just our son and I home at night, my wife was out with her friends.

He then started getting upset about it and I tried calming him down telling him that he will still get everything that he wants. I didn’t see the problem with it because I was being honest with him and I don’t wanna deceive him. A couple hours later my wife comes home and of course he runs over to her and tells her about it.

For whatever reason, I keep them neatly cataloged by year and it's a nice personal collection for me. I also love seeing how confident I've become over the years.

When my boyfriend found out about this (we were scrolling pics on my phone and he wanted to see more, so I navigated and shared) he got livid! He told me it wasn't nice that I was keeping pics I had taken for other guys with me. He thought it was only polite for people to delete nudes when they break up. 

I reminded him this was true OF THE OTHER PERSON, not me!! I love some of these pics but he says it'll always be with the context of me wanting to sleep with other guys. I told him I'm not having this discussion and decided to end it.

0,"WIBTA for asking my uncle to move out of my apartment? | I (27F) have lived in a 2 bedroom apartment since September of 2019. My roommate (24F) moved out shortly after Thanksgiving to move in with her boyfriend.

The agreement between my roommate and I was that she didn't have to pay rent, as long as we could split the electric and utilities bill. Also, I'm in a wheelchair. If I needed something during the night, like a drink of water, or if there were ever a fire or I got violently ill, it was understood that she'd help me out. So long as she followed our agreement, she could live rent-free in a $2700/month apartment in a desirable area that she'd been looking to move to. She stayed with me while she got her feet on the ground, then her ex moved back town and they got back together, and she moved in with him. (I have mixed feelings about the timing of it all, but I digress.)

Around the same time, my mom's younger brother (53M) had to temporarily leave his home because the well that provided his water supply had dried up. Without a second thought, I offered up the spare bedroom. My uncle has spent the last several years being down on his luck; he can't seem to hold on to a job for more than six months, and his living situation has changed several times throughout the last five years, whether that's because he's been evicted or because he just abandons the place he lives.

He moved into my apartment with the same understanding. I even covered the cost of utilities and electric until he got a job. The only thing I asked was if I needed help in the middle of the night, could he please help me. Of course he agreed. He's known me all my life and knows that I need help with certain things.

However, there's a very ugly side to his personality and it came out very quickly. I've struggled with depression for all of my adult life. He's made comments that depression isn't real, and that I'm smart enough to just get over it on my own without counseling or my antidepressants. He makes snide comments about my brother, who I love more than anyone in the world. He says that if it weren't for me, my brother and I wouldn't have a relationship because my brother doesn't put any effort into our relationship.


That's just the tip of the iceberg. And the few times I've asked him for help he makes me feel so guilty. I feel like I'm a burden. Not just to him, but to everyone. And it's starting to mess with me.

I'd feel awful asking him to move out, but I'm also really starting to feel awful about myself too. I don't know what to do.",False,False
1,"AITA for telling a masseuse that her fingers smelled like butt? | Throwaway because this is embarrassing - not a joke.

So I have a habit of just speaking my mind - I don’t sugar coat anything. I’m not a jerk about it, I’m very honest and proud of that. I also have a bit of a “potty mouth.”

Today I was at the spa having a massage & facial done as a treat. First things first, the masseuse had bad breath. It was kinda gross but since we only talked for a couple minutes before the treatment I decided to let it slide.

Unfortunately during my facial I noticed a bad...odor. Like I said, I don’t sugar coat - when her fingers came by my nose, it smelled like #2. It made me gag.

I didn’t wanna embarrass her so I decided to make a joke out of it, because obviously I had to say SOMETHING. This is what I said (in a jokey way remember): “Hey did your last massage client ask you to finger their butthole or something?”

She seemed really confused and weirded out so I asked again. Finally I had to explain that her fingers basically, to me, smelled like sh**. 

She got upset and went and got her manager who asked me to leave. I didn’t wanna make a scene so I did leave, but I argued with them first - 

1) I was paying for a service 
2) I expect the spa and it’s employees to be clean
3) I don’t actually BELIEVE she fingers peoples buttholes, but what if she went to the bathroom and didn’t wash her hands? I don’t want that on my face.

Anyway my husband thinks I was being rude or whatever - I disagree obviously although I won’t be going back.

For some reason they decided to get a chocolate cake with chocolate fudge frosting. When they tried to give me a piece I told them I don't eat chocolate. They said since it was my birthday and they got it for me that I had to have a piece, and I refused and reminded them I've always hated chocolate. It turned into an argument with us going back and forth with them telling me I had to have some and that just one piece won't kill me, and me refusing and saying I hate chocolate and can't bring myself to eat anything chocolate that even the thought of it makes me sick.

0,"AITA for being angry about not going on holiday? | I feel deceived and sad.

I've(27F) been with my fiance(31M) for 5 years. We didn't go on any sort of trip during all those years - mainly because I've been stuck at university the first few years we've been together and then when I started working I didn't get any holiday or vacation leave simply because I needed money, I've been saving money to buy a flat. Fast forward few years, I have a flat, I have a car and we're living very comfortably. It's also the first time I got my vacation leave at work so we planned on going somewhere abroad. 

And there's the problem - we're not going anywhere. 

He has a younger sister, she's 28 and totally incapable of taking care of herself. She didn't go to university, doesn't want to work, she's still supported by their mother. Mind you, she lives a very prestigious lifestyle so often it comes to a situation when she doesn't have money for essential things like rent or bills. When she doesn't have money and her mother can't give her more, she asks my fiance. We argued a lot about it, because often he'll give her money and then he can't buy something for himself. After our last argument he agreed to stop all financial support until she gives back the money she already owes. It is about 2000$ at this moment, it may be more maybe I wasn't informed. 

He lied. He gave her money again and only admitted it after I confronted him about her recent calls. I knew it would happen, we talked about it a lot before - she's going to Brazil and has a hard time financing it, her mother wouldn't give her the whole sum. And she asked him again, lying she needs money for rent. Long story short we argued a lot about it, I was really angry he lied to me. When I cooled down after a week or so, the topic of our trip came up... And well, then it hit him that he can't afford it anymore because of current expenses. Basically he gave her money that he saved for holiday.

Am I really in the wrong here though? I just wanted to have something nice after years of working my ass off. Is it really this much, going somewhere nice for once?

0,"AITA for seeing family my mother has denied me access to? | The title is very oversimplified so let me explain. Hang in there, because it's going to be a long explanation.

Up until my parents got divorced, we had a great relationship with my moms side of the family. They'd come visit at least 4 times a year and we always went to my grandmother's house in Florida over spring break. Seeing them was always my favorite part of the year and there was never any issues with it.

Now, when my parents got divorced my mom decided she didn't want me and my siblings to have any communication with her side if the family. She sent a lot of angry, untrue emails about my dad to her side of the family, but they took my dad's side. My dad thought she was just angry because of that and would let up on it soon enough (she's known to make bad, rash decisions when upset). Keeping that in mind, he allowed her to put it in the divorce contract with the assumption the it would be dropped after a few weeks.

It's been almost 9 years and I miss my family. I haven't seen any of my mother's side, including my grandparents, for almost a decade. But recently, my dad took us on a vacation to Florida. I am almost at the age where the divorce contract will have no legal hold over me, so I went to visit my grandmother (she lived nearby).

I've never been given a straight answer as to why I'm not allowed to see them. My mother told me once that I wasn't allowed to see her sister because she was ""a heroin addict"" (totally not true) and that my grandma ""called me a bitch"" (also not true and definitely not a reason to ex-communicate your family), so I've always been confused and thought that this rule was ridiculous. My mom refuses to tell me the real reason why and I'm beginning to believe she doesn't actually have a substantial one. I've never had a bad experience with anyone from her side, and I feel like that that it's my desicion to make, especially seeing as it's basically to the point where I don't have to follow the contract anyway.

When we got back she asked if I'd seen them and I said yes (I didn't want to lie to her) and she went ballistic. I understand that I went against her wishes, and I get that it wasn't cool, but there was no reasoning behind why I couldn't. As I said before she's always changed the subject in a way that leads me to believe that she doesn't actually have a reason and it's just so she feels like she has power over me. So AITA?

Note: I've brought up changing the agreement on multiple occasions but always get shut down. I'm never given the chance to explain my side. I never fought it too much because it would mean I'd have to fight her in court, which I really don't want to do. She has a knack for cutting off contact with people who she gets angry at, especially if they didn't do anything wrong (ex. my step-siblings that aren't allowed at her house) and going to court would definitely be cause to cut me off. She's still my mother and I want to be able to see her.",False,False

This lasted a few months until a few weeks ago when she became annoyed that I wouldn't take the dog for walks, feed it, or clean up after it when it shit in the kitchen a few times.

And for a child hearing that from his mother, that is so devastating. I am 14 now, and she still acts the same way. She scolded me for not greeting her a Happy Mother's Day an hour after telling me that I'm useless and that I should change when really she just didnt see my change.

In my eyes, if I don’t want to go then I shouldn’t have to. One of my friends said I was being an ass and the other one sided with me? 

Me (30f) and my sister (28f) have always a bad relationship because she was always purposefully upsetting me and the final straw was her wedding. She purposefully planned her wedding to be before mine just so she can brag about being the first sibling to be married 

I decided I was done playing her games and I no longer want to attend. Our other sister (27f) is saying that I’m being immature and that I HAVE to go because I RSVP’d already but I know sister and her bf have not paid for the final numbers yet and my pulling out won’t hit them financially.

Today as I left for work she complained that I needed to stop leaving butter out cause she had to buy 3 new big tubs this week cause I keep forgetting. 

I pretended to react super offended and didn’t talk for a few hours. I was gonna come home with some of her fav food and surprise her that I wasn’t mad. She messaged me asking what was wrong and I told her I don’t like to be verbally abused over butter. She got really upset and told me she was sick of me and that I was selfish and not good for her ‘mental health’. I told her it was a joke but she needed to apologize because now she actually upset me calling me selfish when I’m sensitive to stuff like that. She blocked me on everything. I’ve joked like this before and she just rolled her eyes so idk why she unnecessarily blew up this time.

I found a makeup artist that does hair + makeup for only $120, and by the looks of her page, I thought she did a great job.

So I get to her studio, and she does my makeup, and everything looks great. Then, I noticed that she added eyelashes, but I didn’t ask for any (also I didn’t get to pick the style - they were way too long and dramatic for me). I assumed that they were included in the $120 so I didn’t say anything. Afterwards, when she was starting on my hair, she kept telling me how thick it was, which I took as a compliment. Mid-way through curling my hair, though, she tells me that because my hair is so thick, and will probably take more than 1 hour to do, she is charging an extra $20. I told her that I didn’t bring that much cash, and that I would’ve just done my own hair if I knew that she was going to charge an extra $20. She stayed quiet and I didn’t say anything more either. At the end of the session, she told me that my total was $165 because of the extra hair cost (which did not even take an hour) and the eyelashes, which I hated on me. I told her again that I didn’t bring that much cash, and she told me to etransfer the rest to her. I got angry and I told her that she is overcharging me, and how it was unfair because she didn’t disclose the hidden prices to me beforehand. She told me that the extra costs are my fault, because I didn’t ask if the price was included while she put the eyelashes on.

1,"AITA for changing my daughter’s visitation schedule once? | I had my first child, Jessica, with my ex-wife when I was just 20 years old. We divorced, and I let my ex-wife take full custody and move into the neighboring state (I regret this now but lacked resources to fight). I visited when I could and when Jessica was old enough she would come to visit for her summer breaks.

Eventually I met my current wife, a wonderful woman who had no problems at all with Jessica visiting. We fell in love and we even had Jessica fly in to be the flower girl at our wedding. She was very happy for us and all was well.

My wife fell pregnant soon after and we realized that her due date would fall in July, right in the middle of Jessica’s usual visitation. We contacted my ex wife and explained that my wife would be due during the visit and we would not be able to care for Jessica, but she would be welcome to visit for Spring Break.

My ex exploded (we were fairly civil before this) and demanded that we make accommodations, like having my brother and his wife take in Jessica while my wife labored. I explained that labor wasn’t the only concern, because my wife would be dealing with hormones and learning to be a mom, and I would have to return to work quickly so it would be all on my wife.

When Jessica visited next, she asked me why she couldn’t visit before, and if I would send away her baby sister when I eventually have a second. I told her that we did the best we could.

The next year my ex wife told me that Jessica wanted to stay home to focus on her studies. She never came back for another summer, instead visiting briefly around the holidays, and not even every year. She has been much colder, and I think my ex has had a large role in that.

In my mind we were simply being realistic. It wouldn’t have been fair to Jessica to be here in the chaos of a new baby, and it wouldn’t have been fair to my wife to make her care for a child that wasn’t hers when she was so vulnerable. In literally all other cases she treated Jessica like one of her own. Likewise, at the time my brother was a flake, so leaving her with them was not an option.

I ask this now because Jessica just turned 18. I called her up and asked if we could put the past behind us and begin again, as adults. She said she had no interest in making a relationship with someone who wasn’t even family to her.

I told her she was malicious and that she has chosen to hold a grudge for years. I said I would never be able to be worthy to her, and that I was done going through that pain. If she wanted a relationship I would be there, but I wouldn’t force it.

1,"UPDATE: AITA for forcing myself to bond with my boyfriend/fiance's daugher? | [Original post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c60m3b/aita_for_forcing_myself_to_bond_with_my/).

I read over the replies to the post and thought really hard about it, although I admit I was often argumentative and didn't really want to listen for the most part. 

Meanwhile, my fiance's daughter came home shortly after I wrote the post. I asked her what she thought of her dad and I getting married, and she said she couldn't wait to spend more time with me and all. 

I opened up and became super honest about my anxieties going into the marriage--how I didn't know how my role would change in her/our family and how I was scared I wasn't ready to be a mom to her and her brother.

She reassured me that my role wouldn't change much and that ""I was already the closest thing to a mom she ever had."" I kinda started crying when she said that, and then she started crying too.

Since her birthday is coming up soon (I always get her a card and write her something meaningful), I've also started to reflect upon all the memories we've shared: all the heavy personal stuff she's talked about with me, her soccer games and her teams' wins and losses, her dance shows, her late night phone calls from college (both happy and sad), etc. 

Now that I'm more clear on what she wants/expects from me after her dad and I get married, I think I've come to realize that yes, at first, I did sort of have to ""force myself"" to bond with her, especially when our relationship was on the rocks. 

But I've really come to love and appreciate my boyfriend's daughter, even through all the arguments and her initial teenage behaviors. Without her, I wouldn't get nearly as many hugs or as much love, and more importantly, I'd have missed out on getting really close with someone as intelligent, talented, and passionate as she is. 

When she was away for the past month or so at school/traveling for the summer, I actually *really* missed her and know that my life wouldn't be the same without her. I missed her hugs, love and her snarky commentary on our favorite shows. I love all the hugs/appreciation I've gotten from her, but she's enriched my life in so many ways. 

So no, Reddit, my boyfriend and I are not getting divorced or breaking off the engagement anytime soon. But thank you for making me really reflect on my thoughts/potential behaviors towards her. I know see how suddenly withholding love could really be harmful towards someone who's gotten close to me (and someone I've grown really close to also).

0,"AITA for telling my brother if I'm lazy for not working, so is he? | Throwaway - don't this on my main.

I am a 21F in university. I will be taking courses in the summer after a 4 month 'break' to do an internship with a company as part of my degree program. It was a paid internship, and my pay was decent - I made more than double what I had made in the previous 1 1/2 years working part-time.

I decide I saved up enough money that I wouldn't work part-time and take classes over the summer. I'm taking 4 classes, 3 of them quite difficult, so I decided it would be best to take a break from working this semester and focus on my courses. I'm close (ish) to graduating and these courses are very important for my degree. After next semester I'll probably be taking 3 courses in each semester until I graduate so I figure I will be able to work. I do not pay rent but pay all my own expenses at my parents house as well as my tuition. They agree with my decision to focus on courses next semester. 

My brother (30M) is a teacher. In Canada, teachers can either choose to get paid for 12 months of the year (at a slightly lower amount per paycheque) or 10 months of the year (the time spent actually working since they have summers off). My brother chose the 12 month option, and doesn't work during the summer. He has no kids. 

I don't think there's anything wrong with the way my brother chooses to work/get paid. But the other day when he stopped by the house, he asked me about my university plans and I told him. He scoffed and said I would be 'lazy for not working part-time' while I took those courses. I told him he was not in the same degree program as I am and these courses are difficult to balance, and regardless, I saved up enough money from the past 4 months it was basically like I was 'working' since I did have money to use during the semester for my necessities. He reiterated that he thought it was a bad idea he thinks mom and dad should 'put a stop to.' I reminded him he didn't work during the summer because he had cash flow coming in despite not going to work which was similar to my situation, and if I'm lazy for not working this summer, so is he.

He said our situations were completely different and I shouldn't bring it up because at least he's self-sufficient and not relying on mom and dad. I feel like complete shit about myself, but I AM 10 years younger than my brother and he lived at home until he was 25.

0,"AITA for turning off the stove when my roommate leaves? | My roommate has started to do a fair amount of cooking. I came home last night and realized the oven was on and my roommate was out. 

I sent a text saying they’d left the oven on and they asked if I could just keep an eye on things until they got back, I said it was fine. I figured this was a one time thing. 

A couple days later the stove was going with a pot and I sent another text. They said “I know, I’ll be back in half an hour.” 

I said I couldn’t watch it and had to be leaving myself. They said it was fine to leave it on. That’s unsafe and I was definitely not going to walk out and wait for the house to burn down. I said “I’m turning this off when I leave.” 

They said they’d be back in 20 minutes and it wasn’t a big deal. I had no way of knowing whether that was true or not. Especially considering they’d already been gone two hours. I didn’t doubt them because they’re disingenuous, just because things come up. Traffic, passing the supermarket and realizing you need something, getting caught up in a phone call, whatever. In the time it took to do any of those, a fire could start. 

I turned it off. This resulted in a long and heated (no pun intended) argument about fire safety when they got back. They said it was ridiculous for them to have to stay home when something is just baking or simmering and doesn’t require anything attention. I said if they want to cook and go out for long stretches, they should get a crock pot. 

Now whenever they go out and leave the stove on or a pot on, I turn it off. They say I’m an asshole because I turn it off every time they leave the house with the stove or oven on. Even if I’m not planning to leave. If anything because the habit is dangerous, but also, I don’t want to be responsible for remembering it’s there or remembering to switch it off if I decide to leave. That’s not my job, I’m not cooking. 

But a friend was over and saw me turning off the oven with food inside, asked why, I relayed this all to her, and she said it sounded like I was an asshole.

Okay back story: I recently started a new job at a childcare center as the ""kitchen manager""- making breakfast, lunch, snacks, doing prep, dishes, etc. Basically all the kitchen work. I love to cook and bake anyway and this is my first time getting to work in a job that allows me to do that. I've been making things like coffee cake and banana bread and muffins at home on my own time specifically for the staff to munch on throughout the day because everyone has been really welcoming and feeding people is how I show affection. 

Here's the thing-there's a couple staff members with dietary restrictions. One woman has a soy allergy. One has an egg and nut allergy. One is very diabetic. So I've been modifying all my recipes to accommodate them. Today, I was talking to my boss and telling her about the banana bread I brought in this morning-how I had replaced the eggs and sugar without sacrificing the flavor. The woman with diabetes, ""Ann"", must have been right outside the kitchen when I was talking about how I had replaced the sugar and she LOST. HER. SHIT. She started yelling that I must have invaded her privacy to find out she was diabetic and that making things sugar free without talking to her was me ""policing her body"". Flabbergasted, I tried to explain that, as the person making all the food, I have to know *everyone's* food restrictions, both kids and staff. She then called the other 2 staff with food restrictions in to ""expose"" what I had done. The other 2 women said they were already aware that I knew about their restrictions and were grateful that I went out of my way to accommodate them. Ann continued ranting about me policing her and said I was ""shaming"" her. I hate confrontation and when I'm being yelled at, I implode and start crying. My boss was standing right there the whole time trying to help me explain to Ann and, when I started crying, she told Ann to stop screaming and take the rest of the day off. Ann left, but she was messaging and texting the rest of the staff about how horrible I had made her feel. Now the staff is divided-about half think I did nothing wrong and the other half think I should have talked to her and asked if she wanted me to make things sugar free because she's very sensitive about her diabetes being primarily caused by her weight. They also think it's my fault she got sent home, that I was ""overdramaric"" and ""trying to make Ann look bad"" by crying and that I'm an ass because being sent home will be a strike in her file.

TLDR at the bottom.

So I (m30) proposed my amazing girlfriend (f29) (let's call her Hannah) last Tuesday. SHE SAID YES and I'm the happiest man on Earth now. 

However, I've faced an issue. 
See, I proposed at this local amusement park. It was our dating anniversary on Monday, but we celebrated  it on Tuesday and I thought It'd be romantic to go to the amusement park where we had our first date in and propose there. 

I had it all planned up, even asked this one guy to record it. I got down on one knee in front of this huge ferris wheel and asked the question, so there was a lot of people around watching & clapping etc.
She was surprised but happy and said yes. The rest of the night was awesome and we were both happy as can be. 

Yesterday though, Hannah asked me to delete the video. I was confused because I thought the video was super cute. She said me proposing in a public place with people watching & recording was kind of awkward for her, and made her feel a bit pressured, even though she would've said yes in any situation. That's why she asked me to delete the video.

I of course was crushed. In my mind the video was so romantic and cute. After a while I still deleted it, because Hannah insisted. 

The thing is, a few months back she showed me this YouTube video of a guy proposing a girl at a mall or something, and she mentioned how it would give her so much anxiety and pressure if someone proposed to her in public. I remembered this, but I figured maybe she doesn't feel that way anymore, and maybe the romanticity of the situation would take the negative feelings away. 

This was not the case and now I'm debating on this:

Should I apologize to Hannah? I asked my sister and she said I'm an asshole. I, however, don't think so.

I'm a year and a half into my divorce of a husband who I spent 10 years with. It's not finalized yet and we've been sharing custody of our son (6). We divorced due to him cheating with me mutable times with a family friend, he intends to marry now. I've never allowed my own feelings and humiliation damage my son's relationship with his dad. We are both mature between drop ups and picks up, re - scheduling and managing the financial part and have never fought. I've never bad mouthed him, or even mention him around my son despite feelings I'm working through because I know how impressionable he is.

The issue raised though when ex's fiance moved in with her 2 children. She and I use to be close friends, but obviously have no relationship at the moment. I know she speaks badly about me and repeated private things I once confided in my ex husband about to other friends and her older children. Word gets around. Recently my son has been returning home repeating foul language and asked me the definition of words, such as whore, c\*nt, insane etc. When I ask where he picked that vocab up, he says she was saying that what dad's fiance calls you. He then started talking about a swimming pool and mentioned about me going 'into' the deep end. I asked him what he meant about that. He told me again, dad's fiance was saying you going into the deep end, which I assume he meant to say going off the deep end. He asked me if I was going anywhere which I replied no. He mentioned that didn't make sense because she said you're going to leave me after they have the wedding because you'll be too sad.

I will admit, once I realized about the affair I became incredibly depressed and was needing a great deal of therapy so my son spent more time at his father's new place. I really didn't want him to see me like that. Both ex and his fiance became aware of what was going on. I've been doing much better now with the right medication and support, which ex is aware of as well.

The great thing about my older son is that he's helped me financially when I my dog had to have surgery and has taken off work several times to drive me to doctor appointments.

Shortly before he moved out, my wife (their mother), passed away from a chronic illness. While she was alive we were a fairly well off middle-class family. These days I'm barely making it by with my bills. I can usually pay them on time, but I do have a couple outstanding medical bills due to my own health problems. My savings is completely depleted and I'm living off of my fixed retirement income.

I recently told my younger son that still lives at home, I want $200 a month for rent and $60 for his cell phone bill. I decided this a few days after an argument I had with them. The argument was over how he literally spends every moment locked in his room, when he's not working, and never helps around the house. During this argument he told me that he has $10,000 saved up and may move to Europe, where his long-distance girlfriend lives. It shocked me that he has so much money saved up, while I pay for all of his living expenses. He currently doesn't have a car either, so I have to drive him to work each day. He has a license, but when I offered to put him on my insurance for $100/month, he refused.

0,"WIBTA for telling my sister’s husband he’s a jerk only because he told me I’ve put on weight? | I used to have a pretty slim body last year and hit the gym several times a week that time. I had plenty of free time to do that and I was really motivated to have a healthy lifestyle. 

After the summer of 2018, I had to move out to another city and live alone. I couldn’t make any friends there, I felt extremely alone on some days and, apart from that, I hated what I was studying at college. I didn’t know how to handle these endless moments of loneliness (combined with a and I just started to eat a lot as a coping mechanism: I ate 4-5 times a day, fast-food every week and an exaggerated amount of sweets and chocolate daily. 

There’s no wonder I’ve gained around 10 kilos in less than 6 months. I feel very guilty for this and I wish I had motivation and energy for going to the gym, but I feel so tired every day. I barely do my chores or my homework when I have a good day, but during the other ones I simply stay in bed and wasting my time. 

Of course, my family noticed I’m fat and I have a lot of acne on my face due to unhealthy food. Having to accept rude and blunt comments is what bothers me the most. My sister’s husband keep asking me how many kilos I have (“70, 75 or more?”),  why I don’t go to the gym, why I eat so much and many other “why”s and “what”s. It’s clear he asks these in an arrogant manner, as he’s a bodybuilder and have a very clean diet.  I easily sense when someone just wants to make me feel bad.

1,"AITA: Is it rude to fart? | Weirdly I was never given specific etiquette advice about this until my wife and I got into a conversation about it.  I asked her why women never seem to fart, and instead of answering that it is because they are embarrassed, she said it was very rude to do so.  Basically she says it's rude to fart anywhere anyone can smell it.

I don't know if it's a guy thing, but no one ever *specifically* told me that farting in public is considered rude.  So I've always figured, if you have to fart, you fart.  Trains, meetings, elevators, whatever.

The wife is gobsmacked that this is even a conversation - curious if there's a definitive consensus on this.

0,"AiTA for not trusting a delivery driver? | Today I ordered food off of an app- it's a third party delivery service that picks up the food and delivers your order. Once you pay online, you're given a code that you give to the delivery driver once he gives you your food (I assume that's how the drivers get paid). The app generates a time that you can expect to get your food by, and the drivers are expected to complete the delivery by then, so if you don't get your order by the promised time you often get a percentage of your order cost refunded. Drivers are not limited in how many orders they can pick up simultaneously (they use their discretion to pick up the tickets they want), but if they take too many at once, they will exceed the time limit and most likely suffer a penalty.

&#x200B;

I had ordered one tea and 2 pastries, for which I only received one. I called the shop and the manager was very apologetic, offering to using the service to send me out the missing pastry ASAP. I had assumed they would just refund me through the app, but that solution was fine too. The shop paid the delivery fee, and I was given the code to give to the driver when my order arrived. About twenty minutes later, the driver called me to ask for the code, stating he was on his way. I thanked him for letting me know he was coming and hung up, to which he called back two minutes later asking for the code again. I replied that I would have it for him the minute he arrived. After another two minutes, he called back again telling me he was nearby and he was running out of time, could he have the code? I told him he would get the code when I got my food. This time I was a bit annoyed, as he knows the rules as a driver and the only way I can guarantee that my food will be delivered is to hold onto the code until my food is here. The guy snapped at me: do you not understand the code is about to expire?! And I retorted back: Well, you better hurry then, right? as nicely as possible before hanging up. I didn't want to argue any longer, but I wasn't about to risk not getting my item by giving up the code. My friend told me that I was being selfish and unkind since the guy might not get paid for the delivery. I argued that since he voluntarily picked up the ticket, he shouldn't have taken ones he couldn't deliver on time. He said something to the effect of, ""thank goodness the world isn't full of unkind bitches like you"".

&#x200B;

So, AItA? Should I have just given him the code and trusted he would still bring me my food?

&#x200B;

The end of the story is, after I refused to tell him the code, I never heard from him again nor did I see my pastry. The shop manager saw the order wasn't marked as delivered and called to ask what happened, to which I told her the details. She tried to call the delivery guy then, but he had turned off his phone, so she apologized profusely, refunded me through the app, and reported him to the delivery service management. The manager said that he will either be severely disciplined or fired over this.",False,False
0,"WIBTA for not having another kid? | Repost bc I exceeded character limits. 

I have a 3 year old. His biological father is not in the picture and basically never has been. I've always been content with that and started looking to date again when he was around 9 months old. I wasn't expecting to hit the jackpot but I did. My husband is the best man I've ever known and we are the absolute best of friends. He took my son in as his own and loves him to death. I'm so so grateful for him every day and my son adores him. It's just an overall awesome situation I never thought would happen. 

Okay. So my husband has always gone back and forth about wanting to have a child of his own. I've gone back and forth about it too since I had my son and ultimately I really, sincerely do not want to have another one. I have a lot of varying reasons for this.

 My husband does want one of his own. Mostly for the ""novelty"" of having a child with someone you love, passing on genes etc. A child who is biologically his that he helped create. I totally understand why he would want that and I empathize completely with how he feels. Although other times he will say it sounds nice, but he could really live without it and it's not the upmost important thing to him, he sees more benefits to NOT having another one etc. I think he feels like that sincerely at times but deep down he still wants one of his own. 

Today it came up again after a long period of time of not discussing it at all. We were talking about some bad shit happening in the world and I said that it's another reason I feel I don't want another child. From there it spiraled. My husband said that I'm denying him the opportunity to have one of his own. He said that I don't want another one because I'm lazy and simply don't want to put in the effort to raise another child. It got nasty. By the end of it after we both kind of cooled down the tone was basically ""if it happens it happens, if it doesn't it's whatever"" but now I feel this massive weight of pressure and guilt that I'm not sure how to get past. 

I get where he's coming from. I truly do. And I know theres a big possibility that down the road he will end up resenting me if I don't decide to have another child. But I absolutely cannot force myself to want it. I can't make myself have a kid out of obligation. There is no part of me that wants another kid. Honestly, I didn't ever want to have kids in the first place but shit happens I guess. I love being a mom, I love my son to death. I know there is a possibility one day I'll change my mind, and I accept that, but I don't want my husband to bank on that happening.

0,"AITA for ""stealing"" money from my parents? | I know I sound like a asshole but hear me out.

I'm 16M BTW. 


So in my religion people celebrate eid on which elders give kids money to buy whatever they want. Similarly I also got eidi (eid money) to get whatever I want. So I collected eidi from every relatives and thanked them kindly and stored it. Its about 500$ usd.

So in my country in that much money you can easily get a good PC for high end games and basic editing or animation stuff. So I told my parents I am storing my money in my cupboard (I told them exactly where and no one else) and what I will do with it.

Then we went into hard times financially but not that hard that we would need to leave home or won't have food. Like one of those times that if you budget you could easily survive with all the bills paid but my parents like to get takeaway or dineout often which is extremely expensive in my country. (like really expensive).

So my parents asked me for some of my money and I asked what got and they said for usual bills. So I initially was willing to give them money but when I asked for details they became dismissive and I decided to not allow them to take my money.

So the time comes for me to go buy a PC. I open my cupboard and count my money. There is a 100$ missing. I immediately go to my parents and ask them who took it because only they have the key to my cupboard except me. At first they hesitate but then say things were financially hard so they took my money.

I asked them again for details but they ignored me and pretended I wasn't even talking. My mom said she will return me my money in 2 weeks. I was OK with that. 6 weeks go by and my dad just got off the phone with a local shop that sells mobiles.

Well I asked him why would he need to talk to a mobile phone guy considering he just got a phone upgrade. He then tells me he is getting my mom a new mobile. Initially I was happy but then I remembered that my mom said she would give me my money so I ask him about it.

He then pretended I didn't exist which made me mad and I went to my mom and asked her about my money. She said they don't have any money they are still struggling financially. I tell her about how my dad   is going to buy a new phone which costs around 100$.

She immediately goes to the kitchen to make food and when I ask her again she pretends I don't ask and like I am invisible.

So later I see dad put the 100$ in a cupboard. I warn my dad that I will take that money if he doesn't atleast tell me he wi return my money.

He again pretends I don't exist and puts the money.
That same night I went and took the money and hid all of my money in a secret drawer i built myself that no one knows about.

The next day he wakes up and sees the money is not there and I tell him I took it which makes him mad and he tells my mom which makes her mad too.

1,"AITA for taking a mans cart at the store that had items in it after he sniped it from me? | I was at a grocery store over the weekend that had massive sales. It’s a moderate size grocery store that I believe is a regional chain. There were no spaces in the parking lot and carts were very far and few between. 

As I was walking into the store, there was a lone cart that someone just left. I sped up to it, and rested my hand on the handle. I always like to clean it with a disinfecting wipe that the store has a dispenser of, so I turned my back and walked about 5 feet from my cart to get a wipe. When I turn around, a man in his 50s sniped my cart. As a note, I am a man in my 30s. 

I saw it happen and said excuse me sir that was my cart. He said “there was no one here when I got here so it’s mine actually” and shrugged and walked away. I was extremely annoyed because there was no carts. I also anticipated a large order so I needed a cart and a basket would not be sufficient 

I decided to follow the man around the store. He began to put items in the cart. When he got to an aisle, he turned his back, walked about 20 feet away to look at something. I saw this as an opportunity.. he had maybe 5 items in the cart, all small food items. I took the cart and began to walk backwards. He turned around and began screaming at me. I stared at him and continued walking backwards. Then, I gently took his items out and put them on the shelf. He began to yell and said it was his cart. I responded, just as he had to me, that “there was no one here when I got here actually, it is actually mine now”. 

He lost it. I ignored him and began shopping. I calmly got my meats and he was berating me. A few customers noticed and the manager came out. He took both our statements and ended up getting a cart that he found in the parking lot and brought it to the man.

 I had mentioned to my neighbour across the street that I was going to buy a sofa bed for our office to use for overnight guests. She offered us a small one she had in her basement that she never used. It was old but in good shape but the mattress had to be replaced. Said great, thanks, and I bought a new mattress for it (she knew I was putting money into it).

So after a year and a half or so I sold the couch and I had also listed a bunch of other stuff on FB because we were changing up the house and moving the guest room and getting a queen bed for it. The couch wasn’t worth anything, there are tons of free couches like it listed on kijiji, FB etc but I wanted to get back what I could from the mattress purchase (it was a $200 mattress and had been slept on once). I ended up selling it for $75.

Neighbour saw my FB ads and she comments on one of the pics saying that if I’m getting rid of the sofa bed she wants it back.

I didn’t respond and then that night she sends me a FB message, “As per my comment, blah blah want the sofa bed back if you are getting rid of it”.

I responded that i no longer needed it so I sold it to recoup some of the cost of the new mattress.

This event had been planned since last weekend. So I have this friend called Eileen (21F) who’s the sweetest thing, but she’s the prettiest friend I have and really steals the spotlight all the time.

I thought we would have that girly connection and she would understand without asking me why. However, she called me to ask me why. I told her that she’s always inadvertently getting all the attention because she’s so much more beautiful than me and every one of our friends and gets even more attention when she’s wearing something low cut, so I thought it would be nice if she could dial it back a little so I could be the star for one night.

1,"AITA for Asking My Wife to Eat Her Breakfast a Certain Way | Healthy eating is super important to me. I have small children at home, and a large part of my mental space is occupied by thinking about how I can ensure that my family has a generally healthy diet. I'm not completely obsessed. The kids eat cake and ice cream at parties. We take them out to ice cream now and then. I give them a few pieces of chocolate in their lunches. We do a special breakfast once a week where the kids can vote on pancakes, waffles, crepes, etc. But I see healthy eating as one of the most important values that I can instill in my family.

The kids usually choose crepes for their special breakfast. These are the richest and least healthy option. I make pancakes and waffles with wheat and oat flour, but crepes I do by our traditional family recipe--butter, sugar, white flour… It's a special treat, and I want them to enjoy it. The only filling we use is pure maple syrup, and the one thing I ask is that we don't use a ton of it. Crepe batter is super rich, maple syrup has lots of sugar, and it is very expensive. I tell them a little goes a long way. Plus, it's healthier to use just a little!

We roll our crepes like a burrito, and just like putting ingredients in a burrito, I ask everyone to apply a single line of syrup down the center along the roll rather than pouring haphazardly all over the surface. Not only does it help us use less, but it’s reasonable given the burrito roll method. (When you cut it into small sections, each bite will have the same amount of syrup in the center.) The kids get the rationale, and I make sure that I lead by example.

My wife can't get behind the single line of syrup thing though. She likes sweet things and uses lots of syrup on her crepes. She pours in a spiral over the whole surface, using about 3x what anyone else does. For a long time, when she helped the kids fill their crepes, she refused to pour a single line, instead slathering syrup all over. I think it was a sort of protest, as she sees me as being too nitpicky. After a lot of complaining on my part, she did change, but it was a real headache.

I want her to jump on board with the syrup thing so that we can send a consistent message to the kids. I have suggested this to her on various occasions and explained my reasoning carefully. I don't think it's unreasonable or irrational to think that we should have a family policy around this, and I have trouble understanding why this should represent a significant problem for her.

She thinks I'm being unreasonable and irrational in asking this of her--that it's purely a matter of preference and that I shouldn't be pressuring her in any direction. I want us to be a team on this.

0,"AITA For kicking out my younger sister | This happened 3 days ago

So I (19m) live with my SO at a 3 bedroom house. I pay for everything and I make enough to afford a few luxuries. My dad called and asked if he and my mom with my 2 sisters could stay at my place since he was laid off. 

I agreed and since then I’ve laid down house rules. Keep the house clean (dishes rooms and overall keep a good appearance) and my older sisters boyfriend can’t come over under any circumstances. 

The problem is my older sister (16) she’s so rude to my SO and doesn’t help out at all. So tonight I got everyone dinner and whatknot and told my sister to do the dishes. She scoffs and said why can’t your SO do the dishes. I replied that I told her to do it and SO does her fair share around the house. 

Anyway I come back after half and hour and the dishes aren’t done and she’s instead playin on her phone. I shut off her connection to the WiFi and tell her she can’t use it for a week and to do the dishes. 

She shouts at me you aren’t my dad. I completely lost it with her that she doesn’t pay bills and I’m the only reason why she’s staying afloat. My dad is like chill out so I cool it and demand an apology to me and my SO for her behavior. 

So we all go to bed and at like 4 in the morning I hear footsteps and the back door open. I thought an intruder broke in so I grab my fire arm to check it out. It’s my sisters bf. 

I blow up on how her bf could’ve been shot and she tells me that I’m a psycho so I tell her to leave until she gets some common sense.

0,"AITA for choosing to rent an affordable house instead of letting my friend rent it? | I am moving out of my apartment and renting a small house. For the past 2 months, I have been searching for rentals, talking to realtors, touring places and adjusting my deal-breakers until finally, I have found the perfect place that is very affordable for the area but still gives me the space I want and the location that I want.  I asked my friend to come with me to tour the place and that led to a heated discussion.

She is married, living with her husband, and they qualified for subsidized housing. However, when it came time for them to re-qualify, it turns out that they just barely make over the income limit due to both of them getting raises, but they are literally a couple hundred dollars over. Not enough to afford an actual apartment. 

When I showed her the pictures of the house that I was going to tour and the price, she asked if I could forgo the house and get an apartment since I make way more than their combined income (which is true) and since I didn't need as much space (I'm single). She said without the house that I am looking at, they will have to take out loans to afford an actual apartment. I said no because I have been putting in all this work to find the house, and while I do make more money than them on paper, in reality, I have other expenses that sop up that extra money (student loans, auto loan, savings goals etc).  We didn't fight but it was heated and she said that she didn't want to come tour anymore.

We got champagne and took pictures and then went back to the room and she dropped the ball on me— she didn’t want to actually marry me.

I was so horribly broken in that moment. I cried and asked why she would lead me on like this, and she got upset and said it was my fault for planning a public proposal without discussing engagement with her first. She said we were moving too quickly and she wasn’t ready. I told her she should have told me so instead of getting my hopes up and shattering them later. She refused to listen or agree.

I got a message on Care.com of a mom asking if I was interested in hanging out with her son and helping him cope with his general anxiety, prepare for college, and have experience being social. I told her I was definitely interested and the mom and I arranged a time for her son and I to go out to get lunch. I drove over to the boy’s house to find out he was the same age as me (previously thinking he would be around 10/11 age). The boy definitely had a lot of anxiety and was a little awkward. I asked him what his mom told him about me and he said, “that I messaged his mom and I was looking to hangout with someone and do fun things because I am lonely.” After we awkwardly hung out for a couple of hours, the mom told me not to come meet her as she doesn’t want him to know that she and I are still in contact. She then PayPaled me $20/hour for hanging out with her son. She asked me if my friends and I were interested in all hanging out with him and getting paid. We all did this a few times and individually got paid the same hourly rate. After a few times, I found this to be saddening. As someone who struggles with anxiety, I would be destroyed if I ever found out that my only friends were getting paid to hangout with me by my mom. But would definitely want to know this to grow and not feel so blinded and sheltered. 

I ended up telling the boy what his mom was doing after many times suggesting to his mom that maybe she could tell him that I am peer mentor but not his friend, because this would probably be embarrassing and hurtful information for him to find out one day along the line. I also suggested many support groups for people struggling with the same kind of issues. I think lying to him about having friends is possibly a patch in the present, but definitely going to be a bigger issue in the long run.

I also have a fairly severe psychotic disorder myself. Just want to make it clear that I'm not just some random who has done a google search. 

So the issue. A friend of mine started seeing a woman about a year ago, and she's become controlling to the point of it seemingly emotionally abusive. She goes through his phone, has access to his social media accounts so she can monitor who he's interacting with and gets incredibly angry if he does anything without her. She claims that she has Borderline Personality Disorder and can't help it. I don't believe her. My first red flag was when she claimed to be on a medication that is typically not used to treat BPD as it's pretty ineffective at it. She's also bad at keeping track of which symptoms she does and doesn't have. She'll literally claim that she suffers horribly from one symptom and then two days later talk openly about how lucky she is to have never dealt with it. She's also confused BPD with NPD in the past.

I was talking about this with another friend and said I think she's certainly unstable on some level, but I think she's lying about BPD because she thinks it excuses her shitty behaviours. My friend told me that I was being really cruel and that other people's experiences aren't mine to dictate. I fully agree, I just don't think this chick has what she says.

1,"WIBTA if I kick my adult ”stepdaughter” out of my house? | New here so if I haven’t understood one of the rules please let me know!

I have a tricky situation I’m going through as of late.  I’m in a long term relationship.  We aren’t technically married, but we live as we are.  After a messy divorce she was never interested in being married again.  We’ve been dating for 8 years now.  I told her that the engagement is the best part so I proposed with both of us understanding that we would never actually get married.  She has an adult daughter who lives with us.  She’s 19. 

My “stepdaughter” and I have never had a good relationship despite my best efforts.  I really gave it everything I could to improve it over the years, but at best she was indifferent to me.  I gave up trying after buying her a car for her 16th birthday and she thanked her mother and didn’t acknowledge me at all even after her mother told her that I alone bought it for her.  

After that I’ve been just waiting her out for the most part.  I’m still kind when I’m around her, but if this is the relationship with me she wants then so be it.  I always assumed that when she turned 18 she would go off to school somewhere.  I was unfortunately wrong.  She instead started working at a salon in town.  She had taken cosmetology in BOCES in high school.  

I thought once she had been working for a bit and had saved enough she would then move out.  Wrong again.  I’ve asked her mother to see what her plans are for the future and if she plans on moving out on her own soon and my wife told me that she just wants to save as much as she can and keep living here.   My fiancé loves having her here, but I’ve been waiting so long to have the house be just my fiancé and I.   

I really feel like I’ve put my time in supporting her daughter and now especially with her having more than enough to move out on her own it’s time to push her out of the nest.  I’m not too concerned with her reaction.   To be blunt I don’t really care how she takes it.

0,"AITA for asking a teacher to make changes to his recommendation letter? | TL;DRs after every block.

Hi, 17F, applying for college/scholarships specifically in computer science. There is one computer science teacher (40s-50sM) at my high school, and I've taken three of his classes across two years -- all As, the only 5 on the AP comp sci test from our school last year. I've also participated in/later held leadership positions in the coding and robotics teams he runs after school. Both of these teams have placed in competitions each year I've participated, after consistently taking last place in previous years. I also won two of the coding competitions individually and was the sole coder for robotics when we took first my junior year (last year).

TL;DR All of that to say, I think I'm competent in comp sci, and this teacher is in a unique position to vouch for that.

I asked him to please write me a letter of recommendation, and he said he was happy to. He did that for many members of our teams who were planning to go into computer science. I didn't opt out of being allowed to read recommendation letters before I attach them, and his is not really what I was looking for. In two pages, he references my ""beautiful smile"", boys in the class being ""no-doubt distracted by her beauty"" (??), me being an animal lover and me having a nice singing voice. He barely brushes on anything related to computer science or even my competence in general (I had the highest PSAT/SAT scores in our year too, which he knows), and includes a lot of irrelevant information. He references my appearance four separate times, and he only mentions the coding team as part of a story about me being happy to pet a dog that they brought after the competition -- making no mention of me winning the individual portion of the competition itself. It's not a mean letter at all, but I still think it hurts my chances if anything because it makes it seem like someone who's known me in a comp sci setting for years can't really speak to any abilities -- or even like I didn't earn my grades in his classes, which I know I did. In my mom's words, it makes me ""look like a bimbo"".

TL;DR: Letter did not reference any computer science competency. Includes a lot of frivolous information, unintentionally makes me look ditzy.

Anyway, he asked if the letter had made it to the system so I told him yes, and thank you, but that there were a few changes I'd like if that was alright. I explained what they were, and he got pretty offended and said he was doing me a favor, etc. I understand he didn't have to write me a letter at all, and I still appreciate the effort. I offered to rewrite it myself for him to submit so he doesn't have to put more time into it, but he declined. Am I the A for taking issue with a favor if the favor isn't actually helpful?

TL;DR: Teacher got offended I asked for changes to his letter. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA For Not Driving 4 Hours To Clean A Fish Tank? | Apologies for mobile post.

Basically a year ago I did a study abroad program. I had a couple of pet fish I had to leave behind. When I came home I reclaimed my pets, but my younger sister had grown attached to one so she asked to keep it. I said yes, as long as my parents helped with taking care of it. They agreed. For the record it is a pretty low level fish in terms of care; a betta that is in a 5 gallon tank with a filter.

I live two hours away for school. Routinely my mother will text me I need to come home to clean the aquarium. I remind her I offered to take him back with me, and they wanted him so it is not my responsibility. Regardless she will say things like ‘if you don’t come clean it the fish is just going to die’. Among expletives calling me lazy/ungrateful for not just doing it for them.

In the past I have come and done it just to ensure the fish’s health. Most of the time the tank isn’t even dirty; the 9 year old leaves the light on so algae grows on the glass and they take that to mean it’s ‘dirty’. 
Given current circumstances I’m even less keen on the 4 hour drive.

She has this gold locket that she's had since she was like 9. It's from this disney series and it's in the shape of a heart with a keyhole sort of shape. It's a nice locket, and it's pretty unique too. But to me, it's just a necklace. My girlfriend hasn't been wearing it for awhile now because she said she needed to get gold chain for it. I told her she already has a chain. But she apparently can't wear it because it's made of silver, and she's ""allergic"" to silver. I don't know how anyone can be allergic to silver, since it's in a lot of things. So she's been planning on getting a gold chain, which in my opinion, is a waste of money. The locket itself is made of actual gold, so why waste more on it.

So she hasn't been wearing it. And my sister visited us. I've been worried about her, to show I still care for her health and such, I gave her my girlfriend's locket as a gift. My sister loved it, and she's not allergic to silver and thought it was cute.

When my girlfriend came home, she ended up finding out I gave away her lock. She demanded I go retrieve her locket. I said no, and she decided to go get the locket back from my sister. My sister called me crying, telling me my girlfriend stole the locket from her. I told my girlfriend she should give the necklace back. My girlfriend told me to f right off and said the necklace was special. I told her it's just a necklace, she can buy a new one if she wants. She said it's the only one like this. And that this necklace holds a lot of meaning to her. I told her that makes no sense, since it's just from a disney game with mickey mouse and other characters. She blew up on me and called me an f-ing thief. I told her we're a couple, her stuff is my stuff also. She threatened to sell my stuff if I ever touched her necklace or anything ever again. I told her she's over reacting, that the necklace is better suit for a child since it's so childish to get mad over a necklace.

I'll try to keep this short. 


I love my girlfriend and I love going on holiday with her. HOWEVER I've recently been asked by a friend if I want to go travelling with them for a few months. My girlfriend isn't happy because in the past she has suggested this and I haven't been keen.

The reason I'm not keen to travel with my SO is because I see travelling as more dangerous than a normal holiday, the idea is to go outside of your comfort zone and expand your experiences and I feel like if I was with my GF then I would be in a constant state of worry. I don't care for my own safety anywhere near as much as I care about hers and if anything happened to her while travelling I know I would never forgive myself, even if it wasn't directly my fault or I couldn't have prevented it.

I'm usually the one who remains calm and composed in unusual or frightening situations and TBH I like that role (it makes me feel valued) but while travelling around areas that I feel I would already be slightly anxious I think it might ruin it if I had to feel anxious for both me and her.

I was really happy and enjoyed that gift and i've decided to make something special for her. I had 3 months until her birthday. I've started brainstorming all kind of ideas and in the end came to the conclusion: it's not about gift as a material thing, but its about emotions (cpt. obvious).  The thing is that i love all kind of riddles, puzzles, quests, etc and i was trying to make my girlfriend join the dark side. After some time she also have started to enjoy theses kind of activities, especially break rooms. So my idea for her birthday present was to make her cool city quest. In my town, there are a few companies that  organize city quest and they have only a few set quest scenarios. So i've decided to make my own super cool romantic quest. First of all i've searched for an app to make things easier, but i could not find one, so i made my own app for quest creation(putting markers on the map with description to guide my girlfriend through quest). Then i wrote a scenario. In the end quest included places of our first date, first kiss, etc. also i've added a few historical city places, it had to be fun and educational.

Three days ago the day has come. It was her birthday. I've showed her my quest-app and the quest had began. To keep thing short it was really fun, romantic and entertaining; we had a great time.

He's one of those pastors who likes to travel to small town churches and guest-speak. A lot of the comments were anonymous but a few of them had accounts with photos. One of them, we'll call her ""Betty"" had commented praising the pastor for his post, mentioned that they had met when he preached at her church and she felt like they had a connection and she wanted to speak to him and reconnect. Betty's profile picture and the general tone of her comment gave me the idea that she might be elderly. Based on her photo, she seemed like she was at least 70/75. In her comment she included her hometown, her church, her first and last name, and her cellphone number.

I've seen so many people post their number online where anyone can see it, especially Facebook.

Anyway, I noticed a lot of trolls in the comments on the pastor's page saying some pretty awful things, commenting mean things to other commenters and I got a little worried that one of them might send ""Betty"" some nasty texts. I've been doxxed before and had some truly terrible things sent to my phone that resulted in me having to get a new number.

While walking to my car, a car stopped next to me and I was confronted by a young black man around my age, I knew he must work for my company because he was wearing a badge, and he accused me of profiling him and refusing to ride the elevator with him. I explained this is a misunderstanding because I left my phone at my desk, he said he found that hard to believe and said I owed him an apology.

I received a summons to HR on my calendar this coming Monday to discuss the situation, I asked my boss what was going on and he explained that the gentleman from the parking garage complained that he felt racially targeted by me since I 'refused' to ride the elevator with him. Multiple people I have spoken to have told me to just apologize and let the whole thing blow over. I don't feel like I owe him an apology, and quite frankly with the frequency in which women are attacked by strangers, I don't think I would have been at fault for refusing to ride the elevator in the first place. 

I genuinely feel blameless in this situation but everyone is telling me to apologize including my boss who can corroborate that I didn't make up the story about my phone at my desk. I have also been told that I should have communicated why I wasn't getting on the elevator, I don't see how that would have helped because he could have thought my explanation about my phone was a lie then instead of when he confronted me later.

1,"WIBTA for firing employee over frequent apologies? | This young girl has been working for me for about 6 months. She’s good at her job and very lovely, but she apologizes constantly and it’s driving me crazy. Every little thing that happens, whether it has anything to do with her or not, pulls an apology out of her. She could be walking by and almost bump into me, “oh, sorry!” The pen I go to use is out of ink, “sorry about that! Let me find you a new one!” It just makes me feel like a jerk that she needs to tiptoe around.

I pulled her aside and told her in a friendly way that rarely, if ever, does she do anything that requires apology. She...apologized, and then, apologized for apologizing again. Then, looking distraught, took a 5 minute break outside. This has caused a new issue, because now when she will start to unnecessarily apologize, she’ll catch herself and say she’s working on it. It’s almost like she’s short-circuiting. I can’t be in a work environment where I’m always feeling like a bad guy, and I just don’t think she can break this habit. WIBTA if I let her go? I would give her a good recommendation.

0,"AITA for being suspicious and lightly irritated that my MIL is manipulating me/us? | My husband's family has a standing yearly tradition of a family camping trip. It's held on the same weekend every year, and MIL expects all of her kids to come (it's basically 2nd Christmas at this point). It has only changed weekends a couple of times in the last 2 decades, causing chaos, sooo they don't change it idly. Also of important note, MIL organises and purchases everything, then divides the cost by person and each family reimburses her for their portion. No one has a problem doing this, including us. 

I love this trip. I look forward to it every year, because it's often the only vacation hubby and I get. This year however, the camping trip weekend falls 6wks after my due date. 

I made an idle comment to MIL a couple weeks before Christmas about us planning on coming, and massively looking forward to it, while simultaneously hoping that I'll feel up to us coming...basically a hope and plan for the best but mentally prepare for the worst type conversation.

She became visibly irate, and asked WHY I thought we might not come.

....b-because I will have very recently pushed a squashed watermelon out of my baby purse (or if I'm unlucky had my abdomen carved open, rifled through, then slapped back together like a Thanksgiving turkey) and I physically might be in extreme discomfort or pain, rendering the idea of being in an unpredictable, ""rustic"" environment with shared (and probably less-than-sanitary) facilities entirely unappealing?

She made a face and didn't say anything else about it, but a couple weeks later at Christmas, hubby and I's Christmas gift was a homemade gift certificate explaining that our family's camping expenses were prepaid in full. 

I mentioned to hubby that I was SUPER APPRECIATIVE of this gesture, but that I simultaneously feel that she's manipulating me into a position of not being able to say ""no"" to coming on the camping trip, which I dislike. He was irritated with me for seeing ulterior motives in his mom's generosity.

TL;DR - I tell MIL we *might* not be coming on a traditional yearly camping trip due to my having given birth just weeks prior, she responds by paying for our portion of expenses...I feel she's manipulating me/us into coming, hubby feels I'm being ungrateful and petty. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for smoking weed inside | I (24M) rent a small apartement with a close friend(24M). My friend, other friends and me like to smoke weed in the weekends and some times at night on weekdays. 

Our room can be accesed from the hallway through our kitchen, which we share with the neighbour (M+-24). The neighbour moved in about 6 moths ago and recently started complaining that he doesn't want us smoking weed inside anymore because he doesn't like the smell. He later explainded that he used to smoke a lot of weed when he was younger and doesn't want to be reminded of it any more. He said he sometimes gets a little paranoid when he smells it. 

&#x200B;

We live in a place were we can legally buy and smoke weed and the homeowner knows we smoke weed inside and is Ok with it.

Yesterday the neighbour came barging in to our room saying he was fed up with the weed smell in the kitchen. 

We told him we can make sure all the doors are shut / we can put up some candles / we can turn on the extractor hood in the kitchen but we want to be able to smoke weed inside our own place. 

He said it was our responsibility to make sure we are no burden to him.

have him on Snapchat, and up until last night I had snap maps enabled. Basically he sent me a Snapchat of some lollies from a service station and I said I liked lollies. I didn’t really think anything of this until he sent me a picture of my car with a bag of lollies on it. I wasn’t positive it was mine because I couldn’t see the rego plate. I park in the street, and when I went out to check, I heard a voice in the dark say “hello” and there he was.

This was creepy for a number of reasons. The first being he literally stalked me to find out where I lived and then showed up with no warning. Another is that I have specifically told him that I don’t want to meet up with him outside of work because my partner isn’t comfortable with that. And the main reason it is bothering me so much is that the week before this happened we had literally had a conversation about this topic, and how weird I found it that people would try to find people’s houses like that. 

He said to me “well your location is shared with me on Snapchat” and I said “that’s not an invitation” 
Later on that night I messaged him saying that it’s best if we don’t communicate outside of work anymore, and then removed him from my social media.

1,"AITA for continuing to message my ex even though she doesn't reply? | So,my ex and I had what I thought to be an amazing relationship. We technically lived together in our college dorm, and we spent a lot of time together. We were both really happy with each other, and would constantly tell each other what we loved about the other and whatnot. She was a huge part of my life, but was having a hard time with the college environment and eventually left. I also had to take online classes at home for a semester, so we were really far apart.

I thought that we'd be able to do a long distance relationship, and I thought it worked for a while. There weren't really any problems. But overtime we'd talk less and less. There were times where she's disappear for a week without any word, then suddenly come back. She told me she ignored all my messages because she wanted to be alone for a bit. That's perfectly fine, but I'd at least like to know that,so that I don't worry that she'd disappeared for a week. This happened a couple times, then this past Christmas she said I should try to look for another girlfriend.

To this day, I still don't really understand what happened. We had a great time, then suddenly it's all over. I haven't heard anything from her in a few months, she won't reply to me at all. I message her maybe once a week at most. Maybe only just a few times a month. I'd just like to know if I did something wrong, because if I did I'd like to fix it for next time. I also want to know how she's doing, because I know she's going through things, and I just want to make sure she's ok. I've heard absolutely nothing, and I feel bad for bothering her, but I just want to get some answers. So am I doing the wrong thing here? Should I just leave her alone?",False,False
0,"AITA for getting overly exited about my exam results? |  Hi! Some context:

I am in 8th grade. Prior to the start of distance learning, I was already taking 2 classes online, Physical Science Honors (9th grade class), and Geometry Honors (10th grade class). I was also taking Algebra 1 Honors at the same time, that is why I was allowed to take geometry.

Fast forward to 4/21/2020, and I had just taken my final exams for Geometry and Science, and had received the scores. Science was a 1 part test on which I got a 98%. Geometry was a 2 part test, on which I got a 89% and a 100%. For context, average scores for Science were in the 75-80 range. Average scores for geometry were in the 65-75 range. I, upon seeing my scores, was overjoyed. I told my grandmother, my father, and my mother. My grandfathers are deceased. My other grandmother was asleep. I was bouncing around the house with a stupid grin on my face. My mother then told me to shut up. She said that the scores I got were expected, and the 89% was disappointing. She then told me that even though I had these scores, she doubted that I truly knew the subjects. I was devastated. She told me that if I kept being excited about these scores, I was never going to get any better. She said that I was going to flunk out of the high school I was accepted into because I could not strive to be any better. Now that comment really stung. I had worked insanely hard this entire school year to make it into the school, and managed to top the entrance exam, yet my mother and father still said I was going to fail even harder in a better school.

Here is where I think I may be TA. I called my mother a cruel, heartless, and cold person, and went to my room and stayed there all day, only coming out for food.

0,"WIBTA for not helping my brother make cupcakes? | I (24f) am living with my dad (50s), my brother (21), and my kids (6m and 4f). I've recently moved back in pending some legal stuff.

My kids love Frozen. Recently I got a food shop delivered to the house, and as a treat I bought them Frozen 2 and a Frozen cupcake kit. When it arrived they wanted to make cupcakes while watching the movie.

When I organised the shop I told my dad and brother that I'd be baking when it arrived, so was there anything they wanted. My brother asked for cupcakes, and I said we were planning on making cupcakes so that worked out perfectly. Dad wanted turnovers, so I gave my kids the icing, decorations, and a stack of cupcakes while I made the turnovers, and as predicted only half the icing made it onto the cakes and visually they leave a lot to be desired, but the kids were very proud of their decorating skills and they had fun, which was the goal.

Between the baking, cleaning up, and me making dinner, me and my kids have been in the kitchen all day and no one has come in, probably because of them watching Frozen 1 and 2 on a loop.

After dinner I gave cupcakes to my kids, gave dad his turnover, then went to my brother's room and gave him a cupcake. As I'm leaving I hear his girlfriend (they were facetiming) going ""awww"". I then hear my brother go ""what the fuck is this?""

I turn, he's holding up the cupcake, I tell him it's a cupcake. He tells me not to get smart, asks why it looks like that. I tell him it's from a kit, I baked it, the kids decorated. He tells me that when he asked for cupcakes he meant ""normal"" cupcakes. He asked me to make normal ones tomorrow (from scratch, not a box, with better decoration) and I said ""no, we've got cupcakes, when we've finished them I'll make more"", then left.

Later, after the kids and I have gone to bed, my brother comes into my room. I'm not fully asleep but nearly and he asks me if I can come with him to the kitchen and help him bake cupcakes, as he doesn't know the measurements or temperature and wants my help icing later. I tell him I already said I'd bake some but he says he wants them now. I tell him to google it.

It's been an hour. I can hear him swearing from here. It sounds like he's burned himself more than once and I can smell burning cake. Dad (who's usually in the room next to the kitchen at this time) texted me. He said my brother has been in the kitchen for the last hour and keeps fucking up, and this would be over with sooner if I could come help. Dad doesn't know I've seen/read this text, I'm tired, and I think this whole thing is stupid.

1,"AITA for not providing tampons for my daughter? | I use pads myself and ever since my daughter started menstruating, she also used pads. That is until last month she asked me if I'd buy her tampons to try. There's no harm in trying so I had a coworker give me a couple to see what she thought. She told me she prefers tampons and asked if I'd buy her some next time I get hygiene products myself.

My daughter is 16. She has a job and a car (with learner's permit); the nearest pharmacy is on our block, only a 5min walk or so. She has the money to buy it herself, and I told her as much. I don't mind sharing my pads with her because whatever, they're there, but if she wants something more special, it's on her and with her money.

This caused a ruckus and I don't know why. I get the most basic of basic pads, I don't need anything special, but she wants the more expensive alternative. Then that's on her, right? She told me it's ""not her fault she's a woman"" which boggles my brain because why is the onus on me to provide this for her?

0,"AITA for keeping my duffel bags on MY bed? | Sounds obvious, but my roommate keeps making remarks about it and I'm sensitive. I'm 23F if that makes a difference

I have a pretty small room, but my bed is pretty big - it's a queen size that takes up about half the room's space. I don't have a lot of stuff, but what I do have takes up the rest of the space in the room, so I don't have any other furniture except a dresser. I'm making plans to move out, so I've been packing the stuff I need to take with me in the car, in the duffel bags like clothes, my most important documents, photo albums, etc. Stuff I don't want to lose basically, very important to me so I don't want them elsewhere. I can't take them out of my room because my mom will throw my shit away. 

enter my roommate - he moved in a few months ago, and I told him I would stuff all my stuff in the closet to make room for his bed to put a bed in here, or a couch, or something for him to sleep on. He got too lazy (his words) and his old roommates threw his bed out because he left it there for ages and didn't bring it with him, so he's been sleeping in my bed (there's nothing I can do about this, I really REALLY am not comfortable with the arrangement at all but my mom's word is pretty much law and she told me to deal with it. I didn't even want a roommate but conceded) 

so, two people in a queen size bed. big enough for us, yeah. Now that I've started packing stuff though, my duffel bags need to go SOMEWHERE and they're too big to fit on the dresser (small dresser) and James' (not real name) stuff is on top of it anyway, and there is seriously no other furniture in the room to put them on, nor floor space after James added his stuff to the pile of stuff in here. So what I ended up doing was putting the large one at the head of the bed where my head goes, and the smaller one going lengthwise like a third body in the bed. they don't encroach past ""my"" half of the bed, I snuggle the one going lengthwise and have barely any room in the bed, only way it works is because I'm 5ft tall and fit there. 

My roommate keeps making comments about them, like ""when are you going to move out? I'm tired of sleeping with your duffel bags"" and ""if you didn't have so much shit we wouldn't have to sleep with duffel bags"". 

My take on it is, they're on my side and I gave him the chance to bring his bed in here. I offered to get rid of my bed so we could get two twin beds, but he said he likes the queen bed too much. I also want a barrier between us now because he accidentally starts snuggling me in the middle of the night sometimes and I hate it. (I'm not concerned past that though, he's very very gay). This is also my bed, I didn't ask him to move in with us and sleep in it. He even complains that they're there when I'm not sleeping in the bed, where there's MORE room??

I’ll address the family members by A & B.
I’ve basically been my family’s babysitter for six years & I NEVER get paid. Even if I ask to be paid my family says “you don’t get paid if you’re family.”
There have been countless times where A will drop their child off, say they will be gone for “only a couple of hours” & then not show up for three or more hours after said time.
B has done the same to me as well.
A & B only ever contact me to babysit.

0,"AITA for refusing to help my mom on this project? | Over the past three weeks my sister and I've been painting my parent's house. We started in the dining room then moved to the large entryway/living room area which requires us the work on scaffolding as the walls are so high. it's also a really awkward room with lots of ornate moulding. It's been a grueling few weeks and my mom gets really angry whenever we ask for a break. We've had 2 breaks in this time, and she still brings it up as us being lazy. 

I started this project being really upfront with her: I want to be able to fit in reasonable stopping points between projects. Aka I'm starting this project ONLY and once I'm done I want a break to focus on myself for a few days before moving on to the next project. I don't mind doing these projects but I want to spend time for myself too.

I said that because she likes to start projects then feverishly push people to finish them. Then she starts another project in the middle of the first project, then another, so the cycle of work never really ends, and god forbid you take a break with something unfinished. It's also a really chaotic method of working. I prefer doing things orderly as it keeps my own anxiety down.

Well, mom decided to start painting the kitchen (of course.) She claimed it was just her own project and that we don't have to help her. Thing is she can't do much because of her health, so she constantly asks us to stop what we're doing and help her. I told her over and over again that I'm not willing to start on the kitchen until I finish the front room. She seemed to relent with that at first.

This morning though mom came to me and said, ""hey can you ask your sister to help me tape around the cabinets?"" I was hesitant because my sister is even less enthusiastic about these projects than I am. 

Of course my sister refused because it's just too much work right now, but mom flew off the handle. She was calling us lazy and ungreatful. she was throwing insult after insult, and denying any of the work we've done so far.

*""You only do these things because I'll scream at you if you don't!""*

We had a similar fight before when my mom and I disagreed on the exact method for painting the dining room (paint one half of the room, than the other. Moving the furnature in between)

My oldest sibling who doesn't live here anymore was trying to give me advise about it and said, ""Treat this like an improv show. You always want to say *yes, but* but that's the same as saying *no*. Try saying *yes, and* instead.""

I just don't understand her logic though. While ""yes and"" can prevent a fight in the short term, it has been wrecking my mental health trying to keep up with mom's demands. if I say ""yes and when would be a good time to start?"" she'll say ""right now"". If I ask for a break I'm crewed out unless I literally have a panic attack. If I don't put my foot down about her parrallel projects, then I'll start having a mental break down.

0,"AITA for refusing to help the addict who saved my life when I was using? | I’m almost 28 and after some surgery I got addicted to prescription painkillers like oxy and Percocet. 

I eventually graduated to heroin and got clean when I was 26 but relapsed after only a couple months. At the time I was more or less homeless but me and this other guy “Jack” squatted together in this abandoned building for a little while. We looked out for each other and we always had Naloxone on us in case we needed it because the local needle exchange would give it out to known users in the city. 

I ended up overdosing after my relapse because I over estimated how much I could actually handle at that point and luckily Jack came back at the right moment and saved my life. 

After this, I have been fully clean for a little bit over a year now. I haven’t seen or heard from Jack for a really long time, I’ve moved into my own decent apartment, I have a decent job and I have always just assumed that he was dead by now. 

Well we live in a medium to smaller sized city so I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised that I would run into people I knew eventually. 

I was out going to my bank, which is in a sketchier part of the city, and I hear somebody call out my name. I turn around and it’s Jack. 

I can immediately tell that he’s super strung out and he goes, “Wow look at you. Guess you finally managed to get better.” 

I’m feeling nervous as fuck because I don’t trust strung out junkies because I was that strung out junkie not too long ago. 

He tells me that he has been trying to get sober for the past year but nothing has been working out. Then, as I expected, he asks me for help. He asks me if he can crash at my place or if I can help him out with some money to go to a rehab since he says that I now look like, “I can spare it.” 

I had nor do I have any desire to let an actively using heroin addict stay at my apartment. And I don’t want to give him money because I know for a fact that shit will not go to a rehab. 

I tell him that I don’t think I can do that for him but I wish him luck.

He says I’m a “fucking asshole” and that I’d be dead if it “wasn’t for him”. To be fair, he is right. I would’ve died without him. He then just spits at my feet and walks off. I left feeling pretty shook up. 

I thought at the time that I was making the right decision but I don’t know anymore. He did save my life and I could very well be in his position or dead instead of where I am right now. But I also don’t think I am ready to be around people like that at this point in my recovery. I’ve lost all of my family, who want nothing to do with me and my only friend left helped me get clean and I don’t want to drag him back into this world so I don’t have a lot of people to talk to about this besides my sponsor.

0,"AITA My bf(26) gave me(26) and ultimatum because I want this new puppy. | Situation: my brother got me a puppy (haven’t met yet) that is very similar to my old dog, let’s call him Rocky. My current BF, together for one year, said that he cannot be with me if I take this puppy.

Backstory: I have raised a dog with my ex for 4 years until we split up and we agreed to give him full custody because he was more dependent on Rocky and I understood that it will be more convenient and best overall that he takes Rocky. I fought for him but we talked it out like adults. I have asked to see and hangout with Rocky from time to time because Rocky is a big part of me and my ex and I’s relationship are platonic, nothing more than exes. He lets me see rocky and hangout with him here and there when I ask and I’m so grateful for it. My current bf came into the picture post break up and I was going through a tough time but I fell in love with a new man who would father my kids one day. 

He has a dog of 1 year and understood the situation and was okay with me seeing Rocky, kind of. He hates that I stay in contact with my ex because of Rocky but allows it, always telling my it’s a tough part on him but he understood the situation and tells me that this would be the opposite if he wasn’t a dog owner. Last month, my ex decided to put an end to the visits because he said it would be unfair to his new gf now. I was devastated that I was told I can no longer see Rocky. I can tell that my current bf is stoked at  the fact that it ended but not how it ended, and tells me why it had to be my ex to end it instead of me. He questioned if I even cared about him and how he was put in a place with no control and now feels better that I have no reason to contact me ex. My bf tells me this is a great chance for me to connect my his dog, but he sees that my heart will forever be with Rocky. I love his dog, but we all know it’s not the same.

The problem:
My brother got me a puppy for my birthday and didn’t consult with my bf prior and said to everyone that he’s probably fine with it and it’s ultimately my choice to decide. My brother is furious and wanted to cut contact with my brother because of that. My bf explained that this puppy will be in his life for the next 20 years too and I’m starting to get along with his dog and he hates how this puppy is being “forced down our throats”. I always tell him we are not ready for a dog until we move in, which is 1-2 years down the road, not now. The problem is I really want this dog and he gave me an ultimatum. He compromised and told me, we can go to the shelter and pick out a dog together and raise it together if I want a dog in my life, just don’t take this one given how everything went down.

1,"AITA for eating after an old lady told me to stop? | So every day on my way to the gym I eat a bag of pretzels. The bus ride is about 20 minutes. On all public transport, there is a sign that says “no eating, drinking, smoking, listening to music without headphones”. Nobody enforced this unless someone’s being annoying. People hold their coffees and eat snacks literally always. 

I’m literally quietly sitting there eating these pretzels out of my pocket and this old lady taps me on the shoulder asks “are you eating?”


Me: “Yes”


Her: “Well you should stop.” 


Me: “Is it bothering you?”


Her: “No, but those are the rules” 


So I turn around and continue. It’s a small bag of pretzels, I try to eat before I lift, and frankly I’m not making a mess, being loud or smelly, and there’s no nuts or something someone would be allergic too. It’s like the ultimate neutral food.

So this lady gets up for her stop and literally tells on me to the buss driver.

AND NOW IM MAD.

Am I being entitled for being mad by this?  Can’t tell if I’m being an entitled asshole or she was just being annoying for no reason. 
 
The bus driver looks at me, I’m literally done with the pretzels by now though. And the guy sitting in front of me turns around and goes “man, some people. If you’re hungry you eat!!” 

So I’m like....yeah ok I am probably not disrupting people? But rules are rules? 

tl;dr: AM I BEING ENTITLED ",False,False
0,"AITA for getting upset that the people I picked up from the airport didn’t get me a bagel? | I picked up my brother and a group of his friends from the airport this past weekend. I went out of my way an hour each way to do so. I was happy to do it but it was still a hassle.

I arrived at the crowded airport and went to the terminal. A couple minutes after they said they’d be there. They weren’t there. I waited a few minutes and then called my brother, who didn’t pick up. I called again just as a guy working for the airport waved at me to move on since I wasn’t allowed to park there. I warned my brother I’d have to leave, do a circle, and come back. He said “okay, do a few circles, we’ll be a minute.”

I circled several times, which sucked, until they got there and all piled in the car. I saw they had a big bag full of fresh bagels, so the time they were in the airport was them stopping for food. I was excited because I was hungry. They passed them all out and I didn’t get one. I said in sort of a joking way, “you didn’t get me one? Awww” and a girl laughed like that was ridiculous and said “no.”

I drove them back and mentioned the whole thing to my parents. My dad was mad at me for even mentioning it and being upset, saying that I didn’t have to get up at 3 am like they did and maybe they were stressed out and had more important things on their mind than getting “spoiled” me a bagel. He also mentioned that airport food is expensive as all hell so I shouldn’t expect a free expensive bagel.

AITA for being upset about this? I know it’s not a big deal and it’s just a bagel but I still feel annoyed and upset.",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I stopped seeing someone because they wont tell me the name of their religion? | Everything was chill, the conversation was easy and fun, I was excited for date two.

On date 2 they mentioned a ""spiritual community"" so I asked about it.  They gave me a whole spiel about camping, praying in nature, retreats that demand you be sober, that a lot of 12 step members are involved... I was expecting something pagan, wiccan, Celtic revival... whatever, I'm open minded.

But they didn't say the name of the group. So I asked if the religion had a name and they said, ""yes, but I dont want to disclose that right now.""

That's definitely means they're in a cult, right? That's creepy as hell? WIBTA if I ended it over that?",False,False
0,"AITA for cancelling on a group of very out of shape women that hired me to train/guide their hikes? | First up please know I am trying my best to be kind in my wording. I run a small operation where I guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. I have served all kinds of clients.

I got an inquiry for a group called ""Womens+ Adventures"" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.

The group wanted to work up to ""A 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

When I arrived for our first group hike, I learned ""Womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

The first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

After we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.

Please, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

I refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

0,"WIBTA if I fight the fact that my sister-in-law is moving in with us in her time of need? | I was informed today that my (29f) sister-in-law (35f) is moving in with us. Not asked. Informed that this is happening and I don’t have a say. WIBTA if I fight this?

This is all a bit messy. Where to start. SIL is divorcing her husband. Nothing major happened (not that I or anyone can truly is going on in someone else’s marriage). SIL and us are on good terms especially lately. However she is a self declared bitch. She can turn nasty in a second. I have always avoided her bad side until now. She has still sworn at me in a way no-one else ever has. SIL and BIL have 2 young kids.

My husband (32m), myself and our daughter (1f) are currently living in the 3 bedroom house my father-in-law built for SIL. SIL and BIL moved out of here last year July because she wanted to work from home as a dog groomer and security estate the house is built in would not allow that. 

(I did not want to move in here! I was worried it would get messy getting more involved with his family! Guess what... )

So we moved out of the house we OWN to RENT from FIL. At FIL and SIL’s request/encouragement. At the time I told my husband I was concerned that SIL would regret her choice and try claim the house back. He assured he would not allow that. The house is bigger and nicer so I caved.

FIL and my hubby run a business together. After 10 years of success the business took a major hit last year. Since the business is suffering hubby is only getting paid every second or third month. As a result hubby and I can’t always pay the rent (Which is pretty freaking high). My salary currently covers my car payments, daycare, groceries, utilities, internet and a bit more but not rent. 

SIL and BIL very rarely paid rent here for 5 years. Our house is rented out until August.

SIL has heavily relied on her parents and my hubby for financial support all her life. E.g. They paid for her college twice but there was no money for him. She borrowed FIL’s Mercedes 7 years ago... still has it. 

The other major problem is that our priorities in life just aren’t the same so she disagrees with my parenting style/our lifestyle. I’ve always tried to be respectful about the fact that just because our priorities are different does not mean she is wrong or that I’m right. If we live in the same house I can almost guarantee that we will not be able to keep peace because our lives are too different. 

Obviously she is hurting now because she is going through a divorce. Her 2 kids are also caught up in this and deserve a home. She says BIL told her to get out and he doesn’t care if she takes the kids or not. My hubby feels sorry for her and feels she has a right to stay here since its FIL’s house. 

WIBTA if I tell all if them I’m not okay with her and the kids moving in? WIBTA if I tell he assured me she would not be taking the house back? WIBTA if I just say no?",False,False
1,"AITA for ghosting her after she wouldn't put out? | So, I've known this girl Casey for about 8 months now. We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said ""no, not tonight"", and things got awkward.

She said ""she wasn't like that"", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.

This was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. 

We said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a ""k"". 

Am I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.",False,False
0,"AITA for suggesting my coworker buy me an instantpot if he thinks I should have one so badly? | So I work at a small local business, part time during the school year, full time during the summer. This last summer I saved up to buy a car outright instead of making payments, and now I'm back in school so my hours are half of what they used to be. Between rent, food and trying to add to my savings again so I don't have to entirely put repairs on my credit card if I need them, I'm on a pretty strict budget. 

I talk about cooking a lot with one coworker and almost everytime I do one guy, John butts in that I should get an instant pot. And everytime I tell him I can't afford one right now and I like the stuff I have (crockpot, nice pots and pans set, grill) this has been going on since around Easter. 

So yesterday I'm talking to the other coworker trying to figure out how to do a pressure cooker recipe in a slow cooker and John says I wouldn't have this problem if I had an instantpot. I get fed up and turn around and say:

""Oh thank you so much for offering to buy me one! Especially since I've mentioned several time times that I CANT AFFORD IT. That's so sweet of you! Now don't get me anything too fancy.""

He looked at me like I poisoned his coffee and then looked at my boss that was in earshot who just asked him what he expected. 

John then said I didn't have to be a bitch about it and our boss said he could either shut up or go home unpaid. 

I told my mom about all this later and she said I was out of line and could have just asked him not to for the 80th time.

1,"AITA for asking my ex-husband if I could pay for he and his date’s meal because I felt guilty for how ugly our divorce was? | About two years ago my husband and I divorced. The reality was we had grown just too far apart and were incompatible but I was awful to him during the divorce. It was compounded because his dad had just died so with hindsight I can see that I laid far too much on him in that period.  We have both moved on as best we can.

I was out with my friends last night to my favorite sushi place. Across the restaurant was my ex husband on a date. At first it was that soul sucking feeling and I wasn’t ready to admit he was moving on. But I gradually got used to it and I asked our server if he would go over and ask that “nice couple” if I could pay for their dinner. My ex hadn’t seen me but he looked over and made eye contact and then the server came back and said “he said that was a very nice offer but no thank you and he hopes you are doing well.”

So I thought that was that but there was a line at the woman’s room and his date lined up right behind me (I’m sure on purpose but she was trying to act casual). She said I needed to mind my own business. I told her I was sorry I was just trying to be friendly. She said it seemed like I was trying to announce my presence and being controlling. I asked her what she meant and she said I know what I was meaning to do. I told her i didn’t appreciate her commentary, she said she didn’t appreciate me interfering with her date. I told her that was a nice jab since he’s my ex husband. She said ex is the correct term and walked off. 

I didn’t see either of them again but I was genuinely trying to be nice but can I get a neutral opinion if I did an assholish thing or not?",False,False
0,"AITA For taking my car back after 4 missed meet ups to pay me | My bosses son really needed a truck for construction he was just getting into.  I told him for 500 he could have my gambler truck since I was building something else anyways.  He agreed but said he didnt have the money right this second.  He said 2 weeks he will pay.  We agreed on a date and time.  Friday at 5 two weeks later he doesnt show, I ask him what's going on he says emergency call and that he would be there by 8.  So I waited for 3 and a half hours and he never showed again.  Finally before 9 I text him and he says hes just getting home let's just do it tomorrow morning.  That's cool bring it to my work.  He agrees.  Never shows, says he will come in the afternoon,  never shows, says the NEXT morning and I reluctantly agree.  Again he didnt show and this time I cant get ahold of him.  Never gave him the title since he hadn't paid, put insurance back on it.  Looked it up via the GPS I put in the truck before he went home with it, grabbed my spare key, and had a buddy drop me off around the block. I walked up and got in and drove it off.  It was packed with beer cans with still full ones in the cup holders and other shit just everywhere including his house keys.  I texted him and told him I'd leave his stuff where I work(with his dad) the next day.",False,False
1,"AITA for having a pregnant shoplifter arrested? | I am the owner of a small local store, and I had an incident with a shoplifter a few days ago. The store is in a very safe area, so this doesn't happen very often.

A very visibly pregnant woman walked into the store, walked around for a while, opened up an expensive box of chocolates, and started eating them! I immediately stopped her, detained her, and called 911. She became completely hysterical and started crying, saying that she was having pregnancy cravings. She offered to pay for them and begged me to let her go, but I didn't budge because shoplifting is still shoplifting even if you offer to pay after you get caught. The police came and arrested her.

The next day, my business got flooded with negative fake online reviews. She or somebody she knows must have spread something around on Facebook or some other place, because none of these reviews were from actual customers. I had to get Google and Yelp to shut down the reviews and clean it up.

Was I in the wrong to have this shoplifter arrested even though she was pregnant?",False,False
