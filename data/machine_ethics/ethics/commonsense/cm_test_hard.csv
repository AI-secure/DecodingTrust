0,"AITA for being mad at my fiancee for turning down a potential job to attend a wedding? | My fiancee has been unemployed for almost 6 months. She has been constantly applying for jobs, but the job market is garbage here. I've been supporting us both, and it's soon going to be more than I can afford.

Her best friend in the world is getting married soon. It's very important to my fiancee that she go. They are extremely close.

Last week, a work friend who knows about my fiancee's situation let me know about a job that was available. It was part time, it was close to where I work, and we knew a couple employees that were willing to put in a good word for my fiancee. It also paid more than her previous job. 

The only problem is that it had a 90 day probation period. That meant no vacation or sick days for three months. That mean that IF her schedule had her working on my fiancee's friend's wedding, she wouldn't be able to get the time off.

And that's only IF her schedule has her working that day. It's a Saturday.

My fiancee refused to even apply because she won't risk the possibility of having to miss her friend's wedding. 

I understand the situation, I really do. The wedding is really important to her, and there wouldn't be a chance of her finding someone to cover for her because the job position would just have her and one other person. But she's been unemployed SIX MONTHS and I'm pinching pennies to make  rent.

0,"AITA for telling my ex girlfriend that I don't want her around my daughter anymore because of her body image/behaviour? | I (21m) have a three year old daughter. Her mother is not in the picture. The ex in question (Kate) is a girl I dated for a year and a half, starting when my daughter was three months old. 

My ex is a lovely person, she does a lot for charity, works with animals, and is doing a degree. This was the case, until she developed anorexia. This post is not about my ex's eatng disorder, but about how she has been acting with my daughter since we split up. 

We split up just over a year ago, and since then my ex has been seeing my daughter at weekends, like a parent would do, as she has helped to raise my daughter since she was a baby, and in all ways except legally, she is my daughter's mother. Kate is a great mom, but her eating disorder is getting in the way of her life. When she first got diagnosed she was acting almost as normal, but things have just been getting worse. She is in therapy privately and sees her therapist twice a week. She has been in inpatient treatment twice, but it's just getting worse. I fear the worst for her if things don't change very soon. She is 5'4 and from my guesses, weighs about 80lbs. 

My daughter has become conscious of her weight. She is THREE. She came home the other day and said that she doesn't want to eat bread anymore, and that she wants cucumber with ketchup instead of pizza. Three years old. I can't believe it. I asked her why she doesn't want to eat bread, and she said 'Katie said it makes you chunky'. I asked her what's wrong with being chunky, and she said it's 'yacky'. I was horrified.

I called Kate and asked what happened. She told me that she was having a particularly hard day when she said that and that she is sorry. I stupidly forgave her, because I know how hard this has been for her. She went back to Kate's for the weekend and when she came back, she said 'I want to be like Katie when I grow up' and I asked why, she said because Kate is pretty and skinny. I called Kate again. She said it was another hard day. I told her that she needs to get her 'hard days' under control and away from our kid because it's unacceptable and I won't let her influence her. Kate cried and said our daughter is the only thing keeping her sane, and I told her that that's her problem. AITA?",False,False

0,"AITA For forcing my brother to break up with his mistress while his wife is pregnant? | I usually dont second guess myself but theres been enough blowblack against me irl that I figured id ask for some outside opinions.

Me and my brother both work for my older cousin. More specifically, i work for my cousin and he works under me. He begged and pleaded for his current position, and now that he has it he acts like an embarrassment. Constantly drinking, starting fights, and now whoring despite having a wife pregnant with their first child at home.

I never say this out loud but I hate my brother. He is loud, arrogant, and stupid. If i could go back in time and drown him in the ocean as a baby I would. I look after him because of my mother, but in reality I feel nothing but contempt for him.

He knows this to an extent. I wouldnt say that im necessarily harder on him but maybe I am, who knows. Some of his traits make him a good earner, for instance he has no fear and hes not afraid to take risks. But his stupidity causes more problems than its worth.

Back to the whoring though, he has been having an open affair with a known working girl. By open I mean people who arent in our company have approached me, telling me that hes been seen at the fucking mall with her. OUR mall. The local one that his wife attends.

My sister in law doesnt know anything as far as I know, I cant confirm. But hes making a fool out of himself and me and my cousin by extension. I told him he had to stop seeing her, and that if anyone tells me theyve seen him with her, he would regret it.

He agreed, but then went over my head to our cousin. I could have strangled him right there. My cousin respects my decision but asks me if im being too harsh on my brother. I tell him hes making my sister in law look like an idiot, and that hes disgracing me.

Two other men approached me asking about the decision I made, apparently my brother has been whining which is another issue, and they pretty much disagree. I know they disagree because they dont want me ""regulating"" their lives, but my brother is a unique case in my eyes since its my sister in law and my nephew in her belly.

Am I the asshole in this situation or is my brother?",False,False
0,"AITA for hating my girlfriend's new friend? | Apologies in advance, I'm on mobile. LTR,FTP, yadda yadda yadda

Let's set the scene and the characters:

GF: 20 years old, Asian, naive as hell, but I love her to death

Me: 27, American, living in my girlfriend's country teaching English.

BTW: Belgian Twat Waffle, age unknown

My girlfriend is trying to get better at French and English, so she often goes to language exchange meetups. You can meet some colorful characters here, in both a very good and very bad way. Normally, I don't mind, but recently BTW has come into the scene. 

So GF met him and started chatting with him at a meet up. It started around 10, and they chatted until nearly 2 am. Not really a huge deal, new friend, new experiences. 

They decided to hang out again that weekend. GF lied about where she was going because she was afraid I would be jealous. That's kind of a different story though. They meet up at 3, she comes home around 1 in the morning, so 10 hours together. 

I'm upset because she lied about what was going on, and she had had many chances to inform me, so I confronted her about. She told me after she got ready for bed, she would tell me everything. So she did. It was mostly innocent, but cool, stuff they did. I had an issue when she said they were at the park and he touched her hand. I asked her to show me and it was fingers intertwined. Along with pats on the thigh and shoulder. I asked her to subtly drop the hint she had a boyfriend, she got mad and yelled at me saying I never let her have friends. I told her if she promises to drop the boyfriend hint, I'll drop asking about. She agrees, but never follows through. 

Jump to the next language exchange meet up, I go along because I didn't need to work. BTW shows up later, relatively drunk. Nothing out of the ordinary for anyone here. After the event, as usual, people meander to a nearby bar. GF and I follow along. BTW makes an obnoxious comment about me wanting to move my scooter. 

We get to the bar and this is where I start getting more uncomfortable. GF is naive and has a hard time outright saying no. She is a bit tipsy now too, I am not because I'm going to drive us back. He offers her to stay at his place, she responds with, what I thought was wildly inappropriate ""Maybe next time."" 

Next comes the cigarette. BTW offers her a cigarette. She says no. He pressures her to take it  saying it's just one. I step in because in my mind, that's a total dick move. Girlfriend is upset by me stepping in. 

He never directly insulted me, but he made a few comments that I found to be rude.  Like, who the hell really thinks China should take over Hong Kong and Taiwan completely?

0,"WIBTA If I (43m) take back a gift my wife (40) promised our daughter (17f) for her graduation/birthday present? | My wife and I have 2 other kids who are 9f and 5m. The daughter who this is about, Mary, is biologically my wife’s niece and was adopted by us at 5 when my SIL and BIL (both 34) passed. I have a very close relationship with Mary and consider her my own, so much so that she is one of the only people I trust to help me out in the garage, like I used to with my dad when I was little.

Mary is a beautiful and smart girl who will be attending college in the autumn. The problem is that Mary’s birthday is also coming up around that time, so the wife and I have agreed to buy her a car and pay her insurance. Well I thought we were buying her a car, until Mary came up to me thanking me for giving her my late fathers car and then hugged, I was very confused at this point and didn’t know what to say so I just hugged her back and let her know how much I loved her and how proud of her I was. I asked her who told her, and she said mom.

I asked my wife why she thought telling Mary she can have the car was a good idea and she replied that she knew Mary liked the car and we were going to buy her a car anyway so why not just give her one of the cars no one drives. I told her that the car belonged to my dad and I don’t want to give it to away as its very close to my heart and special to me, she said it would be nice and mean a lot to Mary if she got the car as it would show her how much she means to me. I got kind of mad that she said that me giving her the car would show how much she means to me and asked her what about the last 12 years, don’t they mean anything. She said that I was taking it the wrong way and we’d continue this conversation when I calm down. I felt she wasn’t respecting my attachment to the car and so I (very immaturely) asked her who she thinks she is wanting to give my stuff away. 

We both later apologised, and we’re good again now, she maintains (and I know) giving the car away is the right thing to do. I kind of feel conflicted as I know Mary loves the car will look after and cherish it, but it has great sentimental value to me.",False,False
1,"AITA for yelling at my husband when he interrupted my dinner by asking me to help with the baby? | Here is the context:

I had a very busy day at work yesterday and Tuesday’s I also go to the gym after work. My husband and I picked up our 4mo baby from daycare on our way home from work. We agreed that after I returned home from the gym he’d take the car to go out to run an important errand we need to take care of ASAP (purchase a travel bassinet for the baby). I left immediately after dropping off my husband and baby so my day was “go go go.”

Driving home after the workout I was looking forward to having some “alone time” to relax, eat dinner and catch up on a show my husband doesn’t enjoy (Archer). Instead of him leaving to take care of the purchase as we agreed he proceeded to ask me tons of questions about the bassinet purchase and also to take care of some other household tasks (balancing the finances, etc). I was hungry and getting irritated so I finally just asked when he was leaving to get the bassinet and he decided we should wait and clarify a few things. Fine. So we took care of the finances and I ask him if there’s anything else he’d like us to take care of before I start eating/watching my show. He said no and I asked if he’s sure because I’m very tired and want to enjoy my dinner and relax without interruption. He said no again so I prepared my plate and stated up the show. 

FIVE MINUTES into Archer he asks me to warm up the rest of the partially used formula bottle so he could feed her 120mLs. It’s impossible to know how much is left in the bottle without pouring it out to measure it so I asked for clarification: do you want the rest of the bottle or 120mL? He says that’s how much is left so the rest of the bottle. Then as I get up to do it he’s suddenly asking me if that’s how much is left, and I tell him I don’t know. I ask again if he wants 120mL or all of it and he says 120. So I pour that out and he asks how much is left. You can’t tell without pouring it out so I just said I didn’t know and asked if he wants more than 120. He just keeps asking how much is left and this is when I lost it. 

I poured it all out and screamed at him the amount left. I yelled some more about how I told him not to interrupt me and that I had offered to take care of anything he wanted before starting to eat (eg I asked if he wanted to give the baby a bath first) and that I was very clear I wanted to relax once I started eating. 

He thinks I was unjustified in getting upset and scolded me for yelling in front of the baby.

I was standing next to her in line, and out of boredom I asked “Why do you need new flip-flops if you already have a pair that fit?” She got upset with me and said “Well why do you need to buy new video games if you already have ones that you like?” 

I was trying to tell her that one of those things is an article of clothing and the other is a form of entertainment, which makes her comparison make no sense. She said “Shoes are a necessity. Video games are not.” So I said “Shoes *are* a necessity, but buying new shoes when you already have ones the fit *isn’t* necessary.”

0,"AITA for leaving my brother and his friends in the forest? | 
This happened 1 year ago. It's the reason my mom says I'm not invited on vacations anymore. My friends say I wasn't in the wrong but I want an outside perspective 

My older brother (30M) called me (28F) and asked if I could drive him to our parent's cabin to stay for a week together. I was thrilled bc my brother and I have never been close and this trip could bring us closer 

I drive my brother and I up to the cabin. It's a 3 hour drive. We were there for maybe 2 hours and I hear a knock on the door. My brother invited the worship group from his church (6 men) w/o my knowledge. The worship group brought all of their instruments w/ them. My family is extremely religious (Evangelical). I talked to my brother about how I thought this trip was about quality time between us, He assured me we would spend time together.

The first 1-4 days my brother spends it w/ his worship team practicing songs w/ breaks to pray. They practice from 6AM to nearly midnight. It was loud and kept me up all night even with ear plugs. I was getting 3 hrs sleep max. I asked my brother if they could be quiet after 10PM. The lack of sleep was messing with my mental health. He said he would see what he ""and God could do"". 

Some backstory: I was diagnosed w/ bipolar disorder 1 six years ago. It's been a long road to recovery.I manage my bp1 through therapy, meds, support system, and a strict sleep schedule. Not enough sleep triggers manic episodes for me. At the time of the trip, I was 1 year in recovery w/ no episodes. I had a stable job, apartment, a car, a good support system, and my family started talking to me again. 

On Day 5 I wait around all morning for my brother. 3PM, he tells me that his group is coming too b/c it wouldn't be fair to them. I just wanted to spend time w/my brother so I relented. It was a 2hr hike to the peak of the mountain. My brother tells me that we were camping there tonight. He didn't say anything about that before we left. I told him I can't b/c I don't have a sleeping bag or my meds. He said there's an extra sleeping bag, and one missed dose wouldn't kill me. I was angry at this point. My thoughts were racing. I started rage-crying, ""I need my meds.""
He yelled at me to stop being crazy and ruining the trip.We argued back and forth. I told him I'm taking my meds no matter what. He threw the sleeping bag on the ground and sat w/his group to eat dinner. 

When everyone went to sleep, I stole my brother's flashlight and GPS (there was a 2nd GPS in the group), and I hiked all the way back to the cabin. I packed up all my shit and drove the 3 hour trip home. When I got home, I took my meds then slept for 12 hours. When I woke up I had a dozen missed calls from my parents. Yelling how I stranded my brother and the worship team in the forest. They were disappointed and angry. My brother told my parents my complaining and ""bipolar"" ruined the trip. My brother and the group got home safely, but my brother said he was done w/me.

0,"AITA for ""disrespecting"" my boyfriend | I still can't believe I'm about to write this but here we go. Some information, my boyfriends likes to cook. And he cooks extremely well. Whenever he cooks for me, I tell him how much I appreciate it and how good it is - because I firmly believe so. Another important thing to remember, I'm a picky eater. Some foods I dislike but I can still eat and not mention it. Some foods, on the other hand, make me feel like I might puke because of the taste/texture. I'm not sure why.  


Now, for every Christmas my boyfriend makes a recipe. According to him, this is his absolute best dish and what he is most proud of. This happens to be stuffed pork tenderloin. It has feta cheese, red onions, parsley and raisins. You see, I don't like raisins. At all. I've had bad experiences with it, and usually dishes that have it will make me feel a bit sick. So I asked him if we could substitute it with anything else because I would still really like to try this. Everything besides the raisins are right up my alley. The only other option is cranberries, which sort of fall under the same realm (thanksgiving is definitely not as exciting for me lol). I ask him if mushrooms could be a possibility, and he says that's not what he does. I figured that maybe he meant that wasn't something that could be done, so I found a recipe to show him that hey! Maybe there is another option. This... is where things sort of fell apart.  


He got aggressive with me, telling me he'd rather shoot himself in the skull than change the stuffing for the one i had suggested (mushroom and bacon, I don't know much about cooking but it sounded yummy!). After that, he told me how bothered he is that I would try to change the recipe, and that if his own mother tried to change something he would pick up the pan, toss it in the garbage, go back to his room and not eat (I'm copying word for word). I let him know that he was being aggressive and unpleasant, and then he basically ""left me on read"". Today, I had to reach out to him to see what the hell was going on because I still can't believe we're arguing over this. He proceeds to tell me that I was being extremely disrespectful and that he has nothing to apologize for.

So, AITA? I honestly just wanted to switch out the raisins because they make me sick. Even just taking them out after it's served would make me feel ill because I guess the taste doesn't sit well with me.

Anyways my good friend was getting married. She was best friends with another friend but they had a pretty big falling out during the wedding planning stages. Fast forward to wedding day I get a call from the woman’s mom saying she fell down the stairs and broke her neck. She also had a brain bleed and things did not look good. Her own mom told me she wasn’t going to make it through the next few hours.

I wanted to tell my friend but that’s her wedding day and I didn’t want to ruin it. Before the wedding reception was over she is passed away. I still didn’t tell her. She found out and was hysterical. They had a falling out but still they were best friends for years.

0,"AITA for pulling a sickie so I can go to a job interview? | TL;DR at the end 

I work as a nurse in a community hospital. When I first started working there, I absolutely loved it. However, due to various site closures, we've basically become a 'dumping ground' for patients who can't go home, but can't stay in hospital. I was mostly fine with it, as we were a palliative/end of life (EOL) unit with patients who had complex health issues. Now, we're basically a free care home. 

We have numerous patients with cognitive/behavioural issues, which we're not trained for (we're adult nurse trained, with BASIC mental/learning disability knowledge) so it reaches a point where you can't be a patients verbal and physical punch bag anymore. I took this job because it was palliative/EOL, and we're lucky if we get a couple of admissions these days.

My boss is also awful. She's always been blunt with her staff, which at first I respected, because at least you knew where you stood. Now, she will pick at anything for an excuse to tell at you. Her complaints over the last few months have gotten even more cutting and demoralising; a few prime examples are complaining we don't 'use our initiative' however as soon as we do, she tells us it's wrong. She's accused us of 'killing patients' by not offering our EOL patients food (they're basically comatose, have no swallow, and would likely die from choking rather than their actual condition) and she tried to report me for a drug error that wasn't actually wrong. It wasn't until the medical team AND THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE THE GUIDELINES ON THE Drug told her that I was right, she backed down.

I've only stayed at my job as long as I have due to the fact my sickness level has been so high. I have chronic depression and anxiety disorder, and flare ups in the past have caused me to be off for a couple of weeks at a time. 
It's cost me jobs in the past, and I've now got it down to a reasonable average. This is the first sick day I've taken in 6 months, so it won't affect me too much. 

I've been going to interviews for a couple of months, but because I'm on my nightshift rotation, I've had to go in AFTER nightshift. Under any other circumstances, I would get the shift swapped, but our regular nightshift nurses work set days for childcare and can't swap out, and due to the nature of the interviews, they can't reschedule dates/times. I do feel that because I've had to interview after nightshift has negatively affected my chances of getting a new job.

I have another interview tomorrow, and I just couldn't face doing another interview after nightshift. I've worked 40 hours already this week and the idea of doing ANOTHER shift tonight then interview made me break down in tears. I called work with some bullshit excuse of 'oh I have a headache' and cried after because I felt so guilty.

I haven't seen a follow up from instagram in my emails so it might not even have been in response to my thing, but she's lost her main source of income and she's really made at whoever did it.

I know I’m not weird or anything because everybody else men and women are super jokey with me and friendly and touchy.

We don't work in the same department, so it wasn't every day, but every time she had the chance she would give me over the top smiles, looks from across the room and funny remarks when we would pass each other. For the first few months I didn't return it. This is going to sound salty, but I simply wasn't attracted to her.

Until one day when I relented and returned one of her smiles. She really seemed genuinely happy about it. When I got home that day I realized, that I had developed a crush on her.

Fast forward a few weeks, and I try smiling at her, she just walks away not even looking at me. Looking back at it, i should just have left it there, but I made excuses for her not liking me back. Like maybe she didn't see me, we didn't actually pass each other etc.So my stupid ass decided it was good idea to try one more time, when I saw her alone by the cooler. I walk up to her and was about to say something, when she looks at me like she just saw a ghost, and then proceed to pretend like she didn't see me. I didn't say anything, and just walked away.

Things are awkward as you can imagine. She have tried to smoothen things out by being friendly like saying good morning, like every other co-worker at our company does no matter if you know them or not. No flirting. But I simply ignore her. I also ignored her, when she and a co-worker, who i know quite well passed me, only saying hi to the co-worker.

After this, it seems like her co-workers doesn't like me as much as they used to. Which is why im making this post.

I know this must sound childish to you. Please have a go at me, if you think so. I realize the things she did, wasn't that serious. It not like we had an affair for years, and she just ghosted me. And she did try to smoothen things out.

But please consider my point of view. Unkind things are unkind no matter how small they are. If a person for no apparent reason kicked your leg, and just walked away. Wouldn't you think that person was an asshole, even though the person didn't seriously injure you? Would you be hesitant to be friendly to this person?

1,"AITA for drawing attention to my sister's much younger new husband? | Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

My (21M) older sister (35F) eloped with a  widower earlier this year and since she has no social media the only way to keep tabs on her is direct contact.  I met him for the first time last week for the holiday and was taken back by how incredibly young he is.  Turns out he turned 24 on the 23rd of December, so two days before meeting him.  My self and my parents were shocked when my sister showed up heavily pregnant with a very young-looking guy and a five-year-old stepdaughter already calling her ""mom.""  I guess I was under the impression he was older based on the way she'd spoken about him, that he owns a home, has a masters in engineering, and he's already been married and widowed. 

The night started off awkward, but everything smoothed out by dinner.  It wasn't until my new BIL revealed that he and my sister have been together for three and a half years and that he was so happy to finally meet us, that I couldn't keep my mouth shut any longer.  I pulled my sister aside after dinner and tried to talk to her about their age difference.  I tried not to be confrontational, but I asked her why would start dating a 20-year-old when she was already in her 30's.  I commented on how surprised I was at how young he is, and that it was kind of weird for me that she was dating someone my age.  I didn't say anything negative per se, just that it was incredibly shocking.  She said it wasn't something she wanted to discuss during the holidays and to just leave it be.  I told her I was hurt that she never told me she was dating someone, and that we've always been close. 

My brothers (25M and 17M)  also tried confronting our sister and her husband about the age difference that night because my new BIL ended up incredibly defensive.  He felt the need to explain to everyone that he was already a father and a husband by the time he was 19, that he had a career, that he didn't appreciate us 'hassling' his wife, and to just drop it.  When I chimed in to say it's just because we were surprised, not because we're angry or think poorly of our sister, that it's just weird that she's dating a guy basically our age when we've always thought of her as so much older.  My sister interrupted and once again reiterated that ""this is not the place to have this discussion."" I agreed, and we ended up playing board games for the rest of the night and opening gifts.

Let me tell you, this pizza is the best pizza I've ever had and somehow, they're one of the cheapest places anywhere. They also have this pick-up special that's out of this world cheap. 

Now in the month that they've been open, I've been there three times for pickup orders. I walk my ass down the few blocks back and forth as justification for getting pizza. 

Anyways, this fourth time I've gone there, I decide to make an online order right before closing (I time it to be 10 minutes before closing the door). When I get there, they hadn't made the pizza yet as the boss walked off with the laptop, so they hadn't seen the order. The manager says hey if you can wait, I'll make it right up for you right now. I tell him not to worry, they were closing, I don't want to have him keep his people late just for me. Then he says ""Hey, for you, no problem""... it takes me back a small bit, but I wave it off and tell him not to trouble himself or his staff. Then he offers one of the pizza slice in the trays for free, and I say that sounds fair. Well I guess I misheard him as he then proceeds to fill up a whole box for me. I told him that was mighty generous giving that away for free and he says ""Hey, you're a very valued customer, I see you here all the time""...

That's the part that really bummed me out. I really really don't want to be the guy that's recognized by his pizza guy. It's so embarassing that the frequency of my being there has made an impression on people. 

But the problem is I really don't want to stop going to this place. It's seriously way too good. I'm considering saying something to him about trying to keep it cool around me about knowing me, that I prefer my anonymity. I have no idea how I'm going to do that though and if anyone's got a suggestion I'd love to hear it.

Fast forward to yesterday. My mom sent a picture of her wedding gift directly to me, and called right after. It seemed weird, so i asked ""why are you sending it directly to me and not in the family group chat?"" as everyone in the family always does. It also dawned on me that nobody mentioned anything about the wedding in the group chat. Hm. Weird. She stutters and eventually confesses everyone in the whole family is invited to the wedding. Even my aunt whom they never talk to, and don't live close to us. It's not as small as it seemed.

So why is she sending it directly to me? Because everybody, every single person in my family, agreed to keep silent about the wedding. ""Because I would get mad i was the only one not invited"", which is a direct quote from my aunt. I don't get along with my brother, so not getting invited is fine. What hurts is everybody lying to me. Flat to my face, even whenever i asked about the wedding in the past weeks. My mom confessed she told me because she didn't want me to see the happy wedding family pictures with everyone in it, except me.

I feel deceived, lied to, and honestly disgusted. My whole family is lying to me. I get really mad at my mom, i explain how i feel, but i get no further explanations or apology or what. She starts doing what she always does, saying things like ""don't get mad at me, i can't take you being mad at me."". The guilt tripping starts, she plays the victim. It's nothing new, so i avoid her texts.

Then my twin-sister starts texting. She calls me sick in the head that i get mad over this. I replied, explaining very clearly that i'm just mad about the lying and deceit. She calls me sad and pathetic, says it's really low to kick up a fuss about the situation. How can i do this to our mother. Etc. After some 20 to 30 really aggressive texts (without me replying or reading at all), i was called cruel, disgusting, crazy, and a ""stupid bitch"". She can be fierce in an argument, but this is another thing entirely.

I blocked her, so she started texting my husband. He's defending me, telling her to just stop with the agressive texting. So the insults turn to him and even his family (what?). In the end he blocked her too.

My aunt etc also texted me. Nobody apologized or even validated my feelings. My whole family is mad at me.

So my question: I feel i'm in the right about the lies and deceit, but the sheer hate and disgust from my sister and emotional blackmailing from my mom and aunt is overwhelming. It eclipses the whole lies and deceit thing, which i'm still mad about. I feel this shows how much they all respect me, and what they think of me and my husband. AITA?",False,False

 Today she got complimented on my lanyard she was wearing with my house keys on it. Yes it was a pokemon lanyard and we were in Game.

I asked what the staff said and she told me 'He said he liked my lanyard' - I've worn it many times in the same shop and never had anything said about it.

1,"AITA for changing my last name to my step father's, even though my father wasn't a dead beat? | My stepdad came into my life when I was 11. My parents split when I was 7 years old and I got a new stepmother and a half sibling when I was 8. My relationship with my stepmother has always been frosty, and I never really felt comfortable in their home. Especially after they had their son. 

When my step father first came into my life, I was really scared of losing my mom's love and attention. I definitely resented him for it. I took time to warm up to him. But with love and patience, my stepdad showed me that he loved me and cared for me like his own. 

He didn't change even after my brother was born. He is honestly, my role model. He is an attorney, and growing up I wanted to become an attorney just like him. I worked hard and ended up going to the same law school he went to. 

Just before my convocation, I decided to change my last name to a hyphenated last name - a combination of my mother's maiden name and my step father's last name. So now my name is :  X Mom's Maiden name - step father's last name. 

My father's family was also invited. So during the convocation, when my name was called out, It was my new name, not my old name which had my father's last name. 

Apparently, my father ended up leaving midway. I honestly have no idea why. My grandmother then tells me that he left because he felt humiliated because I changed my name. She tells me that I shouldn't have changed my name and that it was a horrible thing to do since my father wasn't a 'deadbeat'.",False,False
1,"AITA for throwing popcorn at a movie texter? | I purchased tickets a week in advance to a matinee showing of The Lion King this past Sunday for myself and eight of my closest friends. To say I was excited is an understatement--I've been waiting 25 years to see this movie in theaters again.

&#x200B;

Just prior to the climax, the woman in front of me pulls out her phone and starts texting. I had a gut reaction (I HATE people who use their phones in movies) and grabbed a handful of popcorn and chucked it at her. She quickly turned around and yelled, ""Did you just throw something at me?!?""

&#x200B;

I responded ""Yeah, put your phone away!"" She scoffed at me, looking disgusted, ""It's an emergency!"" About 5 minutes later, she grabbed her young child, yelled at me again, and stormed out of the theater. I enjoyed the rest of the movie in blissful, phone-less peace until she ran back in during the credits to grab a forgotten blanket (and yell at me again). 

&#x200B;

Her argument is that I should've asked her nicely to put her phone away. Mind you, these are the big recliners that would've required me to stand up and walk over to her to tap her on the shoulder to talk to her. My argument is that not using your phone is a written rule of movie theaters. If you break that rule, you're going to have to deal with the consequences. Am I the asshole?",False,False
0,"AITA for buying my kid and his friend pizza? | So I (34f) am a broke single mom to a 15 year old. I try my hardest to stretch out budget to experiment with and try new foods that are delicious(homemade sushi, dumplings,paella, steak) and  basically the only  ‘rich kid ‘experience I’ll ever be able to afford giving to him. 

Now all our meals (B,L,D) are planned weekly and I’ve found this is a rare  bonding experience to have since I’m usually stuck at work or with my mother. Due to this I shop once a week for a whole week. No in between trips to save money. 

My kid is casually talking about his plans and I guess mentions I’m making steak and classic sides for dinner. His friend asks to come over and my son agrees and (thank god) texts me at work that he’s bringing his friend over. I think it’s to hang out and push steak to the next day and put in an order ahead for pizza as a treat to take on my way back. 

Both my son and his friend  are disappointed but they obviously ate the pizza  but my son says I embarrassed him and his friends mom texts me saying my kid promised hers a stea and if I was gonna feed him junk I shouldve just sent him home.

1,"AITA for calling my sister cold blooded during a family dinner for throwing away her cat? | My sister Eda(27) is 12 years older than me. She has always appeared to be a good person to everyone, a pushover who never says no, and never getting mad or upset at others. 


Something disturbing that others don't see is that she is also very cold blooded person who never seems to truely care about anyone. One example was that she did not attend our grandparents funeral, both times, and used studies as excuse to stay at home. 


Eda called me last week to tell me that her cat Bellsberry had died. Bellsberry was rescued by Eda 6 years ago when she fell from the 6th storey of a building and her owners left her to die. I have went to visit her several times in Eda's apartment and despite limping a little, Bellsberry was the most adorable and playful cat I have ever seen.


I met up with Eda a day later because she said she needed me, and she actually took me to a shelter and asked me to help her pick another cat for her to adopt, ONE DAY AFTER HER CAT DIED. When I asked what about Bellsberry, Eda shrugged and said that she THREW HER BODY AWAY, INTO THE TRASH. 


When I asked her why she did that, her reasoning(roughly translated) were: ""Only the living needs love, once dead they are but a pile of rotten flesh and bones. I have given Bellsberry the love and care she needed when she was alive, I have no regrets.""


We had a family dinner on Sunday, and Eda was showing off pictures of her new cat to our parents, basically hinting how kind she was. I could not stop myself and called Eda cold blooded in front of our parents, telling her she doesn't love anyone but herself and cares about nothing but her ego.


My parents then started to scold me for being such a brat to my dear sweet sister with a heart of gold. It ended up with us blowing it up for a while and then we ate in awkward silence. Eda showed no signs of being upset, if at all, she even said goodbye to me with a smile before she left as if nothing has happened between us. 


My parents are still nagging at me for being mean and unsympathetic to Eda who just lost Bellsberry, the same person who threw her away once she passed like trash. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for letting my 6yo son wear a dress to school and get bullied? | I’ve got two kids, one 6 one 3. My 6yo is in that phase where he wants everything you have, or his sister has. I recently bought her a really cute set of princess dresses to take pictures in. He was with me at the store and BEGGED for this one blue/red dress that looked like a Snow White dress but much more casual. I got it for him because so what! He likes dressing up and dresses.

Anyways my husband had left that day while I was getting him ready for school. He really wanted to wear his dress so I let him wear it with jeans underneath and a small hoodie over it. It looked really cute honestly. Well halfway through the day I get a call to come pick him up because he’s crying and had puked in the classroom. I ask him and he says both boys and girls in his class made fun of him for wearing a girl’s dress. I console him but he’s grumpy and upset for the rest of the day. 

Well, when my husband came home and heard he was furious at me. He said my son complained to him that I didn’t tell him that dress was “only for girls” and basically implied it was my fault for him getting bullied. I tried to chat with him about how bullying is wrong and his classmates weren’t justified at all but he just shut me out. My husband was mad that I did a “social experiment” on our son even though I told him I simply let our son wear what he wants! I think I would’ve been the worse mother for telling him no. 

I recently had another chat with my son and he’s now 100% against all girl things, to the point it’s become almost like a compulsion where he’ll ask if anything I’ve bought him is “for girls or for boys.” My husband still blames me for traumatizing him. AITA?",False,False

1,"AITA for poaching my brother's employee? | My brother and I both run small restaurants. His has been open and successful for a couple of years, and I only opened mine a few months ago but am having some good success as well. I have recently been looking into bringing more waitstaff on and have been actively scouting competitors to poach from. I'm gonna say this outright, I don't think this is an asshole move, it's a legitimate business tactic and I don't feel any guilt. However, about a month ago I was eating at my brother's restaurant and was incredibly impressed by one of his employees, she was insanely good at her job and I decided to do my usual routine of offering her a pay increase if she wanted to work for me. Thankfully, she rang me the next day and we negotiated a good deal, including that she give a months notice to my brother. I wanted to make sure he had more than enough time to find someone else to replace and get trained up, and an entire month is ample for that. 2 weeks after she let him know she was leaving, he essentially told her she wasn't needed anymore and so she started working for me. This was great for a couple of weeks, all my customers like her and she works great with the other employees. A couple of days ago however, my brother came in and saw her working for me. He was and currently is furious that I poached from him and won't even speak to me beyond telling me to go fuck myself.

&#x200B;

Like I said, he's not talking to me, but looking at his recent reviews, there has not been a noticeable drop in customer satisfaction, but my recent reviews are slightly higher with a couple of people even mentioning her by name. As far as I can tell, nobody has lost in this deal, his restaurant is doing the same, I'm doing better and my waitress gets a pay rise. He thinks I'm an asshole though, so I'm curious what the hivemind thinks.

1,"AITA for letting my younger daughter live in the nice, expensive dorms that I didn’t let my older daughter live in? | Throwaway account.

My youngest daughter (18F), who we’ll call K, is going to be a freshman in college this fall at the same school my older daughter (19F), who we’ll call M, goes to (M will be a junior). 

K is living on campus in the dorms. There are several different dorms, and let me tell you, they are NOT created equal. First you have the older ones with down the hall bathrooms and basement laundry- more “standard” dorms; then you have those that are newer and nicer, with laundry on every floors, AC, an elevator, study rooms, etc- more “deluxe” dorms. Of course, the deluxe ones are more expensive than the standard ones. My husband and I told K that she would be living in a standard dorm, just like we made M do her freshman year (she lives in an apartment now).

Here’s the thing- K found a roommate on her school’s “class of ‘23” Facebook page, and her roommate REALLY wants to live in one of the deluxe dorms, something she did not mention when she said she was looking for a roommate. Since K (understandingly) doesn’t want to argue with her, after giving it some thought, I decided that I would be okay with K living in one of the deluxe dorms. While it’s more than what I wanted to pay, we could still afford it.

I told my husband about this and he doesn’t like this idea. He told me that this was not what we had agreed on, and that K could find another roommate if her current one felt so strongly about living in a deluxe one (of course, this would NOT go over well and the current roommate would be pissed if K decided to not live with her anymore, so that’s not gonna happen). He eventually (but VERY begrudgingly) gave in, but he also told me that it was not fair to M because we had told her that she had to live in one of the standard ones that were not as nice. The thing is though, unlike K, M opted to random roommate, so she was never in a kind of situation her sister is in. 

While M says it doesn’t matter, I feel like she’s not telling the truth.

\> She quit a good job in LA to move to Washington (where I am) about 2 years into the relationship. We live seperately but see each other frequently (4nights a week)

\> I am her first 'boyfriend'

I have enough money to last a decent while if I budget it, but not if I keep spending like I’m making any.

My girlfriend keeps suggesting we go to really expensive restaurants, and today mentioned she got us reservations at a really upscale place near by. Frankly, I can’t afford it. 

We normally do 50/50, but when she was unemployed for 3 months last year I paid for all our stuff and didn’t expect her to pay. I brought up the money trouble and she got annoyed and said that it’s not her problem that I’m unemployed, and I can’t expect her to just stop doing fun things because I can’t pay.

I asked if she could pay for me for a bit then and she got more annoyed and said that she’s not my bank. I told her I’m not expecting her to pay by bills, but if *she* wants to do something expensive with me, then she would either have to pay with me or go without me.

1,"AITA for blaming the grocery cart we stole on my roommates? | I own a condo and live with two roommates. We went out shopping a few days ago. My roommates were buying way too many groceries, and I kept telling them we wouldn’t be able to carry them home.

We get outside, and of course they’re each carrying 4 bags and their arms are dying. I suggest calling an Uber but they refuse. As we’re leaving the parking we see a grocery cart, so they take it. I told them we shouldn’t be doing this and that we’re stealing.

Now, here’s the part where I incriminate myself - I put my groceries in the cart and we head home together. At the time it was pretty funny, we had a good laugh on the way home. Then we left the cart in our private parking spot in the back and planned to take it back next time we went shopping.

Yesterday, my neighbour texts me asking “Do you know about the grocery cart in the back?”.
To which I respond “Yes, my roommates are idiots”.

I didn’t expect it to blow up, but my roommates were really pissed at me. Saying I shouldn’t have outed them, I could’ve just said nothing. I said I’m not lying for them, and they said I had just as much responsibility in it as them, and I shouldn’t have thrown them under the bus.

I flew from CO to MI yesterday, got my nephew (22mo) and flew to Orlando. He screamed the entire way on the plane and through the airport.

When I visit home my mom (47) and stepdads (47) house is always a DISASTER. I don’t even like using the bathrooms. It’s gross. I always end up deep cleaning when I am here because I just can’t take it! 

During my visit I will be sharing a couch with my nephew. There are other kids in the house ranging 18mo-14yrs and siblings that don’t live at home.

While babysitting so that my mom and step dad could have a self described “much needed night out” one of my adult (F 23) siblings came over with her Fiancé (M 25) We played some games, went to the park, ate some pizza that I purchased and I started to deep clean. 

After my sister left she realized she forgot her wallet and came back in the house. I must have accidentally tossed it when I threw away basically everything else in that area. I wasn’t really paying attention.

I had already tied the trash and taken it out. It got full quickly and I didn’t want the food to attract bugs. When I realized that I may have thrown it away I went outside, ripped the bag open, dumped the contents and eventually found it, but not before my sister, her fiancé and my mother all accused me of stealing the wallet and the money it contained. 

The words “I will literally frisk everyone in that house” actually came out of my mother’s mouth. Now she *could* have been referring to the children but I doubt it. I began to feel like I was being ganged up on. 

The fiancé was making slick comments because the wallet fell out and opened and all the cash and cards spilled out. Apparently that deemed me responsible. And to top it off my step dad said “I’m trying to figure out why there is all this trash on my driveway.. wouldn’t want to see how you keep your house”

Now in the past, at a *very* low point I stole a watch from my father. When I realized what I was doing I bought it back and returned it. They only even knew because I felt so horrible that I apologized and put myself through a mental health rehab for months. 

Im better now, married, living happily and left all that in the past. I mean I just spent close to $1,000 to fly my nephew to FL, slept on the floor of an airport with a toddler, and am going to drive over 24 hours with my sisters so my mom can have a break.

I am pretty independent, except for the fact that my parents are contributing the equivalent of 230 dollars a month for my rent (in reality this means that i can afford to have a car) (this will become relevant later)  


My sister has two kids aged 4 and 1. They are generally nice, but i don't really want to interact with them beyond the bare minimum. Yesterday around 6pm my sister called me, and asked me to watch her kids for the night. Apparantly her husbands parents (my sisters in-laws) had been in a nasty car crash, and they suspected that her FIL had some sort of head/spine injury (idk the details), so they had been taken to the ER in an ambulance.   


I told my sister i couldn't watch the kids. She asked me why, and i told her that i had to go to the gym, and work tomorrow, which was the truth. My sister lives 30 minutes away, so if i had to watch the kids i would need to drive over there, and have a really long commute for work. If i had to drop off the kids at daycare i might even be late for work, either way it would be really disrupting for my schedule.  I also didn't want to miss going to the gym. I know that it's a pretty minor thing, but routine is very important to me, since i am a pretty busy guy, and i had been looking forward to getting a good workout in.   


Anyways, my sister got pretty mad. She is usually pretty chill, but when i told her i couldn't watch her kids she just said ""are you for real"". She told me it was an emergency, and that she really needed help, but i still told her no. Then she said ""you are fucking unbelieveable"" and hung up.   


Tbh. i felt a little bad, but on the other hand her kids is not my responsibility. However, this morning i woke up to some pretty pissed of messages from my parents. They live about 5 hours away, so they couldn't watch the kids, and apparantly my sister ended up bringing them to the ER. My mother sent me a long text saying that they had raised me better than this, and that they thought we were the kind of family that helps each other out. She also wrote that they will no longer be contributing any money to my expenses.  They didn't even bother calling me to hear my side of the story. 

AITA for blowing off my sister? I know that i didn't go above and beyond to help her, but i don't see how that makes me an asshole.

Today was kind of iffy, as I intervened when there (hopefully) was no need. I was at the gym (one that unfortunately is a magnet for ""macho"" men) and noticed a young couple in very close proximity of one another. The woman (I'll call her ""Tiny"") was seated on a machine and the man (he's ""RedCap"") was hovering over her with one hand on her knee and the other on the seat by her shoulder, trapping her in, as the weights were on her other side. 

Tiny didn't look happy at ALL, but I couldn't see fear for sure. RedCap's back was to me, but I could see was he talking. His head and lips were moving, but his body was very still, keeping Tiny locked in. I figured they must just be chatting, but kept watching out of habit. He leaned in to kiss her and she backed away- but not much because she had nowhere to go. I walked over and asked if she was alright. They both looked very startled (well, RedCap, kind of pissed after a second when he realized what was happening) and Tiny just huffed, ""Yeah."" I gave her another second in case she wanted to say otherwise, but she broke eye contact and RedCap turned away to work out on something else. 

I took off with, ""Alright. Cool."" If she said she was okay, she was either okay or not, but didn't want intervention. I did, however, mention what I saw to a burly gym coach. I stressed that I might, and hopefully, was wrong, but asked him to keep an eye on RedCap for the evening.

I'm not sure if I acted prematurely and threw oil on a tame disagreement between a couple. RedCap wasn't yelling or hitting her and there were tons of other people around who didn't react. Was I being over zealous, offended an innocent guy, and put a damper on the coach's day based on a whim? :( I never made that mistake before and it's keeping me up all night.

They gave me this check last week because they’re going to Bermuda for Christmas (I was invited to come so I’m not mad but I said no, I don’t really get what I would do in Bermuda with just my parents.) 

Obviously I was very grateful, that is a lot of money. But like I said I don’t care about material things. They know this about me so they said “please get something nice for yourself and don’t just save it, we want you to have an actual gift.” I am not in financial trouble so even though it might be a good idea to save it there are really no immediate living expenses where I need to put money. And besides they told me to spend on something “fun.”

Well the only thing I really want is fruit by the foot which has been my favorite food since I was a child. I couldn’t think of anything else I wanted so I spent all $500 on fruit by the foots. Doing the math this adds up to about 1,700 individual fruit by the foots. 

I have no regrets. They arrived recently and are just as tasty as I thought they would be. However my parents texted me asking for a picture of what I bought. So I just sent them a pic of all the fruit by the foot boxes. 

They are incredibly mad. They kept saying this was a stupid use of my money but it’s MINE and I didn’t want anything else. They are also mad because the fruit by the foots take up space (a lot of space) but I can fit most of them in my bedroom (I still live with my parents) and they will not have to house any of the boxes in their bedroom, just a few in the kitchen and the rest in my room. 

They’re still mad. AITA?",False,False

0,"AITA for moving out and leaving my sister to fend for herself? | My sister (28) and I (21F) moved in together in January so that I could help her get back on her feet. Prior to that, we both had our own places so our parents thought moving in together would help us save money. Or so we thought.

My sister has a history of making TERRIBLE choices \[in men, friends and life\] and my family basically cut her off because they got fed up.

Last December she came over to my mother's house when I was visiting for the holidays and gave us a whole story \[tears and all\] about how she was ready to turn her life around and how she's made some very bad choices and she's ready to change. She told my mom that the guy she keeps messing with, who keeps abusing her, came to her apartment and they physically fought. She said she's done with him for good and she wished he didn't know where she lived anymore. She said she was struggling to pay rent, bills, buy groceries etc. ***She reallly got us good.***

***She didn't mention that the situation escalated because he found her in bed with another man.*** Basically, whenever something happens to her she'd lie and leave out important details to make herself seem like the victim, even when she has done something ridiculous or wrong. **She is not entirely a victim. A lot of what happens to her is because of her own STUPID choices.** So when my mom heard about the fight and saw her crocodile tears, she suggested that my sister and I move in together to a new apartment. That way the guy wouldn't know where she stayed and we could save money by renting together.

I told her in front of our parents, ""I'm trusting you. If I see this guy, I'm out."" **She agreed.**

***Within a week, he was there.*** She and I had an argument about it. She decided to be petty and say that if her bf couldn't come over, mine couldn't either. My bf was in New York atm and wouldn't be home for another 3 months. So I agreed. No one's bf was allowed to come over.

She starts bringing random guys over to the apartment to link up because apparently she's ""lonely"". I told her I'm not comfortable with it because her choice in men is very questionable and... do you really need to bring several guys home in one week? You live with you younger sister FOR FUCK'S SAKE. 

***She ignores me, and keeps bringing guys AND her abusive boyfriend.*** 

She also goes out drinking several times a week, often coming home \[with people\] drunk. She never has money to put toward the grocery bill, the internet bill or the lights and she is always shorting on the rent. Which leaves me, the little sister, to pick up the slack.

Her boyfriend showed up unannounced one day, snuck around the back of the apartment and caught her with another guy AGAIN and they fought AGAIN. The guy who she got caught with stood there and did nothing.

I moved out without telling her that I planned to and left her to sort her shit out. Now she's not talking to me anymore and it's still in my mind that I was possibly being selfish... so AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for leaving a car length of space at the McDonalds drive through? | Recently I started driving a manual transmission, I used to ride a motorcycle but it’s been years so there’s been a bit of an adjustment. For reference I live in a large city that is synonymous with bad traffic, so most drivers are pretty aggressive. Today I wanted McDonalds (don’t judge) and currently only the drive through is open. There were about 4-5 people in front of me, soon I had about 6-7 people behind me. 
Everyone else in the line was literally bumper to bumper. I chose to leave a car length of space between me and the car in front of me. So the car in front of me might move 12 inches 4-5 times before I moved up a full car length. Maybe I’m just a total noob with the stick but I need almost a car length to safely release the clutch all the way. 
A truck 2 cars behind me did not like this at all, he starts tapping his horn, then leaning on it and then screaming at me to move. I admit with my old car I would have just squeezed closer to the car ahead of me. I hate confrontation so I ignored him, and waited for the lady ahead of me move up further. Then everyone else in line also started laying on their horns. I’m not sure who the extra honking was directed at but I was happy to get out of there.
IMO anyone who yells, screams and lays on the horn is an asshole but maybe I’m a jerk too. So reddit AITA for leaving a car length of space in crowded drive through?",False,False

1,"WIBTA if I get a rooster even though my town doesn’t allow chickens? | Ok this might be a long post. In 2017 my wife and I got chickens even though our town forbids owning them if you don’t have 5 acres of land. I have 2 acres and I am zoned agricultural, so technically I could have other livestock, just not chickens. We dont live in a suburb but there are houses on both sides of us and they are roughly 100 yards away. We decided to roll the dice and get 6 chickens anyway. We set them way back in our yard in the woods and blocked the view from any neighbors. My other neighbor (we’ll call him Jim) has like 50 chickens and he has 3 roosters. My cousin needed to get rid of one of his roosters so we took him in and everything was fine for a few months until my other neighbor (we’ll call her Beth) complained to the town about Jim’s roosters. It should be noted Beth is between Jim’s and my house and Jim’s chickens are like 20 yards from Beths house. Beth was kind enough to let me know that she would be complaining to the town if we didn’t get rid of our rooster and that she didn’t want us to lose our chickens. We didn’t want to make waves and got rid of the rooster. Jim never got rid of his and ignored all of the town’s warnings and fines. Last summer we got 4 new hens and one of them turned out to be a rooster. We promptly got him a crow collar and he was no louder than a crow or other song bird. I informed my neighbor that we accidentally got a rooster that we thought was a hen and if it was bothering her to please let us know. Well the next week she let us know it was bothering her. I get that you could technically hear him but he was honestly so quiet compared to our dog or the busy road we live on and he was overall just a good rooster. We promptly got rid of him though. It’s been 2 years now and Jim still has his roosters. I still want one because I’d like to breed the rare ones I have to make some money on the side. I’ve talked to the other neighbors and none of them mind. It’s only Beth. I realize I would probably be the asshole but I do think she is overreacting, at least with my situation. Apparently she was even complaining to the town about how Jim had a few trucks in his yard that she could see. We all have 2 acres. It’s his back yard. She just seems to be a crotchety lady.

0,"AITA for offending a friend after she rejected help she asked for? | Hello! I'll try to be brief.

Friend (28F) let's call her *Jade* was spoiled financially from age 12 to 18 by father and developed habits of eating out, eating premade stuff, never cooked, best brands of candy every day. At 18 dad cut her off (he and the mother are divorced), and now for past 10 years she's struggling with meeting ends working part time jobs. This year it hit really hard since her government-welfare ended. Now, she, her mom, and her brother (18M) are living from mom's 300 eur salary. Jade by being really picky with food is actually starving. She claims that she needs about 7 euros per meal that she would eat. She refuses to cook and now, they don't even have a stove to cook on, just microvawe.

Me (24F) I grew up in a bit more financially responsible family and we barely eat out, we cook at home and usually bring meals to work, ect. Despite meeting ends well, I manage to make a ""price"" of meal about 2-3 euros. It is simple but healthy food, usually rice or buckwheat + some meat, eggs, bread, vegetables. It doesn't even get that repetetive for me even though the meals do look absolutely basic. 

Well, Jade, being my friend for 11 years, has been opening up and complaining lately, a lot. She actually is starving. She said lack of chocolate drives her crazy, and that she barely eats anything at all because mother doesn't give her money to eat (and she doesn't like to eat what mom buys). She asked for help.

I offered dark chocolate since we have a lot at home. *Rejected.* I offered to cook to her rice, buckwheat, eggs, give her vegetables, fruit, bread. *Rejected.* I kept offering help and she said I'm offering her food that she ""doesn't like"" and if I want to help I should give her cash. I do want to help her, but not in cash, since she would spend it in 2 days what I could make food for 1 week with the same amount. I was offering healthy stuff that I eat myself, but it is not good enough to her. Well, I snapped and said ""let me know when poverty and starvation lowers your standards"". AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for being deliberately obtuse when my sister gets indirect about things? | My (half) sister and her husband both work 9-5 jobs on weekdays and try to have a weekly ""date night"" on Saturday night. They have a 4 year old daughter and a 2 year old son, and they often asked me to look after them, usually on date nights, and I'd be there for minimum 3 hours nearly every Saturday night.

Don't get me wrong, I love my niece and nephew, but they're little kids. They run around, put things in their mouths, injure themselves, and it's a hassle to mind both of them on my own, so at Christmas I explained that I have other commitments and can only do it when she really needs it, like both her and her husband being stuck at work with no one to pick them up or some sort of family emergency, but I can't be doing it for the sake of it, especially as I'm doing it for free.

Since then she'll say things like ""\[Husband\] and I had planned to go out on Saturday, shame we've got no one to watch the kids"" and I've responded ""yeah, shame about that"", or she'll ask me about my plans and I'll tell her and she'll say ""yeah, we really wanted to do that but we don't have a babysitter"" and I'll respond ""hope you find one"" and we've had a few other interactions along the same lines where she'll complain that she can't do something and I've responded in a similar way to the examples.

Earlier tonight she texted asking what I was doing and I said my boyfriend and I were going to the cinema. She said she and her husband had planned to do that tonight for date night but didn't have a babysitter. I replied ""that's too bad, hope you find someone"". She then sent me back a large text saying she can't believe how rude I'm being, that it's one thing to stop babysitting but it's another to go out of my way to be bitchy/passive aggressive about it, and she didn't mind me cutting back on babysitting but she did mind me catching an attitude and blatantly ignoring her asking for help.

1,"WIBTA if I started responding to this person's baby pictures with cat pictures? | One of my relatives just had their first grandchild. Ever since the baby was born, she has been texting a group of people (including me) baby pictures several times a week. I'm getting a little tired of it, if for no other reason than all the text alerts. (It's a group text, not a group chat, so I can't leave the conversation as easily). 

&#x200B;

Recently, another relative went in for life-threatening surgery, with her family keeping us updated with text alerts. After she came out of the (successful) surgery, the new grandma replied with another baby picture, stating ""Baby is so happy for her! in her adorable new outfit, too!"" Immediately, the text chain split, with half trying to get updates on the surgery, and the other half confirming that, yes, the outfit was adorable. 

&#x200B;

The new grandma's texting has been a little annoying, but her (apparent) grab for attention from the surgery feels just plain trashy. However, I don't want to directly call her out, given that all my family is on the group text. My wife and I were talking, however, and we had an idea:

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I responded to the new grandma's future baby texts with pictures of our cat? Not ""our cat is cuter than your baby,"" but just ""look at how cute she is?"" I'm hoping that she'll get annoyed enough with me that she'll cut me out of future texts, or, in an ideal dream-world, realize that unsolicited baby pictures aren't all they cracked up to be.

1,"WIBTA for NOT postponing a talk with my son's father and his fiancee? They just had a baby. | I am no longer with my son's dad (referred to as Josh). He is heavily involved with my son and we split custody 50/50, so I won't claim he's a bad dad. He's just not easy to get along with and is **very** controlling.

I moved out almost two years ago and we made a verbal custody agreement; he offered to pay a small amount of child support each month. We do a decent job of working out kinks with scheduling with little push back from the other. I thought if we were only co-parenting that things might improve, and they did slightly. There was no longer daily opportunity for emotional abuse, but I still deal with depression as a result of the relationship.

About a year ago he started dating a new woman (referred to as Amy). A few months later she was pregnant. She's nice, she's stuck up for me to random people who have tried to talk negatively about me, and she's great with my son. A month ago they got engaged. At that point I asked Josh if the three of us could sit down and have a talk.

Even though I get along with Amy, Josh continues to make things tough. I work two jobs and have tried to pick up extra shifts here and there. Any time I ask if they can watch our son for a few hours I'm met with irritation and negativity from Josh. At one point she texted me offering to help whenever she can. I have asked her twice if she would mind watching him fora few hours, one of which I ended up picking him up early. Both times Josh has accused me of taking advantage of her offer.

Josh also continues to treat me poorly. If I make a minor mistake like being a few minutes late to pick up our son after work, I am treated like garbage. If I try to calmly discuss something with him or bring up a concern, it devolves into an argument. He takes advantage of our custody arrangement to call into work and party. I have up until now given in to most of his requests for the sole purpose trying to get along but he makes it difficult.

I wanted to sit down and talk with both of them regarding this and regarding Amy's role in our son's life. Josh told me that regardless what we talked about as a group, everything was essentially ***his*** **decision** and no one else's. He told me he does not want me contacting Amy outside of him.

I believe that if Amy is agreeing to marry Josh, she should get a say in some of these discussions. She is permanent fixture in my son's life by way of being the mother to his brother. She will have some authority and I believe she should be able to be present for co-parenting talks.

We have rescheduled this conversation once already, and we have agreed to sit down on Sunday afternoon. Amy ended up being induced a few weeks early and they had their son last night, and I believe Josh is expecting  to postpone again. Would I be the asshole for having this conversation with them in the first place and refusing to postpone after they have had their baby?",False,False
1,"AITA for asking my parents for a few thousand dollars because they said I could have anything I wanted as a graduation gift? | I, 17F, am graduating in a month, along with my twin brother. Last week, our parents said we could have anything we wanted as a graduation gift because we’re such great kids. We both got into prestigious universities. We’re not wealthy, but we’re comfortably upper-middle class. My brother and I never worked before because our parents encouraged us to focus on school and do extracurricular activities. We each have about $10000 in the bank from saving our allowances and holiday money. Our parents encourage us to save that money. They’re paying for our tuition and rent in full. I’m really appreciative of that, but I will be getting a part-time job when I start university. 


A few days ago, my brother asked for a used car. That went well with our parents. He would most likely be heading off to LA for university so a car would be practical. I have already decided to go to university in NYC, so I don’t need a car yet. I have really wanted a boob job for about a year now. No one besides my closest friends know that. I don’t think it would go well with my family if I tell them that. My mom and brother have joked a few times about people who get plastic surgery and I don’t want to be a target. I think I remember some of my relatives making fun of plastic surgery too. 


I’ve been thinking hard about what I should choose as a graduation gift these past few days. My mom kept asking me. A quality boob job costs about $10000 and I don’t want to be using all of my savings for that. I’m turning 18 in June, so I won’t be needing parental approval for a boob job either. I just want some extra funds to support it. I’m guessing my brother’s used car would cost around $5000, so today when my mom asked me if I had made up my mind on what I wanted, I told her that I really can’t choose and just please give me however much money they’ll pay for my brother’s car so we’re even. She said that’s not how it works and she wants to make this extra special for us, so I had to choose a gift that’s not just money. 


I’m still not comfortable telling anyone in the family that I want a boob job and intend to get one this summer. I told my mom that I really don’t know what I wanted that would cost a few thousand dollars, and since I don’t need a car for NYC, I really would appreciate some extra savings. She said I already have more than enough money given that they’ll pay for my university expenses and that if there are no gifts that I want that cost thousands of dollars, I could stop being so spoiled and just choose a gift I need that costs a few hundred dollars to save their money. I said I was sorry and to give me a few more days to think. She said I need to be more appreciative like my brother. I said I do appreciate all they have done for us. My mom doesn’t seem pleased with me. I don’t see what’s the big issue with asking for money instead of a non-money gift.",False,False
0,"AITA because I was ""invasive"" by moving someone's already done laundry out of the way? | This isn't a major deal, but after I did this a girl called me out on it. I don't know if she is justified or not. If she is then I'll gladly do things differently next time.

Currently, I live in a dormitory at my college and for whatever reason the laundry room's dryers were all packed with hardly any washers being used compared. So I was like, ""Okay, the dryers will definitely free up by time my clothes are washed."" I go back to get my laundry out of the washer and put it in the dryer. Somehow though, the dryers were all still full of stuff despite many of them having been done. I left for \~15 minutes to come back to hope some are free. There were still none free once I came back. I waited there for another 10 minutes, hoping that someone would come to pick up their clothes out of the dryer. At this point, there at least 4 other people there waiting with me as well to just throw their clothes into a dryer. 

I decided to simply move someone's laundry out of the way and place it on top of the dryer because I feel after 30 minutes you should be getting your clothes out of a public laundry room. I found one with the least amount of clothes in it then I started to move those clothes out of the way. This girl, who also happened to be waiting for a dryer, told me that I shouldn't do that, it was invasive and kind of creepy to have someone else touch your laundry. Maybe because this happened to be a girl's laundry? Only noticed after I moved a few things out; I didn't really care who's it was. I shrugged off her comment and just moved mystery girl's crap out of the way to dry mine. 

Basically, was I being ""invasive"" or an asshole in any way for how I handled that?",False,False
0,"AITA for suggesting my wife is using her postpartum depression as an excuse to be hurtfull/rude? | A bit of background first. My wife and I have been together for 6+ years (married for 3). Last August, she gave birth to our first, a beautiful son. Complications during the delivery forced her to have a C-section after 48 hour in labor and 3 1/2 hours of pushing. She was deeply angered and saddened by this, as she wanted to deliver as naturally as possible and his birth was anything but. 

After I returned to work, she began to spiral into a deep depression, refusing to leave the house, snapping at the littlest things, and not helping with our son after I got home from work (or helping very little). We were in a financial situation where she could afford to stay home and take care of our baby. While this was good in some ways, it also made her postpartum worse. She would go in between picking fights with family members, to kicking me and the baby out of the house for hours on end, to locking herself in the bathroom and taking long, tear-filled showers. 

She has since seen multiple therapists, been put on medication, and has vastly improved in so many ways since then. The problem is, her attitude has remained the same. I feel that she has become bitter, irritable, and developed a very short fuze, completely changing her personality from before our son was born. I have tried talking to her about this, but she always blames it on her postpartum and refuses to engage in any type of conversation without defaulting to shouting/personal attacks. 

I don't know what to do. I still love her more than words can express and I don't want to leave her. I have been up literally every single night with the baby so she can sleep uninterrupted, worked extra hours at work to keep a roof over our heads and our stomachs full, and tried to be as supportive and understanding as possible. But the lack of sleep, financial stress, working 11+ hours a day 6 days a week has made it difficult for us to connect and talk.

0,"AITA for taking a cheeky jab at the family size during a family conversation? | Some of the family conversations we have in our large family can sometimes be weird. My family consists of mum and dad, 3 boys (13M, 16M, 20M) and 3 girls (8F, 14F, 17F). I'm the 13 year old boy.

I love my family and all but obviously living with a large family, especially if you're one of the youngest, means that you aren't as free as you'd want to be, you're constantly nagged and bossed around by almost everyone, there's a LOT of noise and it's super hectic, but in the end everything is all done out of love and care and we respect each other. At least that's how it is with my family to give you an idea.

So moving on to this conversation of ours, my mum likes to come up with these sort of love questions that everyone doesn't really like to part-take in (everyone apart from me and 8F have partners, so we're pretty much safe).

""How many children would you like to have when you're older?"" Everyone was saying numbers between 4-5 and when the question came to me, I just said 1 or 2. And with a grin I added ""I like my peace and quiet, yeah."" My siblings seemed to get the cheeky jab at the family size I made, which made them laugh but my mum is very traditional so she likes having as much grandchildren as possible. She wasn't as smiley for the rest of the family conversation and I ruined the mood.

My roommates said they saw a kid, maybe 13 years old walk his dog on our yard. I saw the kid once myself and I asked him not to, pointing out the ruined flowers, and giving him directions to a dog park around the corner. 

Well, it happened again. I warned him again. The third time it happened (while I was in the yard, it happened more often) I was spraying the flowers with a hose, and without really thinking it though I sprayed the kid too. 

I figured that probably makes me an asshole, but I'd rather know for sure. If it matters it was 40 degrees so he would have dried up within minutes, and I hit the front of his shirt, so I didn't ruin his phone or anything. (I figured that would make me even more of an asshole.)

(Sidenote: 40 degrees Celsius is 104 degrees Fahrenheit, we aren't used to this weather at all, I don't think he should have been walking the dog on the pavement anyways in that heat but I'm not sure.)

Before we get into my potential assholery, some background: I [25M] have a niece who is 6 years old. My older sister [30F] was not in a good place when she had her daughter. Namely she had a severe drinking problem and was heavily involved with a lot of drugs and just some very sketchy people. To avoid my niece being put into the care system after several CPS visits, I took her in shortly before her first birthday. Eventually, my sister gave herself a shake, got her life back on track and got my niece back fulltime two years ago, though she still spends a lot of time with me as my sister is now an ambulance dispatcher so works funny shifts sometimes. My niece is absolutely the apple of my eye and I love her more than anything. Since I raised her for basically the first four years of her life, she and I have always hung out on Father's Day. I'm not arsed about getting gifts or anything like that, but I'll ususally take her to the aquarium or to see a film or something and just spend the day with her. 

So here's the situation. This year, no real plans were made for Father's Day but I'd mentioned in passing about my sister just dropping my niece in with me whenever and she said alright. She was a no show. I tried calling her a bunch of times, to no avail. Eventually, she calls me back at about 10pm last night saying she's sorry she missed me but she'd been super busy. I said it's fine and asked what she'd been up to, and she told me she'd taken a ""Father's Day daytrip"" down to London with her new man (of around 6months) and my niece, our brother and his wife and kids and our parents. I asked how come I wasn't invited and she said because it was a Father's Day thing and I'm not a father. I got a little irritated then and pointed out that I always hang out with my niece on Father's Day, and that it's kinda important to me because I took care of her for four years. My sister shot back saying it's not ""Uncle's Day"" and that she has a stepfather to spend Father's Day with now. I got kinda huffy and ended the call. Later got a text from my brother telling me I'm being a weird entitled tosspot and that if I want to celebrate Father's Day I should have my own kids, and a slightly kinder one from mum saying she's sorry I felt left out but this was a ""dads trip."" 

Idk. I just feel kinda miffed that I've essentially been pushed aside for a man who's been in her life for six months. I'm not like supremely angry or anything and I'll get over it, I just don't think I'm being entitled by expecting to at least be informed of what's going on on a day that's usually my day. Am I being an arse here or what?",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my girlfriend that she shouldn’t get a boob job. | My girlfriend is 20, I’m 23. We’ve been dating 3 years. She is absolutely gorgeous, very tall and skinny. She’s currently a 34B in terms of boob size and I think that’s just perfect. 

However she thinks they are too small. She has savings from work and wants to get silicone implants. She wants to be a 34C or D. I think thats too drastic and have advised her against it, especially since she’s so young. Plus I read that if you get implants it might mess with breastfeeding in later life.

Today I woke up at 4am with the sound of someone banging at the gate of my property, I found it weird and waited for it to pass but the noise got louder so I went to check. It was my next door neighbor asking if I could jump over the wall of her property and unlock the gate for her because she forgot to take her keys with her. At this point I told her that I would help her but also, it was at this point that I might have been an asshole. She thanked me and proceeded to say that she was avoiding to call her mom that was inside the house because it would wake up her kids and she didn't want to deal with that. So I asked her if she had tried to contact her mother in any way before she came to ask me for help, she said no and said once again it would be too much trouble. I was 100% ready to help her before because in my mind I thought she was completely stranded outside but once she revealed this piece of information I told her to try her mom because there were cleary better options than making me climb over a wall so she could get in. This set her off and she said that I was being a bad neighbor and I had no regards for her well being, so I told her I would wait with her while she called her mother but she denied it and walked away. I still stayed at my gate and I watched her make the call and then her mother opened the gate for her.

On our anniversary celebration, the subject of money somehow came up and my wife asked me how much was my monthly salary. I told her that nobody actually knows except my father and I wasn't really comfortable telling anyone else. I asked her if she needed something? she told me that she was just curious but she was upset that I told my dad and not her. 

The only reason I wouldn't really tell her is because that she's the kind of person who like to spend money on vacations and parties.

1,"AITA for telling my boyfriend it’s bed time when he’s video calling his sisters? | Boyfriend and I started studying in a country abroad almost a year ago. Since it’s the same city, we decided to move in and live together. We always sleep at the same time at 12-1am so we can wake up early.

I usually video call my parents once a week for around an hour. It’s like a 7 hour difference between our home country and this city. Sometimes they forget the time difference and want to video call when it’s 12am+ here and the afternoon there, so I tell them it’s late already and boyfriend and I are about to sleep so we could video call tomorrow.

Two days before my boyfriend video called his mother and I chatted with her for a bit too. Boyfriend then said he would call his sister the next day. Well next day comes and he doesn’t video call her until it was 10:30pm. I thought their conversation would last around an hour as usual but it was 12:30am and they kept talking. So I told my boyfriend it was bed time. He wanted to keep talking so I said he could sleep in the living room and I’d go to bed without him.

We live in a studio apartment so from the bed I can see the light from the living room and I can’t really sleep with the lights on so I asked him to turn them off. I thought he could just talked with his sisters without video. Boyfriend refused and got angry that I was saying all these stuff (bed time, him sleeping in the living room, turning off the lights) out loud for his sisters to hear and that I was embarrassing him. I kinda got a bit angry too because he wasn’t respecting my bed time so I turned off the lights myself. He got even more angry and I told him to please be considered and he should have called his sisters earlier instead of too late.

After that I went to bed and minutes later he came to me and told me he would never embarrass me and that he doesn’t want to talk to me now. I don’t really understand how that was embarrassing? It’s morning and he isn’t talking to me. He’s sending me memes on messenger though...

1,"AITA for requesting that my partner use correct grammar and punctuation when communicating with people we know from work in a social manner? | My partner and I both work in publishing, and good communication is a foundation of our relationship, literally. We both have jobs wherein we spend most of our time working with precise wording and efficient language. She's joked that I sound like a serial killer because all my texts are in complete sentences, with punctuation and capitalization and the like. She's far more casual with texts and other written communication, at least when sent to me. 

In light of recent events and the entire industry being shut indoors, we've been talking with our work colleagues a lot more just to stay sane and social. I'd say there's a 50/50 split in how people are treating this as ""work"" related email and whether we're chatting with friends... I take the former interpretation. 

Today I asked my partner to please use proper grammar, punctuation and typography when talking with our work friends. She thought I was joking, and then said I was being controlling. 

I told her that it's the written equivalent of showing up to an after-work party in sweats and a t-shirt; that these are our peers in the industry, our reputation is based on our knowledge of the written word *and* that we're not in an industry where poorly written communication is excused, like in programming.

0,"AITA for shaming my sister to her face for not flushing the toilet? | Just about every morning after I wake up, I head to the bathroom to shower, brush my teeth, etc. and discover that the toilet is full of crap. It's not fresh, it's clearly been sitting in the bowl overnight. This occurrence is not limited to just mornings though. Only a few minutes ago I took a quick bathroom break from watching TV with my parents and when I lifted the lid, sure enough, the bowl was full. I had to hold my breath and flush before I could even go to the bathroom myself.

Some context: I'm 24 and on winter break from college. My sister is 21 and getting ready to head back to college after a semester off. This problem has persisted for at least the past 5-7 years. I thought it was just a bad habit that she had gotten into when she was younger and that it would go away with age, but it continues to happen.

I have talked to my parents about it. I've talked to my sister about it. I've left notes in the bathroom. Still she does not flush the toilet. Ever. Lately I've resorted to making fun of her and talking about how disgusting it is right to her face and even around my parents in the hopes that it will get her fired up and maybe she'll change her ways.

Heres the more detailed parts: my parents divorced after I was 18, but my younger siblings were still minors. My sister had the hardest time accepting it, & still has a hard time dealing.

She got into some trouble with friends around May of 2018 (broke into the high school of our hometown) & my Dad gave her 2 options: stay with my mom, but lose her car, or come live with me, keep the car, & help me with my kiddos. (single parent) She, of course, chose to live with me (she couldn't lose her precious car)

She gets here in August, & everything is going swimmingly. After about 6 months, she stops going to school on time, she stops helping me around the house, & is doing the bare minimum on helping me with my kids. Mind you, this is all stuff she agreed to when she came. She would go to school, help me out, & be responsible. She's not anymore.

So, my Dad calls me today & asks where she is. I can't lie to him. He's my Dad. He asks me if BF is her guardian or if I am. I tell him I am, & he says then why isn't she home. It's a school night. She needs to be home at 9. (I truly thought it was 11) I say, ok, I'll call her. He informed me he already did, & he was giving her 20 minutes to be home, & if she wasn't, call him to tell him.

1,"AITA for not inviting my father to my wedding and not insisting my fiance to change the venue? I will be getting married at a temple where people belonging to other faiths aren't allowed inside. | This all might sound really weird and alien to the people of this sub reddit, but hear me out. 

I'm engaged to be married to my fiance, who comes from a royal Indian (Hindu) lineage. His great grandparents were from a princely state in Colonial India, during British rule. 

After India gained independence, the government abolished all princely titles, and the former Royal families became regular citizens. 

However, these families have retained their wealth and popular support and the people from their town still see them as their Royal family. In short, they are influential people. 

I didn't know about my fiance's background for years, and upon finding out, I even broke up with him because I was intimidated.

Anyway, So I'm half Indian, born to a British father and my Indian Hindu mother. They divorced when I was 5, and I primarily grew up with my mother. My mother married my stepdad when I was 8, and I had a very Hindu religious upbringing. 

I saw my father only a few times a year, but we had a good time together whenever we were together with his family. 

Now since my fiance belongs to a very religious Hindu family, I had to formally become a Hindu and get adopted by my stepdad as I am a non-hindu by birth. 

This was necessary because the temple where I would be getting married at, doesn't allow entry for non hindus. And the ceremony requires both the bride and the groom to be hindus. 

Now because I would be getting married at the temple, with only a select few family and friends present (They all have to be Hindu), it wouldn't make sense for me to invite my dad for the ceremony. 
And because my stepdad would be the one giving me away (there's a ritual where the father of the bride gives away the bride, known as kanyadaan), I just thought there was no point of inviting him. 

I will be inviting him for the reception though, which will be a party for extended family and friends. 

When my father asked me about the actual wedding, I told him why I couldn't invite him. He was furious about the fact that I let my stepdad adopt me for the ceremony. He also can't understand we had to get married at that specific temple, since other temples do allow for non hindus. 

But the thing is, that particular temple is the one my fiance's family follows, and my fiance's late grandfather wanted my fiance to get married there. 

He says that I'm the asshole for not insisting them on changing the wedding venue.

Am I?",False,False
1,"AITA for reporting my brother in law for telling my niblings (13 and 11) ""I don't care if you do cocaine or smoke pot""? | Some background is in order and I'm using a throwaway. I have history with my BIL that predates him dating and marrying my sister. In college he dated a good friend of mine and I was certain (still am) he was cheating on her so I told her and she dumped him. He lies about it to this day but needless to say we don't get along. When he started dating my sister I tried to warn her about him but she was so ""in love"" she refused to heed my warnings. They've been married for 18 years and I'm certain there's infidelity and abuse but I have no proof and my sister cuts me off when I bring it up. 

So to the crux of the issue. Two weeks ago I picked my nephew (11) up from baseball. I asked him how things were going and asked him if he had any issues he'd like to talk to me about. He said no so I asked if he'd been offered drugs. He sort of perked up and said no but that his dad said ""I don't care if you do cocaine or smoke pot."" 

I was livid so I stormed into their house and tried to discuss with my BIL. He said he was too busy to talk and asked if I was freaking out about ""nonsense"" again. I told him this was about what he said to my nephew. He said to stay out of he and his kids business and he wasn't even comfortable with me driving the kid and would talk to my sister about it. I stormed out and thought about what I should do. 

So the next morning I went directly to the kids principal and told her what I'd heard. She profusely thanked me and said she would address the issue. I was very happy that at least some sort off authority figure knew. 

Later in the day I got a text from niece saying ""Aunt Shana, what did you tell the principal?"" I told her that was adult stuff. She texted back ""My dad never said we should do drugs!"" I told her ""honey, let the adults handle this ok."" Her response was ""he told us that he doesn't care if we do drugs like smoke pot but he wants us to realize that if we do drugs, we have to get them from drug dealers who can be really awful people! Please take this back!"" I told her again that if that's what he said it's just as bad and she needed to let the adults handle this. I got a text from my sister later that night saying ""please leave my kids out of whatever your issue is today."" I told her ""I'm always here to talk about what is truly going on in your house."" 

Well fast forward to late last week and I guess my sister and BIL got a visit from our state's version of CPS. CPS called me, I told them the truth that I feel my BIL is abusive and an adulterer and the thing about the drugs. My sister called me later that day apoplectic at what I'd done, so did my parents and other siblings. Everyone is furious with me. I told my sister that I was always here for her if she ever wanted to talk about the abuse I know she receives from my BIL and she told me that she never wants to speak to my ""fat, ugly ass ever again"" and hung up.

1,"WIBTA for not telling my ex I'm pregnant? | So I appreciate this is a weird place to ask this but I'm really overwhelmed and everything is a mess right now and I just need a simple majority vote on whether I'd be an a-hole or not, so here goes nothing.

My boyfriend and I were a couple for 2 years, and moved in together after 18 months. Things were great up until we moved in together. He's a slob and has admitted that he only tidied his old flat when I was coming over, and once we were living together he stopped. He also stopped cooking and pretty much any chores, saying I'm better at them than he is, which pissed me off but I wound up doing them anyway. He also stopped making an effort in terms of personality/behavior and became significantly more snappy and temperamental than he was when we lived apart. He also made these friends who smoke weed (legal here) and while I made clear that any form of smoking (or vaping) is a deal-breaker for me (nan died of lung cancer), I found out he'd been smoking it with them. 3 days after that he told me that he quit his job, because his stoner friends had convinced him to pursue his lifelong dream of being a rock-star in a band with them, despite none of them being able to sing or play any instruments. That really drove it home for me that he wasn't someone I wanted to be with, and there was no future there.

I called my mum and told her everything, and she said that if I wanted to come home then I can. I sat him down, told him that I was breaking up with him, told him why, and he didn't take it well, asking for another chance, asking me to help him get his shit together, saying he'd un-quit his job and stop smoking. This was all about 2 weeks ago. I've been staying with my mum in this time and looking for a new place to live.

A week ago I found out I was pregnant. I had the coil for a while, and then the pill, but both gave me really bad side effects so our only birth control was condoms. I haven't booked a GP appointment yet but 7 different tests all said positive and I'm estimating that I'm around 3 months.

I don't think I should tell him. We talked about kids when we were together, but he always said he wants to do things ""properly"", as in propose, get married, then have kids, and doesn't want to do it any other way. His parents divorced when he was a kid and split custody and he's always said he'd never do that to his child. Between the complete lack of effort in terms of housework, the smoking, quitting his job, and his views on split parenting, I don't think he's ready to have kids, or in a place where he'd be a good dad. Maybe finding out I'm pregnant would snap him out of it, but I've got no clue what's going on with him right now, all I know is I ended things for a reason, and those same reasons apply to just about everything else.

0,"AITA for leaving a one star review and keeping my money? | So to give a little bit of background my AC stopped working on a Sunday. I called a local business that had good reviews (several hundred reviews). They said it would be extra to come out on the weekend so I asked if they could come out on Monday. I figured I could suck it up for a day. They make the appointment and tell me it will be $40 for them to come out. 

The next day rolls around and I leave work a bit early to be home for the 4:00 service call. I wait and wait, but it gets to be 5:00 and no one is there. I call them and ask where the repair person is. Apparently I was never put into the system. They apologize and agree to get someone out ASAP that day. They tell me it’s going to be $75 for the service call. I explain that I was told $40 on Sunday. She says that they did have a discount but you had to mention when you called. She eventually agrees to go with the price I was originally told and was very nice about it saying, “if you were told $40 that’s what we’ll charge.”

The repair guy shows up and he fiddled around for about 10 minutes and then comes and says to me that he’s done all he can for $40 and if I want anything else done it’s a $150 diagnostic charge. Well I’m stuck in a 89 degree house and it’s too late to call anyone else so I say “sure whatever”. He spends a few more minutes and discovers a loose wire. He fixes the loose wire in about 5-10 minutes comes down out of my attic and tells me it will be $300 total. So to recap it was $40 for the service call, $150 for the diagnosis, and $110 for him to strip and reattach a wire. I was never told about the $150 diagnostic charge when I called them to come out. Well I pay because I’m burning up and he’s not the guy to take this up with anyway. I leave a one star review on their business explaining all of this. Well a week later their business replies saying they’re reversing my charge and giving a full refund. I didn’t necessarily want a full refund. I would have been happy paying about 180-200 for the work. I know I’m paying for his expertise not the speed  or ease of the repair. I just felt it was predatory that I wasn’t told upfront about the $159 diagnostic charge.  I feel kind of bad keeping the refund but they gave it to me and my dad says I should just keep it. 

So AITA leaving my review up and just keeping the full refund? I’m going to go and reply to them thanking them for it and explain that I wish they had been upfront about all potential charges, but I’m not going to change my review because other people should know and people usually check the one star section.

I did not know how old this guy was until recently when she sent me screenshots of her messages with him on Instagram and he blatantly asked her out because he “liked her for awhile” and “thinks she’s pretty.” She said she only ever thought of him as a friend but could see a possibility of being with him if he were closer to her age. He said that maybe she’d be lucky enough to get a kiss from him. I found it quite disturbing and since the age gap was mentioned in the messages, I asked her exactly how much older he was compared to her. 

Looking out for her, I told her that it seems a little immature of him to hit on someone five years younger than him and that it sparks a red flag, especially since they’re both at completely different stages in life. She told me to not ruin this high for her and that he’s “pretty” and that I should stay out of her business.

As a result, she held up the security line for a long time.

I suggested that she step aside and let other travelers through and my suggestion was met with a few cheers. 

She seemed really embarrassed but didn’t apologize at all. After I passed the screen I mentioned to the TSA agent he should manage the queue better.

1,"AITA for insisting my possibly anorexic cousin to eat a slice of pizza? | My grandma lives with my mom. It was my grandma’s 80th birthday yesterday so many of my relatives gathered at my mom’s house to celebrate the occasion. I (23M) was at my mom’s house all day to hang out with my brother (18M). My mom told me to buy pizzas for everyone for when they’ll arrive in the evening. I bought 5 large Round Table pizzas, 1 vegetarian for the 2 pescatarians in the family and 4 supremes, of which one was cheese-less for my lactose intolerant brother. 


My uncle, 2 aunts, and 4 cousins came over, of which one of them, Marika (20F), would be at odds with me later. I don’t follow her life closely. The last time I saw her was over half a year ago. She was always fairly skinny, but not deathly skinny. I’d say she was always around 5’6” 115 lbs and ate a normal amount of food, including meat. This time she looked very emaciated and looks to only weigh around 105 lbs give or take. The only meat on her bones are her fake boobs that weren’t there the last time I saw her. She doesn’t look like the fit-skinny type of girl you see at the gym. She looks like she can’t even cradle 5 boxes of pizza. 


I know better than to give unprovoked negative comments. However, while we were all in the backyard eating pizza, Marika was the only one who wasn’t eating any. When my mom asked her why not, she said that she’s not hungry. It seems like her parents aren’t concerned about her health. No one in our family besides my grandma is fat, but no one is as skinny as Marika is now either. I’m a relatively fit person at 6’1” 180 lbs. I’m slightly concerned that Marika has a possible eating disorder. 


I told her that she should have some of my brother’s pizza since it doesn’t have cheese so it has fewer calories. She said that she’s really not hungry. I asked her what she ate for lunch. She said she had guacamole on toast for brunch. I said that doesn’t sound very filling so she should have a slice of pizza. I also said that she looks to have lost a lot of weight and it concerns me. My mom and grandma said they agree and that she should eat more. Again, she said she eats a normal amount and when she’s hungry. I told her that she should at least eat a slice with everyone and that a slice is only about 300 calories and a girl her size can eat 1500 calories and not gain weight. 


She yelled at me to stop being so fucking annoying and pressuring her to eat when she just isn’t hungry. I said I’m just concerned for her. She said she’s sick of people like me who keep making a big deal out of how she eats. Her mom apologized for her and thanked me for worrying about her health, but that Marika can handle herself well. I said that’s great and that was pretty much the end of that discussion. Marika seemed kind of cranky, especially with me. She was on her phone nearly the whole time while the rest of us caught up. She’s not usually like that and wasn’t like that before her eating habits were brought up.",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I suggested therapy for my creepy, bone-collecting niece | She's 5 and the creepiest person I've ever met. For starters, the questions she asks are off the wall. She once asked me if she could feel my skin to make sure I was warm and living and how many buckets of blood I thought were inside a cow. Those are just two of the recent ones. When she's not asking questions, she's staring into the distance (or occasionally straight into your eyes) with a blank look on her face. She's an intelligent, precocious child and sometimes when I'm around her I feel like I'm in the movie Orphan (SPOILER: full grown woman in little girls' body). She's articulate for her age and her parents say it's because she reads so much. She's in 1st grade (skipped Kindergarten) and has already read all the Harry Potter books. Even so, I feel like she knows way more than possible for someone so young. She's never shown any aggression or violence toward anyone, but I feel like she's not normal. I once saw her picking hairs off a family member's jacket and putting them in a little plastic baggy. This girl has a mason jar full of CHICKEN BONES on her night stand. I'm not making this up. Every time her family eats a rotisserie chicken, she picks out the bones she ""likes"" and puts them in the jar. I am 19 years old and terrified of a this small child. I get uneasy even going to their house because I'm afraid I'll see her in the corner counting her little bird bones. WIBTA if I suggested my brother take her to therapy?

Over the years though, I've been getting progressive and hold progressive views including matters on lgbtq+ that other Christians probably don't. My girlfriend of 1 year also holds these progressive views. Last week, she asked if she could come to church with me and my family. I said sure, and we all went this sunday.

We didn't go to the main sermon, but the side one held for teens/young adults and the topic was on gay people. Long story short, there were tones of disappointment and looking down on gays from the pastor and people listening to the sermon and after we got home, my gf was pretty pissed. Said church members were trash and cursing them out and told me to never go there again. I told her I was sorry but I still believed in god and wanted to go and she got angry.

I got on the bus yesterday morning and after a few stops it got cramped. A woman and her child sat next to me, with the child inbetween us. The child kept coughing and sneezing the whole time, with his mother occasionally pulling out a wipe for his nose. 

I was getting livid because the child, who looked to be 5 or 6 years old, never once covered his mouth, his mom never once told him to do so either. So as a result, sometimes if he was looking in my direction, he'd cough and sneeze. 

As we were approaching my stop, I finally decided to say something and told her ""can you tell your brat to cover his mouth?"" She told me to back off and shot me a glare. I was getting up anyway to get off and told her ""you are the reason outbreaks happen.""

There was some general yelling between us as I was walking to the front, with her threatening to call the cops and me telling her she should have gotten an abortion for her shitty child.

Understandably I realize on some level it was wrong to argument with her, but people's lives are at risks and I think it's incredibly irresponsible to not call out people who don't take safety precautions.

My friend, who is not a vegetarian and has never gone meatless for more than a few days or weeks, randomly said one day that people who est simulated meat (I.e. plant based bacon, beyond meat burgers, tofurky etc) are fake vegetarians and shouldn't be allowed to call themselves vegetarian becuase its basically the same as eating meat. I was kind of upset by this, as I eat those things. It's hard for me to eat beans due to texture issues, so I need them for protein. And I just like how they taste.  I also like the taste of meat, just not the concept of eating an animal. 

I told her she was being rude seeing as she isnt even a vegetarian, and then I admittedly wasnt super nice and raised my voice when I told her why I disagree. She stated it as a fact, that I shouldn't be allowed to call myself vegetarian when I eat simulated meat.  She then, the next day, called me an asshole for ""telling her her opinion was wrong"" when all I really did was say that she didnt really have ground to stand on.

I(20F) was in the park with my BF(22M) when a woman with children came sitting close to us. 

My BF was looking in her general direction (he was looking at a couple of kids playing football beside her). He then turned to me and we started talking about game of thrones. 

She suddenly turned to us and asked us if anything was wrong. My bf said no in a confused manner, considering we werent looking at her. She kept saying ""what was wrong?"" In an increasingly aggresive manner. She apparently thought we were gossiping about her and her kids.

So I stepped in and told her we were not talking about her and that i couldnt care less about her kids. She then got more angry and told us that we shouldnt be gossiping because its a sin in our religion (we were all muslim in this situation).

I told her in a very aggressive voice that she's irritating us and that religion has nothing to do with this and that she should focus on her kids instead of us. She kept looking and I eventually told her to fuck off.

So she wants me to help her do the landscaping over several weekends as well as paint and tidy up the shed to use as a garage for her new car. I've refused to help on this DIY project because: 

a) money is already tight around and she has to take out loans for something that has no practical value so I disagree with her buying the car in the first place. Ultimately it's her money and I have no say

b) I'm in my final year of high school and I'm really focusing on my grades to get into a good university (which she agrees). if I have to help her with this it would make me even more angry at her during those weekends and when I'm emotionally stressed it is impossible for me to do anything productive in the time I have left.

c) if this were an actual chore (eg. Mowing the lawn, clearing out the gutter...)

1,"AITA for shoveling snowy driveway and depositing it on roommate’s car | Let me preface first with backstory before the straightforward title indicating to how I’m probably an asshole misleads you.

So yes, I did dump a rather large amount of snow on my roommate’s car somewhat recently. We live in Colorado and had gotten 19 inches of snow and I came home at 2AM from work unable to get into my driveway as it had snowed all day while I was not home. Our driveway is an L-shape that has us wrap around the house and park in the back so it’s a bit long. And this process took me roughly 2.5 hours. I did a thorough job clearing the back area but towards the end I hated taking each scoop all the way back out to the street so I had to find an alternative spot to stash the snow. That spot being on and around the vehicle of the roommate who had been home all day long and was asked by me prior in the day if he could assist with the shoveling before I got home by doing a portion of the drive. 

[here’s photo evidence of the snow shoveling deed](https://imgur.com/a/rFGWNhU)

But there’s more to this story. This was a bit out of character for me but I did feel justified as the roommate is basically a bum. My previous roommate and good friend, had gotten engaged and moved in with this fiancée so he subleased his remaining lease term to a random Craigslist guy now roommate, who ended up becoming the biggest pain in my ass. He is late on last two months rent (his share) which our landlord is giving him a few more weeks to figure something out or else she’s coming to me for restitution pay. He doesn’t have a job. He doesn’t look for a job. His only source of income is donating and plasma as often as he’s allowed. He uses my restroom to take shits when I’m not there (came home once and caught him having just finished the act). He eats my food. And he like compulsively sings random songs and in dad-joke fashion changes the chorus to be filled with dreadful puns. Even my dog hates this guy. 

So I took out my frustration by sending a subtle message. He was awake the whole time, he could’ve come outside to even offer help. The one thing I didn’t foresee was that his car wasn’t able to start the next morning until he cleared the snow and got it jumped. Ironically he missed his appointment to donate plasma. So I’m curious, despite the trauma endured by living under the same roof as this guy and him not helping me, am I the asshole?

She's always had a history of asking for favors like covering her for a couple of hours for her kid's school things or if the kid gets sick or has no one to watch her. Also a history of calling off last minute for the same reasons. She is super over protective of her kid and even when she has people to watch her she is super picky about it. The kid is 9. 


Last year my friend got pregnant and it was the same thing, constant appointments, the kid is sick, school functions, ect. I've been as understanding as I can be and have covered as much as I can but the times I've said no she will get pissed and not speak to me or throw a tantrum. 


When she took maternity leave, she was supposed to come back mid December. She didn't. She asked our manager for more time because the new baby was having too much colic and was still too fussy. Okay fine. Then when she came back two weeks later, she stayed for most of her shift but asked to leave 2 hours early because her sister (who was supposedly going to watch the baby now that she came back to work) called her and said the baby kept crying non-stop and to come get her. Later in the evening she told me she wouldn't come in the next day. 


The next day she sent me a doctor's note she was given for 15 more days off because the baby was colicky. I told my boss and he said to tell her she has those last 15 days to get her shit together and find appropriate child care or she will be replaced. 


Apparently she didn't take that seriously because she suggested I ask him if she can work one day a week for 2 more months so she won't lose her job.

Over the semester, we went from everyone contributing equally to Rachel contributing only within 30 minutes of the submission deadline (11:59pm) if she bothered to contribute at all. We're all in a group text, we all sent each other reminders & updates on when we got our parts done. She clearly received the texts as she would acknowledge them & reply.

Which brings us to the group project:

* Friday, April 19th: We organize our project document. David decides what part he'll work on.
* Saturday: I let everyone know that my part is done. Alex & David sign off on it.
* Sunday: Alex decides his part. Rachel asks what she should handle. I tell her what each of us is working on/what is left (there's only one option of what to work on).
* Monday: Rachel asks if she should do the activity diagrams. We say yes.
* Tuesday: David has his part done. Alex and I sign off on it. David suggests some helpful resources to Rachel who says she'll look. Later, we give Rachel suggestions & we say we'd like it done by 2-3pm Thursday. We specify this because in previous weeks we've had to turn in a few assignments late because she hasn't contributed until the day after they're due.
* Thursday: Alex finishes his part. Rachel tells us she's added the activity diagram. Clearly stated in the instructions were that there should be at least 2. We take a look. It's about a railway ticketing system (nothing to do with our topic) & something about the weird image pixelation of it just gave me a feeling. I image search and find out it's straight up plagiarized from a website. David walks her through the instructions again. We tell her to let us know if she needs help. We give her the deadline to have it done by the next morning. If she doesn't, David and I will do the diagrams.

Friday, April 25th: At 10:00am, we tell Rachel we're going to submit at 12. She says okay. At 12, David & I add our diagrams, take her name off the project & submit it without her. We tell her. At 12:40, she says she has it done (again, only one diagram) & when she puts it on the document it's not even the right type of diagram. She says she doesn't care that we've submitted, she's going to put her name back on it with her wrong diagram, and resubmit it for the group.

Nanny is from another country so she lives with us. She goes back to her country like 4-5 weeks a year so she’s been with us most of our lives.

0,"AITA for kicking my friend and his girlfriend out of my party, because she was too young? (19) | 
I just bought a house and threw a housewarming party, inviting a bunch of friends. All in their late 20s or early 30s. I made a Facebook event and since I wanted to be clear it was a party-party, not a family event, I put this in the description:

""Drinking age only please; and I don't mean apple juice!! This is a big kids night, y'all! 😁""

(I'm in the US btw, where the legal drinking age is 21.)

So the party was pretty great in general, until something happened that's caused some drama in my friend group.

My friend Jack from my hiking club, who I'm not super close to, but I'm friendly enough with, brought a girl he was dating. She looked a little young for him but I didn't say anything at first. 

Till I heard someone else say she was a college freshman. I asked Jack how old she was, and he said 19. I asked him what the hell he was doing, bringing someone underage for drinking to party at my house. 

He said that everyone parties at that age. He did, he knows I did, it's no big deal.

I said yeah but I still don't want to be the one serving someone alcohol illegally. I could be in trouble as the homeowner if something goes wrong. And honestly she was too young for me to be comfortable partying with. Yeah we all drank in college, and damn if that wasn't a bad idea sometimes. College kids can be messy at the best of times.

He got defensive, saying his girlfriend was mature, and it was insulting for me to act like she's a child. 

I reminded him about the Facebook invite... And he said that was obviously talking about little kids, what did I think he was, a cradle robber? 

I was getting frustrated and said ""Well you said it first"" which pissed him off, but he actually left after that. 

Afterwards, Jack and a couple of his friends texted me saying I went too far. Jack was mad I embarrassed his girlfriend by kicking her out because of age. And a few other guys he's buddies with said I needed to chill, drinking at that age is normal, the cops aren't going to come by and ID everyone at a relatively tame housewarming party.

So I don't know if I overreacted. After buying my house, I heard so many horror stories about homeowner liability. Like what you're liable for if someone gets hurt in your property, if someone is drinking underage there, etc. So it bothered me a lot that Jack would break my rule for the party that everyone had to be legal to drink.

0,"WIBTA if I ask my depressed husband to do more for the family? | Throwaway account for privacy. 

My husband is clinically depressed (diagnosed by his psychiatrist) and is on multiple medications for it along with anxiety and PTSD. He also has chronic pain issues that just make his other problems worse. I knew about this when we were dating, he got a lot worse for a while, but he is so much better than he was before his meds. 

My problem is that even with his meds, it's a struggle every day to get him to do more than the absolute bare minimum. He is a stay at home dad since he can't work right now and I could swear on a Bible that when I am at work, he starts the day in his armchair and doesn't leave it unless he has to get up for the bathroom, the baby, or to eat. He hardly ever does any sort of play with the older kids unless it's a video game that he can stay in his chair for, and he struggles even going outside because of his anxiety.

He will spend an entire day just sitting there playing games, or spacing out with youtube videos. When I am off work I immediately have to take care of the baby, our older kids, try to handle laundry dishes litter boxes etc. Sometimes he will have gotten trash out or cleaned up a little but never enough to make any difference. 

The thing is I know he doesn't want to be this way and isn't doing it to be lazy or mean. Some days that he is a little better he will take initiative for something. But I am just so tired of scrambling to do everything. I don't want to be a nag or hurt him because of this, but any time I try and talk to him about the state of the house he seems to retreat a bit and ends up needing extra care for a few days.

WIBTA if I tell him he needs to do more? I am just so tired and stressed and I feel like I am drowning. I'm even hurting my relationship with my older kids because I can't spend any time playing or hanging out.",False,False
1,"WIBTA for airing my circle of friends' dirty laundry after 6 years of silence? | My friends have been lying to each other about how they feel toward themselves for a long time now. Many use me as their confidant and tell me about their issues with one another and then return to our social gatherings as if nothing is wrong. After a while the unrest and infighting has grown to the point where we often don't see certain members of our circle as they need time to recover from associating with someone else.

When they had an issue with me, they made it public that they had an issue with me. I addressed their issues with me and adjusted how I carry myself so that they no longer have said issues. It has lead to them liking me more than how they like one another and some confiding in me.

6 years later, I have had enough of the infighting and made public to all of them the info they provided to me in a large diatribe calling each of them out on their bullshit. To which point all of them, including the confidants, did the equivalent of ""fuck you. You don't know me"" and blocked me.

So far, only one person, the friend I have known for the longest, has unblocked me apologizing for their reaction and they want to remain friends. They also want to rebuild the circle starting with me and another person we both trust.

My question is, Was I an asshole for airing their dirty laundry in the same way they did to me? If I used a softer handling, they would have swept it under the carpet with the 6 years of dust already under there. I understand that the truth hurts and lying is sometimes a safer option to keep friendships. But I refuse to lie to others because I'd rather have no friends than a bunch of fake ones.",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I told my sister to stop posting about her relationship status on social media for the sake of our brother? | I don't use social media much. I have social media mostly just to see what my family is up to.

I am the youngest out of three. I am more of an introvert, but I have dated around a fair bit since my teen years, but have been with my my current partner now almost 5 years.

My sister is older than me by about 7 years. She is an extrovert and social butterfly. Very obviously our parents' favorite and got spoiled a lot. She's not a brat, but has always had really high standards for everything in her life. This includes guys, so basically she's only ever dated one guy for like, 4 years, but they broke up 3 years ago. She's still friends with her ex though.

My brother is older than me by about 10 years and has very functional autism. He's capable of understanding and picking up on other's thoughts/emotions through their words and actions, but he struggles some and he worries about it. It gives him a lot of anxiety and he has no idea what to do when he thinks people are upset. He struggles also to express how he is feeling. He seemed perfectly content on being alone, but just under two weeks ago introduced his first ever girlfriend to the family. I haven't met her face-to-face yet, but if she makes my brother happy, I am sure she's awesome.

Since my brother told everyone about his new girlfriend, my sister's been posting a lot on social media about being single, having been dumped in the past, etc. It is so much to the point where my partner is asking if my sister is okay.

I get that my sister is probably going through something right now. She's now the single one out of the three of us. I wouldn't be surprised if people were now asking her when she was going to find someone. It was always presumed that my sister would be the first of us to get married/have kids. Hell, our mom always used to ""joke"" that my sister was her only hope to have grandkids (though that was mostly directed at me and my brother and I don't know if our mom actually ever said that to my sister).

It is very obvious to me that my sister is bothered by our brother having a girlfriend now. I don't know if it is because she's feeling alone/hurt, if she's jealous, or if people are saying things to her and she's not taking it well. I don't know if our brother has picked up on it or not but it wouldn't surprise me if he had, and was stressing about it internally. This should be a time where our brother is happy, not stressed or worried.

Would I be an asshole if I called or texted my sister telling her to stop posting about her break up that happened years ago for our brother's sake and suggest that she talk to someone privately or go to therapy or something?",False,False

They both flipped out saying that they have only helped us the entire pregnancy (they both only recently became involved, within the past 3 months.) I don't want anyone there right after he is born because my boyfriend and I want to bond with baby, have baby bond with us, get cleaned up and rested before people show up. Well both the mother and sister flipped out and the sister made a post on facebook about how I was ungrateful for everything they have done, that I am exactly like his ex wife, and that she won't be able to see the baby until Monday because she has to work all weekend.

I've been depressed for the better part of four years now, and a main reason why I'm not in therapy is because I know I can't afford it on my salary; I won't be on my parents insurance for that much longer; I think it's better to go without than to see it yanked away. I can obtain antidepressants for now but I do worry about what happens when I go off their insurance.

I'm never rude to customers and I get several positive surveys; but for that reason I almost never smile.

I feel like she has a right to know this information about herself and keeping it from her is not okay. I told my brother that if they weren't going to tell her, I would. He said I wasn't allowed to be around my niece anymore. I act more like a big sister to my niece than an aunt because of my age (I'm 18) and we spend a lot of time together.

She said she believes in the Tooth Fairy and she also mentioned the Easter Bunny and Santa as well. This is what she tells me, at least!

My husband is upset about the classmate trying to ruin this for our daughter and possibly the 4-year-old should he find out from his sister. Next Easter, he wants to leave an actual trail of rabbit pellets (aka poop) in the house instead of jelly beans or chocolate candy like some parents do. (We have friends who have rabbits so this is how my husband would obtain said pellets.) He said he would put them on the hardwood, which can easily be cleaned, instead of on the rugs or carpet.

I have been a vegetarian for ten years now and am pretty strict about it. I am not the preachy type and don't take issue with people eating meat with me, but I feel that paying for meat myself even if I don't consume it is morally wrong. I told this to my friend, and showed him a menu of pizzas with around half a dozen vegetarian options that all looked delicious. He however told me he wanted a chicken pizza, and that as we were ordering two anyway it should make no difference as he would just order a meat pizza with his own money if I refused to buy it for him. I suggested some alternative vegetarian dining options but he was insistent he wanted pizza.

In the end we did end up ordering two pizzas and he paid for his own. He was quite short with me and left soon after. I do feel a bit guilty but feel justified that I mean the correct moral decision, whereas a couple of our mutual friends say I was a major asshole. So AITA here?",False,False

What gets me the most mad about that is that why wouldn't he also think that I want a piece for MY lunch tomorrow as well, I am not a meal prepping service... He also has a bf which I also get along with great and have no problem with... but since we share our food, I get annoyed because he invites him over several times a week, makes me cook for them (literally a what are we having for dinner question every night), and then I usually have less leftover food for lunch the next day.

1,"AITA for asking my friend to stop romanticizing selling nude pictures? | Hello. I (18M) have a friend (20F) whom we will call R. R does TikToks occasionally, and has that typical e-girl style a lot of people have nowadays: she dresses all in black clothes, skirts, has pink short hair, has bangs, loves using chains, that kind of stuff. She has a reasonable amount of followers in her TikTok and Instagram accounts.

R recently made an account in onlyfans, a site where you can sell nudes of yourself. People pay a monthly fee IIRC and they can see your nudes. I see no problem in that itself.

However, I shall remind you of a little detail: R got her popularity mainly from TikTok. TikTok is majoritarily used by underaged teens, and R's fanbase is almost fully composed by teenaged girls who aren't even 18 yet.

The problem is that R is *always* promoting her onlyfans account. She made it some weeks ago and most of her stories on Instagram promote her onlyfans - not only that, she romanticizes it a lot. A example I can give you is a post she made saying something in the lines of ""selling packs ((we call them nude packs in my language, not sure if it's the same in english)) is great; you don't have to stop working even in the pandemics!""

Honestly that made it for me. I know that a lot of underaged girls want to sell nudes because they see other, legal people doing it. I contacted R and asked her to stop promoting her nude packs so much, and explained my reasonings. She told me that she wouldn't stop doing it, and I insisted. She got somewhat mad at me, saying that it wasn't her fault anyways, and blocked me. She unblocked me shortly afterwards but we haven't talked since.

He's never had tea, he mostly drinks water, never coke or anything (he's diabetic), because of that, he also never eats sweets of any kind. Thankfully, she puts sweet n low in it instead of sugar.

He took one sip and told her how sweet it tasted. He was worried about his diabetes, until she explained that she used a sugar substitute. I swear to you, he drank almost the whole pitcher. He fell in love with the tea. So he asked me to start making the stuff too. 

So, I did. I got some tea bags and made some. So, after it was ready, he came and got himself a big glass. But he spit it out because I didn't put any sweetener in it. I hold him he had to put it in himself.

So he did, but e complained it wasn't as good like that. After a few days, every pitcher I made, I didn't put the sweetener right in the pitcher. I could hear him grumbling every time he had to mix it in each glass. 

Then he got pissed off, he said "" i shouldn't have to fumbles around the messy kitchen to find the sweet n low every time I want tea, just because you're too lazy to put it in the pitcher.""

I told him its not because I was lazy, it was because you go through the sweet n low way faster if you do it like that. He said the tea is no good like that, you gotta put the sweetener in when its warm.

So, I got enough of him complaining. I made the tea right this time and he kept getting glass after glass, so much so that we ran out by the evening before dinner.

By dinner time, he asked me to make another pitcher. But unfortunately, I was out of sweet n low. We went through so much of it because he had to put 8 packets of it in the glasses of the tea I ""ruined"", to fix the flavor.

So, I've got 1 pack of sweet n low and tea that's almost brewed on the stove. I poured it up and put sugar in it. Like, actual, real, sugar.

I brought him his dinner and a glass of tea. He drank it and said it was delicious, it tasted way better. He asked if I didanything different. lied and told him it was Lipton, instead of store brand.

But, he kept going back and refilling his cup. So I just told him what happened. He didn't say thank you or anything. He started screaming at me. He kept saying ""You know I'm diabetic, why would you do that? are you trying to poison me?""

I suggested we go to Outback since I really enjoy it, its somewhat affordable and it was a quick drive from the shuttle parking lot. She said she would rather eat glass than eat at Outback. I asked her where she wanted to go so she suggested like an overly expensive, farm to table restaurant that was almost an hour drive away. It was already going on 8 and I was starving but it also meant that I wouldn't be at home until at least 11 with all the driving and I had an 8AM class this morning. I agreed to go but it was clear that even me suggesting Outback had killed whatever spark had been there.

1,"WIBTA for ending a two decade friendship with my best friend who won’t lend me money? | My “best friend” and I have been best friends for almost two decades, since sixth grade.

We pursued different careers after college. I had a 9-5 job while she continued her career as a model.

Being extremely attractive, she attracted a lot of suitors but only entertained those with money to burn. She has become a gold-digger, to say the least. She justifies this by saying that she’s a single mom (but that’s a different story).

Last year, I had a major emergency surgery and my insurance didn’t cover everything. I tried to borrow money from her as I had to use up my savings and I will be needing to some time to recuperate. Also, I know that she shops for luxury items almost every month and she always has rich sugar daddies who provide her money. She turned down my request. She said all her money are being managed by her parents so she can’t lend me money. I know it is not true as she confessed to me (way back before I attempted to borrow) that this is her standard alibi with others who try to borrow from her. 

This year, I had a series of unfortunate incidents and bad business decisions. I tried to borrow money from her again (nothing over $3000). At first, she was half-hearted. She said “maybe” and might agree if there’s a loan interest which I think is reasonable. In the end, she used the same reason she’s always used.

She knows that I rarely ask for help unless I badly need it. She knows that I always pay my debt. This time, I feel like she let me down when I badly needed help. Those were the only instances I tried to borrow money from her.

We’ve had our good days in the past and been through a lot of together but I feel like after all those years, she doesn’t trust me and she let me down. I also think that she’s too selfish knowing the fact that most of her money came from her gold-digging efforts.

1,"AITA for not paying for an equally extravagant wedding for my oldest daughter? | We have two daughters, Jody who is 26 and Hanna who is 28.

Both of them are engaged to two wonderful men who we adore.

My wife and I have saved roughly $50k for each daughter as a wedding fund. We aren't rich people so it took us years of being careful with our finances to help pay for half their college and this wedding fund.

We sat down with both my daughters separately to talk about their wedding plans. They did not know we had a fund for them. This was probably our first mistake.

Hanna immediately said she did not want a large wedding and would rather save money for a house deposit. She was going to do a courthouse wedding followed by a reception next year. So my wife and I agreed we would give her the wedding fund for that purpose. Again, we didn't communicate any of this with her. A huge mistake in hindsight.

Jody wanted a decent sized wedding. Something the fund would've covered.

My wife and I decided to pay for several of our family members from out of the country to attend. We knew it would be expensive but we knew we were only having one traditional wedding and we hadn't seen some close family close to 20 years.

Unfortunately, the costs started going out of control and we ended up taking $15K out of Hanna's wedding fund to cover the difference. At the time, we felt ok doing this because the extra costs of the wedding were due to our decisions, not Jody's.

The wedding happened a few weeks ago and it was perfect.

The problem now is that Hanna is aware we paid for most of her sister's wedding. She isn't aware about the costs and that we had to use some of her wedding fund.

A week after her sister's wedding, she came to us and said she changed her mind after seeing how beautiful it was. That she too wants a wedding like that with all of our extended family.

My wife and I had to tell her there was no way we could pay for all the extras again because we thought it'd be a once in a lifetime situation. We told her we'd be giving her around $35k for a house deposit and hosting her reception at our home.

Hanna had a complete meltdown and accused us of playing favorites. She left in tears.

She is now telling us she's too busy to meet for dinner or lunch when she used to drop by a few times a week.

This situation has now reached other members of our family who are chiming in.

This has been killing us. My wife told me we should just take the other $25k-30k from our savings to make this smooth over.

A part of me agrees but a larger part of me is angry that we have to mess with our retirement just because Hanna changed her mind. And I know part of her decision change is because of the constant competition our daughters have had growing up.

1,"AITA for declining offers of trips and events with my ex wife? | I basically live on student loans and my parents help pay my bills. I am hoping to graduate in two years. 

My son is 7 and I divorced his mom 4 years ago but we separated when he was 1.

We are in our 30’s and I pay child support of $450 a month. I see my son every Saturday for 5 hours although the visitation schedule gives me a lot more time. I’d try to see him more but between school and his activities it is hard. He is also very close with his mother and doesn’t like to stay with me overnight.

She got remarried a little over 2 and a half years ago. I don’t really know the guy. He seems okay. Like he has never been an asshole to me or my son. 

My ex is generally okay a lot of times although she gets real defensive about our son and will swing from nice and accommodating to downright mean when she thinks I am doing well by him. 

It bothers her I don’t take more time and she will demand it sometimes saying he needs his father to see him. 

She recently decided that a way to incorporate me more would be to invite me along to their things. When they go to a fun thing, my son calls and “invites” me. I wouldn’t mind going with just him but it feels awkward and forced if she goes along or if she offers to pays for it. 

I decline when they invite me to special events at the school that they are also planning to go to. She always says “ we will be there but we won’t hover. You can spend time with him but I will be there to scoop him up when you are ready to go or if he needs anything.” 

Her husband keeps saying we should grab a beer sometime. 

She recently invited me along with them on a big trip to a very large and famous theme park that would involve a hotel stay. She said I’d have to feed myself and pay for my incidentals but she would cover the hotel room since my son would want to sleep on my room and park admissions and flight. 

Apparently she is making plans for the trip and asked my son if his dad (me) would be interested in maybe going along. He got real excited and she told me she told him I might be busy with school and unable to go but we could ask. 

She again said they wouldn’t hover and we could take turns taking him to things instead of us all doing the parks together. 

She put me in a bad spot. I’d rather we all just go separately but I can’t afford it right now on my own so I told him he and I would go maybe in a few years. 

They would be on the flight. They would be lurking around. I’d have to see them together when I drop him off. It just bothers me. Like it isn’t natural to be close to your exes. I just don’t want to be a part of their family. 

A part of me thinks they want me to go so they can have some alone time together. She was upset last year I wouldn’t watch him during the week so they could take a trip. I couldn’t.

0,"AITA for telling our friends/family to back off with their concerns about my wife's pregnancy? | I have been with my wife Maria for five years. There is a big age gap between us. I am 31 and she is 48. She is very beautiful but has never been married or had children before me, since she never found anyone who she really felt a connection with. 

Due to her age we knew that the chances of children were slim, which is why we haven't bothered with birth control. Imagine our shock when we found out that Maria was pregnant at her age. 

We announced it to everyone, and while all our family and friends were happy for us, lots of them began pointing out the many risks involved with being pregnant in your late forties. We are of course aware of these risks and are taking every possible precaution.

Whenever I speak to someone over the phone they will mention ask if we are staying safe or whatever and will never fail to remind us that pregnancy is dangerous at 48. 

Yesterday evening I had a go at everyone at my sister's garden party, and told them that while we appreciated their concern, we are well aware of the risks involved and don't need to be continually reminded. 

The reason I'm posting this is that some of their concerns may not be age related, and may have been the same if Maria was a younger woman. I feel like if that were the case, then I've now made them feel guilty unnecessarily.",False,False

I always make my kids involve their little cousins in their birthday parties, the most recent being a dinner that was about $40 per person and cousins didn’t even touch their food. A little annoying, but whatever. 

One of the cousin’s birthday parties is coming up at Build-a-Bear (kind of expensive IMO, you end up paying like $50 for a teddy bear, but that’s where my sister chose). My sister asked me if my kids could just “watch the little kids build their bears” because she really doesn’t have the money to pay for my kids to make bears. 

I told her that my kids would like to make bears for their baby brother. I think if she couldn’t afford this party, she shouldn’t have had it at an expensive place.

So I broke my back carrying this order and delivered it in the cold. While he was cozy in his car. And the person tipped $18 and I asked him if I could have it. He said that that wasn't the deal so no 

So a few days later there was an order worth about $18 and we picked it up. And went to the address. I went inside the building and I ate the food in the stairs and cancelled the order (cancelling after picking up doesnt assign to a new driver, the customer gets a refund and uber still pay us) so I go back to his car and I tell him let's continue working.

0,"AITA for not helping my ex-girlfriend through a PTSD episode since she just dumped me? | About 2 weeks ago my girlfriend of one year dumped me. She told me she was no longer in love with me and that she had been trying to make it work but couldn’t. She ripped my heart out of my chest and I’m pretty done with her. I have never loved anybody as much as I loved her and she just threw that away. She wouldn’t listen to anything I had to say and came over with her mind made up.

She apologized and said that she was mentally really in a bad place and asked if I could come over. I told her that I didn’t think it would be appropriate and that she was going to have to learn how to deal with it on her own. She asked me one more time saying that this had nothing to do with our relationship and that she was scared and couldn’t be alone. I felt at this point like she was trying to manipulate me so I told her that if she didn’t want to be alone then she shouldn’t have broken up with me. She didn’t respond to me for the rest of the night or in the morning even though I tried texting her. She said she had the worst flashback of her life that night and that it was cruel of me to tell her to just deal with it which I don’t think is fair.

0,"AITA for asking to be on time to a party? | Background: my wife and I have been together for 25 years, since we were freshmen in High School.  Through the course of our relationship, she has not placed a high value on being on time - in other words, she is habitually late. On the other hand, I'm likely a little too obsessed with being on time.  We have a very distinct and clear understanding about being on time: she knows I really want to be on time, while I know it's not a huge priority for her. 

Recently, we've had a streak of being late to events with our friends, due to her not getting ready on time.  My reactions vary from minor annoyance to verbally complaining about her tardiness.  2 weekends ago, we were quite late to an event, and I expressed my frustration about it on the car ride there. 

This past weekend, we had an event on Saturday night, and on Saturay morning she asked me what time I wanted to leave.  My verbatim response was ""Can we not be late?""  She then stated that she felt like she was being attacked, and that I was too often critical of her.  She then suggested that I should not mention her tardiness, even indirectly, or else I was being an asshole. I argued that I was just trying to communicate my priorities. 

We agreed to post this here to help us get neutral perspective on our actions.

1,"WIBTA for not wanting to dance with an overweight girl? | I'm in my junior year of high school and I'm in something called show choir, which is like chorus but with dancing. I'm also in theater and my plan for as long as I can remember is to be an actor and be on Broadway one day.

This year a really big overweight girl joined show choir and theater because she's a really good singer and we don't have a regular chorus for her to be in. It hasn't been too bad, she isn't the best dancer but she can keep up with the steps. In our last show, the director asked me to be her dance partner and to be nice to her because some of the other members make fun of her. I did and the show went fine.

The problem is that we just got the casting last month for our end of the year show, and I got the principle male solo and she got the girls one, which means we're partners again. The show is lots of 'swing' music and dancing and because she can't do that kind of dancing where she gets lifted up, the choreography for our parts is a lot easier.

I'm starting to put together a 'reel' of my work for applying to my dream programs for college and I don't want my big principle solo to be me doing easy dances with her. We videotaped rehearsals to watch back and I have to admit that we looked kind of dumb with everyone else swinging around and us doing an easier dance, and since she's so fat it's obvious why so it's just awkward.

I talked to the director about it and he said he was disappointed and basically told me my choices are to give up my role and be a background dancer or dance with her, and that he isn't going to recast her because she's the best female vocalist we have and she can do our simple dance routine pretty good. He said he thought that I'd be more sensitive to someone else's feelings and that I'd value having the most talented person performing instead of the best looking.

I talked to my parents and my dad agrees with the director but my mom is really mad and said she'd talk to the principal for me, because I shouldn't have to hurt my chances of getting into college because this girl has a weight problem.

1,"AITA for telling my mother she is the reason I won't wear white to my wedding? | I'm engaged. Planning on a small semi-formal beach wedding. Mum tells me that she can't wait to go wedding dress shopping with me and she wants to book an appointment at this fancy bridal shop in town. I told mum that I didn't want a white dress and that shop did just white bridal dresses and nothing else (I'd already looked it up).

I think the whole concept of white wedding dresses is stupid. It only started with Queen Vic so it's not some ancient tradition and the ship has sailed on the whole white = pure/innocent/virginal thing. However, the main and the defining reason I am anti white wedding dress, is that my mother wore a white dress when she got married, and she and dad are divorced now. Every other woman in my family has worn a coloured dress to get married in (usually either blue or red and either really pale or really dark, with not much in between) and they have all had long (mostly) happy marriages that were either til death did them part or are still going strong today.

When mum asked why I didn't want a white dress I first gave the the Queen Vic line which mum said wasn't enough justification, and then the bit about how I'm not exactly ""innocent"", which was an awful conversation to have with my mother. When she said that wasn't good enough I said ""because I just don't want a white dress and I think coloured dresses look nicer and it's my wedding so I get to pick my clothes"".

Mum asked a few more times what the real reason was and I eventually admitted that her being the only woman to break the tradition and also the only woman to get divorced didn't exactly instill me with confidence in white dresses. Mum got really quiet, then I saw she was crying. She said she tried her best and that I spoke to her like that when I know how the divorce upset her was really cruel.

I haven't apologised yet but I feel like she backed me into a corner and wouldn't accept any of the 3 perfectly fine answers I'd given before that, and I shouldn't have had to justify myself to begin with as it is my wedding so the only people whose opinions matter are me and my fiance. I also feel like if she had just accepted my choice or any of the first 3 answers I gave then I would not be in this situation.

1,"AITA for offering to pay a street performer $40 for him to stop butchering my favorite song? | I (18M) was strolling along the promenade with my sister (21F). She had to go number 2, so I waited for her outside. There was this guy around my age singing along to his guitar with his guitar case opened to accept cash. He’s not good at singing and his voice is quite irritating. I didn’t know the first song he sang so I didn’t care too much. His guitar case only had two bills in there and I didn’t see anyone put money in there. 


The next song he started singing is my favorite. It’s “California” by Phantom Planet. He whistled to replace the guitar intro and it was bad. He wasn’t even close to hitting the right notes. His voice cracked so much on the first “California, here we come”. I wanted to stop him from butchering the song because there will be a lot more screaming of that same line later in the song. I wanted him to not embarrass himself further, make my ears bleed, and disrespect the great state of California where we’re situated. 


I typed in large font on my phone’s notes app “I will give you $40 if you stop playing this song” and showed him the message and two twenties. He read it, gave me a death stare, but continued playing. I stood a few paces back to listen to the rest of his brilliant performance. As expected, he made a fool of himself when he kept cracking his voice to that line. When he finished, he only received a paltry amount of applause. No one gave him any money during his performance of that song. 


He walked over to me and started yelling at me for throwing him off. I said that he started sucking way before I approached him. It was at this moment that my sister came up and dragged me away. My sister apologized to the busker and yelled at me for being rude. She said she heard the end of his horrible performance as well, but that gave me no right to criticize him, especially around so many people. I told her about my offer to pay him $40 for him to stop playing that song. She yelled even more for that too. Some friends I texted said I didn’t do anything wrong.",False,False

1,"AITA For Coming out at my Brother's Bar Mitzvah? |  Two days ago I (F22) posted a question on relationship\_advice asking if I should come out as lesbian at my 13 year old brother's Jewish Bar Mitzvah. In Jewish culture once a boy turns 13 he is considered a man in his religion and this transition comes with a celebration along with ceremonial readings. My whole extended family came in town and I only got invited to the Bar Mitzvah through my brother due to my parents cutting ties with me a few months prior.

As I had written in the post, I had a speech prepared and said it right after the Torah readings. A lot of emotions were on the line as this has been something I had been wanting to say for quite some time. For as long as I could remember I have been attracted to women and keeping this information away from my parents/extended family has put way to much stress on me. The speech went over that fact as well as some very personal stories. Some of the stories were about the family making jokes that, unknowing to them, hurt me. My Brother had known for about 2 years, but no one else knew I was lesbian.

The speech had not gone as I expected at all. I said what I needed to say but before I could finish both my Mom and my Dad walked toward me and said something along the lines of ""Ok honey, that's enough. We've heard enough."" At this point no one in my extended family came to my rescue, and no one else was talking, just looking at me. I didn't know what to do next so I just left the event in tears, got in my car and drove off.

In my initial post on relationship\_advice I asked for fashion advice, didn't really get any real suggestions but just encase anyone was wondering, since it was an outside event I wore flat top sandals, Jeans, and a breezy blue blouse.

On my drive home I got a text from my bro saying ""wtf was that lol"" as if my feelings were somewhat of a joke to him. He knew I had been keeping this a secret for far to long and that this was the last time for a while that the extended family would be in town for me to tell them face to face. He is also the one that invited me and he knows what I come with as a person. I eminently called him in rage to get him to clarify his ""lol"".

Surprising to me he was not the person that answered the phone, It was my Mom and Dad. They only had mean things to say like ""Do you know how embarrassing that was?"" and ""We didn't invite you for a reason."" To me, they didn't want to talk about me being lesbian or the torture they put me through in high school. The conversation was very one sided and I really didn't get to talk that much (keep in mind I was driving at this point.) Also they never really called me an ""Asshole"" but they were very mad at me to say the least.

My brothers think it’s weird, but think she’s an adult so it’s really no big deal and he’s not breaking any laws. I could tell she was young, and she told me her age like she wasn’t embarrassed and or didn’t care. She is going to school for nursing and apparently is almost finished. 

I felt sick, when she left I told my father I can’t believe he’s dating a woman that young and what is wrong with him? In addition to that I called him gross. She’s two years older than me for fucks sake. When she was 2 years old my dad was 24. 

he said he was hurt that I felt that way, and I’m acting like she’s a minor and a woman who can’t make her own decisions. To be fair, my dad looks 30-35 instead of 44(my teacher thought he was my brother) but still.

1,"WIBTA for telling my BF that I didn't want to go to a local concert with him because the lead singer is someone who ruined my time in middle school. |  So just some background: I am 22F and my BF is also 22F. I'm going to call the lead singer LS. We are all from the same town and myself and the LS went to the same middle and high school.

We are both really into music and love going to concerts together - it is one of the things we bonded at the beginning of our relationship.

Last week my BF asked me if I would like to come to the local concert together - we have one every year in the town where we live and it is one of my BF's favourite things to do. However, the only issue is that the lead singer in one of the bands is someone I really don't want to meet. Considering that there is a small party after the concert, I will almost certainly have to talk to him once.

The reason I hate LS is because of what he did to me in middle school. I remember he was in my year group and had a crush on me at one point. I remember him asking me out (this was like grade 9) and me, not being into him at all, told him that I didn't want to date him. However, I found the whole experience unpleasant and awkward. He made this situation worse by going out with my one of my closest friends instead, breaking up my bond with her. To be honest, to me, he was the reason that grade 10 sucked.

A few months ago my cousin had her wedding at nearby hotel. Everyone was in the banquet room dancing, drinking, doing wedding things.

It was just so loud and chaotic so I went to the front desk reception area and found a big armchair in front of a fireplace to sit in and take a break from everything for a little while.

It was a really comfy chair and the fire made me sleepy so while I was reading I must have fallen asleep.

Next thing I remember is my dad waking me up and telling me it was time to leave. I had actually missed everything.

My cousin is finally going through all the wedding pictures. She told me how she noticed there weren’t any pictures of me and I was missing from all the family pictures too. She had noticed she hadn’t seen me much and asked if I just bailed or something.

I kind of laughed and told her how I had accidentally fallen asleep in the lobby and had missed most of it.

She wasn’t as lighthearted about it as I thought she would be and she got mad about how we don’t have any family pictures with everyone together because of me.

I’m trying to drop off my boyfriend at his job before I need to leave for mine but we’re blocked in and she’s making us both late for work. 

Another neighbor runs out to help push the car that is stuck. This neighbor sees me and my boyfriend sitting in our truck and motions us to come help push.

The neighbor throws her hands up clearly frustrated and we hear the girl who’s car it is say to her “they want to leave but they won’t help get my car unstuck ha”  in a snooty tone. 

We didn’t help because 1) this girls car has been stuck every day for the last 4 days. 2) Shes in no hurry, she’ll just stand there waiting for her car to warm up while blocking the only exit and 3) me nor my BF are in good enough shape to help push a car in the snow, plus the parking lot is icy and at a slope, we did not want the car rolling back on the ice and hitting us 

Now the girl whose car it is and the neighbor who was helping her think that me and my BF are assholes.

1,"AITA Fight mother and daughter | My sister and my mother had a fight, and my sister hasn't spoken to her since it's been about a month. My mother has tried texting and calling her, but each time she does, she ignores it. Because of this, my mother keeps asking me if I have heard from her or if I am in touch with her, and frequently rants to me about how upset she is and how angry she is about the whole situation. I have reached out to my sister on a couple of occasions asking her to answer my mother's calls and sort out the problem, or at least respond to her texts. The most recent time she got annoyed at me and said that I am only involving myself and it's not her problem. I told her that as I am living at home with my mother her not even replying to mum is involving me. For clarification I'm asking her to at the minimum respond to mums texts, or ring her and have a conversation about why she's annoyed. The way she left things with mum gave my mum the impression she never wants to speak to her again (but I know she only means a while). AITA for asking my sister to respond to my mum?",False,False
0,"AITA for not letting my fiancé take a vacation to celebrate her graduation? | My fiancé will be graduating soon.  I’ve been the sole income earner the entire time she’s been in school.  It’s actually been really shitty, I don’t make a ton of money so we haven’t been able to do anything fun for a long time now considering I’m squirreling away all extra money for our future wedding.  

Over the weekend she brought up taking a vacation after her graduation to celebrate.  I told her there’s no way my boss would give me the time off and we can’t afford it even if he could.  She said I could at least try and if I couldn’t then she could go with her sister.  That she deserves some time to recharge before jumping into the work force because who knows how long it’ll be before she could take time like that for herself.  As far as paying for it, she wants to dip into our wedding savings.  

I didn’t expect her to start working the day after graduating or anything, but this is ridiculous.  When exactly do I get time to “recharge”?   I’ve been covering everything and putting aside money for our wedding and now I’m supposed to be ok using that hard earned money to foot the bill for a beach vaycay for her and her sister?  

I told her there’s no way, but she’s not hearing me. She already knows where she wants to go and is giving me bullshit about how the wedding fund is both of our money, she should be able to use some of it.  I’m hoping this is just one of her crazy moments and she comes back around to reality.  I’m proud of what she’s accomplished, but more cake and party proud, not week long vacation at a resort proud.

1,"AITA for praying that my cousins stay fat? | My cousins have pretty much always been thin and beautiful/handsome, basically “perfect” especially in our family’s eyes. I on the other hand have always been bigger, not huge just a little bigger than average. They have given me shit all my life about what, and the way I eat. Always calling me and my sisters fat. Basically ruined every bit of confidence I had growing up. In the past 2 years they have all gained weight, some more than the others but they’re all pretty big now and no longer “perfect” to their standards. Once a couple of months ago I went to visit one of them and I had an amazing time because I actually wasn’t judged for what I ate because he was eating like shit too. Now they’re all on these new diets and are somewhat working out more and saying they’re going to all get thin again this year, but I just really hope they don’t. I want them to suffer the pain of not being thin just like they made me suffer. I am praying these diets don’t work out for them and they stay this way.",False,False
0,"AITA for sucking up to the boss to be promoted over a more qualified candidate? | I work at a startup as a programmer. I'm a decent programmer, but my real interest has always been in the business side of the operation, so I've been trying to get promoted. Problem is, there's this woman at my job who's the around the same age as me (25), let's call her Jenny, and a far better programmer than me. I knew I couldn't beat her for a promotion with my programming skills, so I considered my other options. She's really shy and doesn't have that much social skills, but I've always been a pretty extroverted, social person, so I started a two-part strategy: 1) I found ways to become more productive and optimize work time, so I could get all my work done quickly and then have free time 2) with this free time, instead of going home, I used it to zuck up to my boss, becoming pretty good friends with him.

Jenny obviously caught onto this, but she couldn't do shit since she's shy and has bad social skills. Ultimately, I ended up getting the promotion. After this, she left me a note on my desk saying I 'played this unfairly' and that she's a much better programmer. 

I wrote her a note back pointing out the promotion was to a management role, not a programming role, and besides, befriending your boss isn't unfair at all. 

Am I in the wrong here?",False,False
0,"AITA for letting my daughter foster kittens and donkeys before checking in with my ex? | I (50 f) live on a large property with my daughter ""Julie"" (16) and my husband ""John"" (52). My daughter is from a short previous relationship, and her dad usually has her on the weekends. My husband has been in Julie's life since she was 5, and she calls him dad as well. John is a veterinarian, and he, Julie and I all adore animals. She volunteers at an animal shelter and at a donkey rescue. For her birthday she adopted two donkeys from the rescue.

2 months ago, someone dumped a cat on a road near our house. We took her in and named her Puff. She hid in the hall closet most of the time, and John planned on bringing her in to the clinic when she had warmed up to him. When he brought her in, he realized that she was pregnant, and we decided to let her stay and give her and her kittens a safe home. A month ago, Julie told us that the donkey rescue had gotten two donkeys that were getting bullied. She was worried about them, and since we had previously fostered our current donkeys, we ended up fostering those two. Two weeks ago, we got a call from the shelter saying that they had gotten a mother cat with newborn kittens that had been left in a trash can for a day, and were wondering if we could foster them, since our previous fosters had been adopted. I had previously cared for a litter of kittens and had all the supplies, and after we talked about it, we agreed that yes, we could do it. John and Julie did most of the care for the donkeys and Puff did all the care for her kittens with me checking in.

When Julie had her weekly Zoom call with her dad, she told him that we had gotten more kittens, and was really excited to take care of them. He told her to get me on the phone and hang up with him. He got very mad at me for ""letting Julie get pets without consulting him"" and that she shouldn't even have donkeys since she needed to be spending her time productively and it was a waste of study time. I said that she was doing fine, and that I didn't know that I had ask him to adopt and foster pets that  didn't affect him. He then said it would trigger his asthma, which I didn't know he had until then, and that I needed to return all the animals. I refused, and he called me a giant AH and hung up. I texted him and said that by no means would I give away animals that were in need while he sat in his apartment and regularly forgot to call his daughter. I told him that when he was able to behave like an adult, not a toddler, we could discuss this.

I understand that spending too much time with her donkeys and cats could distract Julie, but she's keeping her grades up and is a responsible kid. But I also feel like her father has a right to know we fostered more animals since if he does have asthma it would normally affect him. My mom agrees with my ex, but John thinks I'm right.

1,"AITA for getting visible tattoo before being bridesmaid at friends wedding | I was meant to be a bridesmaid at the wedding  of a friend in a couple weeks time. Unfortunately this may no longer the case due to some recent conflict over my appearance.

My friend is upset that I recently got a half sleeve tattooed and coloured my hair bright red. She felt that I would ruin her wedding photos as I no longer represented the style or appearance she wanted. I  thought she was overreacting and was quite offended. However, I did offer to change back the colour of my hair in an attempt to keep the peace. Unfortunately there is nothing I can do about the tattoo which she is most upset about.

The situation has been difficult ever since and my friend yesterday told me she regrets asking me to be a bridesmaid. She tell me that I was inconsiderate for making changes to my appearance just her wedding. I felt she was being very unreasonable and to prove a point went and got another tattoo I had always wanted on my upper shoulder that would also be visible in the dress she had selected for me.

This has gotten out of hand over what was a long planned tattoo. AITA here for doing this before her wedding?",False,False
0,"AITA for leaving for work without my wife? | My wife and I both work in the same office complex which is about 20-25 minutes away from our house. We work the same hours (8-5) so it is convenient for us to carpool back and forth. For about the past two months, my wife has been consistently late getting ready which has caused me to be late to work a dozen times. I told her that she needed to be ready on time and told her that we needed to be out of the door by 7:30. She has continued to be late and I finally told her a few days ago that if she wasn’t in the car by 7:30 I was going to leave without her. Well this past Friday, she wasn’t in the car by 7:30 so I left. She called me a few minutes later asking where I was and she was furious that I left without her. I told her that she has caused me to be late multiple times and that I warned her that I would leave without her if she wasn’t on time. She told me it was disrespectful and rude. We both have our own cars so it’s not like I left her stranded at home with no way to get to work as well. Am I the asshole?",False,False
1,"AITA for making my daughter pay for her sister’s library books? | A few weeks ago my youngest baby got very sick and had to go to the hospital. I had to leave my oldest (14) with her siblings alone for a little while. While I was there I called my father and he offered to let them stay while the baby was recovering. 


At first, I didn’t know how long I would be at the hospital. At most I figured it would be a few days. So I called my daughters and said to pack a few things on a whim because they would be going to be at their grandparents house (4 hours away I should add). My dad picked them up.

They only expected to stay for a few days, but during that time I decided to move to the same city as my parents. All of our relatives live there. After the emergency with the baby I thought it would be better to live close to my family members for times like this. 

So I had my daughters stay with my parents after the baby recovered while I bought a house down there and packed the things in our old house. I had a lot to do and one of the things was to return all the old library books to our city’s library. 

But I realized they weren’t in the house. I called my second oldest and she said they were all at my parent’s house. Apparently my oldest brought them so she’d have something to read on the car ride there because her sister was done reading them. But she was not the one who checked them out. I was frustrated and told her it’s going to come out of her savings (about $100 worth). They books were around half, $50. 

I didn’t tell her in enough time for her to send them through the mail to me. She was very upset, of course, and said she didn’t know they would be staying and had every reason to believe she could’ve returned them. I understand if she knew she wouldn’t go back, she would’ve left them. But who should pay for the overdue books? I told her it was her responsibility since she was the one who took them with her. 

Am I wrong for making her pay?",False,False
1,"AITA for not apologising to my 'MIL' after getting fed up when she constantly corrects me when I introduce her as my MIL? | I'm going to keep some details vague because  this is a throwaway for the usual reasons but basically my significant other (SO) and I have been together for 15+ years, have children together, share finances,  etc. the same as any married couple but we are not married. We have discussed it and decided it's not for us.

My MIL is quite involved in our lives, which is fine and for the most part we get along well. My biggest annoyance is that whenever I introduce her to someone as ''this is my mother-in-law, her name', she will laugh and say something like, 'well, not really, because she isn't married to my son'. It makes things unnecessarily awkward.

Recently, we all attended a social occasion where there were a number of people MIL had never met and she said it every. single. damn. time. After about the fifth time I spoke quite harshly and said she was being ridiculous with her comment, and she shot back saying it was inappropriate to present myself as married when I wasn't. She then left the event early and hasn't spoken to me in three weeks now. My SO has confirmed she's angry at me and has suggested I apologise so we can all move on. 

I don't see why it's such a big deal, since mother-in-law may not be technically correct but it's the simplest way to describe a relationship that qualifies in every other way except a marriage certificate. So, AITA? Should I apologise or is she being as ridiculous as I feel she is?",False,False
0,"AITA for not giving my wife what she wants to eat? | I will try to keep this as concise as possible. 

My wife and I have been together for going on 27 years. We met at a pretty low point in both of our lives, coming from broken homes and an unhealthy dependency on food. We both probably weighed around 300lbs, and though our weight has fluctuated over the years we both currently sit at around 350lbs and 450lbs respectively, with her being the latter.

I cook all the food that we eat as my wife is unable to be on her feet long enough to make meals. I am completely okay with this, as I’ve really been able to hone in on my cooking skills over the years and can essentially throw down in the kitchen. When my oldest daughter told us she was pregnant a few months back, it really made me reevaluate our lifestyle choices. I wanna be able to run around with my grandkids, but I can’t do that in my current situation. Over the course of several months I’ve been looking into healthier alternatives of our favorite foods and trying to exercise more, slowly implementing both into our lives and my wife was initially on board.

More recently she’s stopped wanting to workout with me which I respected, but I’ve continued to cook healthier meals and she no longer wants to eat them. I’ve stopped buying junk and with a suspended license she can’t drive to get fast food, so I assumed she would just eat what I made like she always has. She feels like I’m forcing a lifestyle into her that she never agreed to, but I’m not pushing her to eat what I’ve made or workout. I suggested she could learn to cook what she wants and I would even help her, but I won’t continue to cook foods I no longer want to eat. Does this make me TA?",False,False

I bought a golden retriever dog impulsively and named him Pablo.

0,"AITA for not wanting to be friends with her anymore after she kissed me? | So I've recently found out a friend I've had since high school is 1. gay and 2. has a crush on me. I literally had no idea until yesterday when I was chilling at her place like we do sometimes after class. We were sitting next to each other on the couch watching a movie and she was leaning her head on my shoulder (I thought it was just friendly though). Then out of the blue she was like ""you know (my name) you're really beautiful."". I turned towards her and was like ""thanks?"" I mean we compliment each other all the time but the way she said it was just different. Then she leaned in and suddenly kissed me. I was so shocked I didn't do anything at first and then when I realized what was happening I pushed her away and I was like ""wtf was that?"" out of shock. She told me she has loved me for a long time but was scared to tell me because she was scared that I would react the way that I was reacting. I was like ""you know I'm straight though?"". She was like ""yea I know but you can't control who you like"". I pretty much had to reject her right then and there. Keep in mind I've talked to her about guys I'm dealing with all the time so she knew there was no point in trying to get with me. She was always single but she said she ""didn't have time to date because of university"" so I didn't think much of it, I never suspected she liked girls, let alone me. It got so awkward after that, that I had to leave. It's crazy to me that she has felt that way about me for so long but pretended not to.

I honestly don't think we can be friends anymore. I liked being friends with her but this changes everything. I can't act the same with her knowing that she likes me, I'll always second guess everything she says and does. I'm considering blocking her off everything and cutting ties but I'm just wondering if this would make me a shitty person.

We’re seeing each other monthly and take turns. We would have normally seen each other at the end of September but we were both very busy and/or away from our cities. So we’re supposed to see each other as soon as we can. It would be her turn.

However, she’s on holiday with her parents (they live in another country) and then on a business trip until mid-October. She says she doesn’t have that many leave days anymore, since she’s studying and working and needs some days off before exams. She also needs to finish writing her thesis. **She wants me to come visit her and she would pay for the ticket and food.**

But it’s not about money. **She’s shifting the resposibility to me and I’m afraid she’ll continue to do that.** It’s true I don’t have a job and I only need to write my PhD thesis, but I wanted us to stick to the plan we had in the beginning and take turns. She already saw her family in September anyway, because her mom was ill. I think in mid 20s one should prioritize their SO, not their parents. And even if I fly to her, I don’t want her to go to work while I get bored home and spend only the afternoons together.

After about 2 years I started thinking about them and messaged them. After talking for a while, they told me they had begun transitioning (ftm). This obviously came as a shock to me.

1,"AITA for threatening to tell my leasing office about my roommates animals if she tells them about my boyfriend moving in? | So I live in a three bedroom duplex with two other girls. When we first moved in our landlord was the only one that was managing the property. 

One of my roommates had a dog and a cat and asked if it was ok if the animals moved in. Our landlord said sure and didn’t even make her pay an animal deposit fee or anything like that. She checked with me and the other Roomate as well and we were fine with it because we loved her animals.

But so about a few months ago, half way through our lease, our landlord contacted us and said he wanted to go with a rental company to manage his properties and they would be taking over our lease. We were a bit upset but didn’t really have a choice. 

When the new management company contacted us to sign a new lease they told my roommate she needed to give them $500 for a two animal non refundable pet deposit. She freaked out at this and became very stressed out. My other roommate and I told her we would be fine if she just lied to the leasing office about the animals left because she couldn’t afford it. She was really appreciative and ended up doing that and the leasing office hasn’t bothered us since about it. 

But about a month and a half ago my boyfriends parents kicked him out and he had no where to go. I told him he can move into our apartment. It only took about a week for both my roommates to complain about him being there. I didn’t really understand why since all he does is sit in my room and go to work. 

Last week my roommate with the animals texted me and said that if my boyfriend doesn’t move out she’s going to the leasing office about him since we can’t have people live here that aren’t on the lease. 

I kinda freaked out and ended up texting her that if she did that I would send them proof of the animals being in the house.

0,"AITA for refusing to help my GF look for her nose piercing after she lost it for a *sixth* time? | Recently I took her to go get her nose pierced cos it was her birthday & she’s always wanted to do it. It cost me around $90 which deffo isn’t chump change cos I’m a semi-broke university student.

So we were over at her parent’s and she accidentally flushed it down the kitchen sink. Don’t ask me how, I wasn’t next to her. Her father took apart the piping underneath and managed to shake it out which was really good. She & I were both relieved. But over the past week she’s lost it *three more times*. Every time it went down our bathroom sink & I’d have to take a not insignificant amount of time to take apart the plumbing (which is nasty in its own right) and get it out. I asked her how in Jesus’ name she keeps losing it and she says that when she does a toner scrub (pours toner on a cotton pad & scrubs her face) she accidentally rips it out. Now look. I used to have a stud so I know how easy it can be to lose it but I always made sure to watch it when I was washing my face. All it takes is a bit of effort really.

So this morning she wakes me up and tells me that she’s flushed it down the god damn sink AGAIN. Obviously I’m really annoyed at this point. As I’m taking apart the plumbing once again, I tell her that this is the last time I’m doing this and that she better watch me so she knows how to do it in case she loses it again. She says fine, okay, whatever. I find it and it’s all good. 

Guess what happened an hour ago? Yep, she flushed it down the sink. For. The. Sixth. Time. And I say, look. I told you I’m not going to do it again. I didn’t say I told you so, or you’re being dumb, or anything like that. I said that that sucks but I am not going to take it apart again. Like, she’s got hands too. She’s seen me do it so many times by now she should know how to do it.

She got frustrated with me and said I’ve done it so many times so why not do it again. That made me laugh because if she really wanted me to do it then that would’ve been the worst possible thing to say. She asked me to call a plumber I said no I can’t afford that. She then threatened to call her dad to do it and I laughed again, like am I supposed to be scared of that? lol

1,"AITA for calling my SIL a liar when she wasn't around to defend herself? | My brother was telling me about his chronically unemployed wife's new job as a medical assistant. He described all these things she did on her first day, like taking vitals from patients, using an ultrasound machine, hooking up and IV, seeing a patient's genitals and some other stuff that seemed way beyond her skill level and training something a person should not be doing on her first day and it set off alarm bells for me.

I've been in a lot of medical facilities lately since I'm pregnant and about to pop and I like to chat up the people I interact with. I know a lot of the things my brother described involve certifications or multi year programs that my SIL has not done. So I expressed shock that the hospital would put an untrained person in such a patient forward position on her first day. I said I was uncomfortable with the idea of going to the hospital now if it was possible a person doing all this stuff for me was untrained like her. I also told him that going from never working more than part time to doing 12 hour shifts is very hard and instense. My husband said my tone of voice was super mean when I said this. 

I realized later that she and my brother were probably just overblowing her having a tour of the facilities. So by being shocked at this story not jibing with my experience with medical industry my husband said it came across like I was implying she was incompetent and a liar.

My kids are 12, 8, and 5. I have very fair skin and tons of freckles. 2 of them are fair skinned and have freckles. The other one has tan skin and no freckles(which is strange because my husband is also very fair skinned!). 


As a young adult my favorite line was “I love the sun but the sun doesn’t love me”. I would just sunbathe, burn like hell, then wear sunscreen the next few times. 



It really fucked me over as an adult. My skin is incredibly splotchy and rough. Thankfully, I haven’t had skin cancer yet but I won’t be shocked if it happens. I’m constantly at the dermatologist getting moles checked. 



I don’t want that for my kids. From day one they’ve worn rash guards, hats, and more “modest” when we are swimming/going to be outside for a long period of time

It started with her refusing to wear the rash guard pants/long suit so we compromised and said she could wear shorts but the top had to be a long sleeve rash guard. A hat still has to be work when not in the water. We’ve further comprised and allowed a regular bathing suit bottom but we aren’t budging on the top. This is pissing her off and has been an ongoing battle all summer. 



The issue turned in to a whole ordeal when she went on vacation with a friend. We told her we still expected her to wear a rash guard top and a hat when not swimming. 


Of course we get pictures from the friend’s mom and my daughter is wearing a bikini. I text my daughter and ask why she’s in pictures wearing a bikini. She says it’s her friends and she didn’t want to wear her rash guard because it was wet and cold. 


I text the mom and ask if my daughter has been wearing her rash guard at all and she says no, she told her she forgot her swimsuit so she’s been wearing her friend’s extra suit. I texted back and said that that’s not true, I packed it myself and she has to wear it for health reasons. The mom says ok and apologizes(I wasn’t mad at her to begin with, she’s just a polite lady). 


I tell my daughter I know she’s lying and that friend’s mom has been informed to make her wear the rash guard. She texts back “you are literally the most annoying person I’ve ever met”. 


When she returned we informed her she was grounded to not doing as she was told in regards to the rash guard, lying to us and her friend’s mom, and for that rude text she sent me.

I was at a restaurant with my family and I like duck. So seeing that on the menu I ordered it. My sister then glared at me and said ""duck?"" and I repeated my order to the waitress. My sister seemed pretty upset.

It ended brutally and was the most painful year of my life. However, after a lot of talking, we decided to be friends again and now spend a lot of time together. Whenever we get into arguments nowadays, I bring up what she did to me (she didn't just cheat on me, she rubbed it in my face and made sure I was fully aware of her and her new boyfriend. Basically showed zero remorse whatsoever and took pleasure in having a new boyfriend and still having me pine after her). She says that since I've decided to forgive her, I have no right to bring up anything she did.

She did some terrible things and I often still dream about them, which can affect my day-to-day life. I'm not looking for answers telling me not to be friends with her. It's not going to happen. Yes, I'm weak.

 The guy was pissed because he couldn't do his box jumps and asked instead if he could use the pull-up bar on the squat rack, told him no again as I was using the area and that there were other pull up bars empty he could use.

My girlfriend never liked this. She usually made some comments about how it was weird. Few days ago I was hanging out with him and my girlfriend came over, He left after 10 minutes. 

She blew up at me and said that it was extremely inappropriate and weird that I was hanging out with 16 y.o kid alone in my apartment. I find her concerns really unreasonable and ridiculous.

0,"AITA for Not Telling my Girlfriend the Real Reason I Broke Up With Her? | My now ex girlfriend lives with her sister, and I would often spend time with both of them and sometimes just her sister. For the first two years, I was madly in love with my ex and the sister was always supportive. We all got along besides small fights between my ex and I or my ex and her sister. 

However, after year two of dating, I started to notice some problems that my girlfriend and I had. Things like her not being as kind to me as I would have liked or her being very extroverted and me being very introverted. We would frequently have fights revolving around these issues.  Despite these issues, we were still working hard to rise above them and live happily (nothing worth breaking up over).

Now brings me to the meat of the problem. My ex girlfriend's sister was introverted like me and was much kinder to me and all people in general. Granted she had her own problems, but they were issues that never really bothered me. Because of this I saw myself falling for her sister. I still loved my ex at the time, but I couldn't stop my feelings over her sister. I also think it's important to note that I never acted on these feelings besides maybe some mild flirting that I quickly ended when I realized what I was doing.

I tried for multiple months to suppress these feelings and find ways to make me not be in love with her sister. I tried everything I could, but I finally decided I had to end things with my long term girlfriend. She was shocked and angry to say the least. I explained that it was because of the other problems mentioned before (partially true), but I never mentioned her sister. She was very angry with me saying it was abrupt and things were improving. I said how sorry it was, but it just couldn't do it anymore.

1,"AITA For demanding faster seating at a restaraunt | I'm on mobile, so sorry for any grammar mistakes.

The other night we were at a local restaraunt (myself, my husband, and our kids, 11 and 13). It was a last minute decision, so we didn't make a reservation.

We walked in at about the same time as another party of four, all adults. They were seated within 10 minutes, while we were left sitting and waiting. I wasn't okay with that as both kids were starving.

After 20 minutes, I was through with waiting, so I called over a waitress. I asked why a party of adults would get seated before a family with hungry kids. She told me that they had called ahead for seating.

1,"AITA for not extravagantly tipping a bartender who gave me a free drink? | So my friend works at a restaurant. I go there around closing time with another friend just to pick him up. My other friend asks him if he can give us some chicken tenders for free since they're really good at this place and they usually have extra. He's done this before a few times for my friend, but it's my first time. So we go in, and the waiter/bartender tells us the kitchen is closed. We go talk to our friend and he tells them he's gonna make it for us, so we sit down at the bar and get a beer each. Tenders come out (the bartender did bring them out, not my friend), we eat the tenders, everyone's happy. 

As we're leaving, I offer to pay the whole tab, ie. Both beers we ordered. Dude hands me the machine and he charged us for the tenders, which were more expensive than the drinks, but fine. I give him 15% for bringing the stuff out. I know some people might say 20 is the standard but I'm from a small town in the Midwest, 10 is for average, 15 is for good here. But, considering the small order, I guess I could have given him 20%. 

Anyways, as we're leaving, my friend who works at this spot tells me that the dude told him I gave him a low tip when he gave us ""free drinks"", and basically that we shouldn't come back. At first I'm like yeah I wasn't thinking, I should have covered the cost of the beer or at least close to it. But I'm realizing now a few weeks later that I should have just paid for the beers, since the tenders were a gesture from my friend who literally made them for us, not from the restaurant. How does he expect a tip like he did us a favour when he charged us for the more expensive thing I was supposed to get for free? I would have (and did) cover my friends tab later on other things in return for the wings. Why should I spend that money on you, bartender I just met? 

I also want to mention that I saw the other bartender, who was buddy buddy with this one, talking to a coworker about an Asian person referring to her as ""chinky"" and pulling her eyes into slants. This turned me off right then and there, which is probably why I just paid on autopilot to get out of there and didn't really think about the tip. Nevertheless, AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting to be friends with my group anymore? | So I just finished my freshman year in college, and I found myself a pretty good friend group. I’ve always been really shy so the fact that I‘m part of a group means a lot to me. However, I’m the only one (in a group of 8) that is not in our school’s Honors College. Many people, including them, have assured me that this doesn’t mean they’re smarter than me or harder working than me, and I’ve accepted that. 

However, Honors College people all have some required courses to take that are just for them, so they all have classes together without me.  And sometimes when we hang out, everyone talks about their classes and I feel completely left out. 

In addition, I found out that next year, they’re all living in the Honors College dorm building together. I can’t live there since I’m not in Honors College and I already feel left out enough. Now that they’ll all live together, it’s even more likely they’ll end up hanging out without me just because they’re all living together and just happen to run into each other and how can I blame them for that?? 

I have tried to talk to a couple of them about it and one in particular said that I have no right to make them feel bad for being happy that they can live together but I feel like if they had an ounce of empathy, they’d realize that 7 people of an 8 person group living together is rather unfair.

1,"AITA for breaking up with BF after he wouldn't clean up his own vomit? | There was this night we had studied together at his place and I stayed the night. It was rather uncomfortable from the get-go because he was saying he wasn't feeling well, but he didn't have a fever and didn't think it was serious. Anyway he was very agitated in bed.  
 

I had finally fallen asleep, when I woke up and found the lights on, and my BF kneeling in front of a puddle of vomit on his carpet. I ask what's going on and he says like ""sorry, do you think you can help me clean? Keep falling down"" He was speaking weird like speaking was annoying him. I told him he couldn't make me clean after his own mess and he was cryptic and I think now he said something like he thought he was allowed to ask but he wasn't making demands.  
 

Anyway he's just staying there doing nothing and I start telling him the smell is horrible. He tells me to take the blankets and go sleep on the couch. I tell him he should just ckean it up he says like ""sorry can't clean"". I leave the room to go for the couch and I just see him lie down on the carpet next to the puddle and I ask what he's doing. He says like ""can't get up. Need sleep"".  
 

Next morning I find him asleep there on the ground. The smell is horrible. I wake him up and tell him he must take care of it now. He says he will but he is barely moving and is also not getting ready. (He has to be at work in an hour). I had to leave for school. At the lunch pause I had given it enough thoughts that that experience had been disgusting and he was trying to get me to clean it up as he wasn't touching it. So I texted him to tell him I didn't want to date someone with that flaw of character and I was breaking up with him. He responded that he understood and thanking me for the good times.  
 

Since then our friends have been texting me nonstop that I'm the worst partner in the world if I will not help someone who has a stomach flu.  
 

I've asked my brother and my dad to go fetch my thing I left at his place but he refused to let them in. My friends say I'm terrible for that too because I didn't tell him they would come, and he couldn't have boxed my stuff and it's normal he wouldn't want to invite them in his place so they can just grab my things themselves.

0,"AITA for refusing to cook for my wife? | Throwaway because my wife knows my account. TLDR at the end, I know this is long.

My wife and I have been married for 3 years now and together for 6 in total, for some context. Lately (these last 6months-ish?) she's been trying my food, picking around it, and throwing most of it away. Now I'm not a chef, and sometimes my first time cooking something can turn out horribly and be replaced with take-out, and I get those. But lately it's been just about everything I cook even if it's something I know tastes good to most people. My brother eats with us often and likes my food. 

The thing is, my wife grew up in a family with middle-eastern culture, and therefore, their food. I grew up in southwest Texas. So has always told me that my food ""has no taste"", and then will subtly eat microwave chicken strips or pizza rolls after she eats none of it at dinner time. I tried fixing this, and found recipes and recipes online and got a massive spice/herb collection in the meantime. I also learned recipes hands-on from her family. Still the same thing, ""it has no taste, but that doesn't mean I don't like it!"", then she picks around it, throws it away, and eats something from a package. 

On top of the food she is used to from growing up, she doesn't eat beans, soup/stew, brown rice, anything whole wheat, seafood, pork that isn't bacon, beef, or venison. All because she doesn't like them, not for a religous/cultural/health reason. I respected that, and over the years learned to stretch chicken breast recipes out thin, because I'm not left with much. That's fine. But now the seasoning stuff? I got tired of it. Now I'm cooking steak, brisket, seafood, whatever I feel like eating/serving to company as I please. Her family likes my food, and so does mine. She also will never request something specific, and doesn't cook.

She has noticed this I started this over the last couple weeks, and is now making remarks when I tell her what's for dinner such as ""So you're just cooking for you tonight?"" and then storming off and eventually eating the same pizza-rolls/ramen she does anyway. I always make enough for her in case she changes her mind. I've heard her complain to her friends who totally agree with her being rightfully upset. AITA?

1,"AITA because I procrastinated on a group assignment but my contribution still landed us with an A? | So I'm in my senior year of highschool and about a month back I was writing a report on a chemistry experiment I did with a good friend. The experiment went horribly wrong but that wouldn't affect the grade of the report. I was supposed to write down the results and a longer, more text oriented part. Now, I have a short attention span and tend to procrastinate a lot, usually it doesn't matter because I'm a fast worker. This friend and I had a fight about me procrastinating a year before on a similar assignment and she got pretty mad. 

So it's a day before it is supposed to be handed in and I've barely started. She tells me to write down the hypothesis becuase she didn't make one before the experiment like she said she would. I was a bit annoyed because I didn't make one either, she should've done it. I said that I would, I would just have to write one like I didn't know the results. 

So it's about 8 pm and she texts me. She is furrious that I haven't started yet. I honestly forgot so I became super apologetic. I started writing and was done at about midnight. The day the report was supposed to be handed in she comes up to me and asks angrily if she should add anything. I take a look and see that she has missed writing down multiple important things. In the end she was done after I was done but she still got mad. The parts i wrote ended up getting As but hers didn't.

She hasn't spoken to me since except for once two weeks ago. She said that she rather didn't want me to join on a trip with a few friends to a harvest festival because she didn't see us as friends anymore.

1,"AITA for not moving my chair? | So today I went out for brunch at a cafe with my family and our dog, and we took turns going in and looking at the menu (they had it on the wall behind the counter) so that someone could stay at the table with the dog (he’s still a puppy and is very energetic). Wife goes in after me, and I tell her my order so she can order and pay. After she’s gone in, I decide I want to change my order, so call my wife and tell her. I also add that I want my coffee in the regular cup instead of the paper takeaway one, and she clearly says ‘OK’.

When the food comes I see that my coffee’s in the takeaway cup, not the normal eat-in cup with the little saucer. I ask my wife about it and she says she asked for the takeaway cup for both our drinks bc it would be easier for us to drink from them while looking after the dog. I get a bit annoyed at this, since she clearly said OK when I called her before, and when I tell her this, she says that she couldn’t hear well in the cafe and assumed I was just asking for my regular coffee order. Still annoyed, I tell her that she could’ve just asked again if she didn’t hear clearly the first time, and she gets annoyed and says that I can go ask for the other cup if I want.

A few minutes later, wife asks me to move my chair a bit so the dog can lie down if he wants. Half jokingly, I say OK but don’t move my chair. She asks again a few seconds later, and I do the same thing again. Son catches on to what I’m doing and says something along the lines of “can you just move your chair so Parker (our dog) can have more room?”. Everyone seems really annoyed by what I meant as sort of a joke, and I get bit annoyed at myself for having soured the mood, but this also kind of caught me off guard and I sprung into full defensive mode for my stance in our disagreement earlier, casually mentioning this time my sister’s son had to go to the emergency room because the school served him peanuts, despite her informing them beforehand of his allergy. Again, this was sort of meant in jest and I sarcastically said that this story just popped in my head, denying any relevance to to whole coffee cup thing. After this we just sort of finished eating in silence and went back home.

I guess I see how my behaviour could have been seen as a bit petty and I wish wouldn’t have let such a small problem ruin our brunch, but I’m also annoyed at how seriously everyone reacted to my joke and still stand by my point that my wife could have asked me to repeat what I said if she didn’t hear clearly the first time - so turning now to this sub, AITA?",False,False

She collects those  [Willow Tree figurines](https://www.willowtree.com) and I accidentally broke one whilst cleaning a few months back. I confessed to and apologised for it straight away, but she was super angry (justifiably so) because those things aren't exactly cheap and that one in particular had been a gift from her sister. I tried fixing it for her, but she complained it didn't look right, so I replaced it. I know it's not the same because it doesn't have the sentimental value of coming from her sister, and I definitely know that breaking it was my bad and I'm definitely the arseole there. 

However, it's been almost six months now and she won't let it go that I broke it. She makes ""jokes"" about it all the time, but they're those kind of jokes that you can just tell are thinly veiled jabs, and if we ever bicker or argue about something, she always and without fail throws it in my face. The latest incident was where she used and screwed up one of my watercolour palettes (we're both art students). I wasn't even pissed off because it wasn't like a super expensive palette and I was thinking of replacing it soon anyway but she made a point to go ""and you can't even be mad at me because *you've* broken my stuff.""

0,"AITA for refusing to let my wife give her last name to our future kid? | My wife and I have been married for 2 years now and have recently decided to start having a kid. We decided we only want one child a long time ago. My wife, Eve, wants to give our child her last name. I don't want this.

You see her last name is really common, think something like Smith or Brown. Meanwhile my last name is unique. It's not strange by any means it's just unique. Eve has 2 different brothers with kids and all of them have her last name. Meanwhile I have no siblings aside from my late sister who died 10 years ago to cancer. I have no family that has my last name aside from my parents. Ever since I was 19 (currently 29) I've wanted to make sure my last name carries on with my future kids. I don't want my last name to die with me. 

I've told Eve this and she wants to give our child her last name. She wants to carry on the tradition in her family, meanwhile I have none. I told her I want my kid to have my last name, and she refuses to listen to me. She wants to make sure our kid has only her last name. I asked about doing a middle name or hyphenate our last names and she refuses. She also has a specific middle name that she's not budging on.

I refuse to let my family name die with me. I want to make sure it's carried on in some way. She also kept her last name once we got married because she didn't want to change, which is fine. But where I draw the line is giving our kid my last name. 

I'm fine with hyphenating it or even giving him/her it as a middle name but she refuses to listen to me. This is a hill I'm willing to die on. I don't want to back down on this because it means so much to me.

So my friend, lets call her Amy, she wants to be a pro cosplayer and (her words not mine) ""just play dress up for a living/job and have a fun life"". which yeah does sound fun. But she says she refuses to do skimpy cosplays, let alone only fans stuff. Which i cant blame her for, but lets be honest the types of guys that donate to cosplay girls are looking for certain types of content and fully clothed aint it.

I do gotta admit the ones she does are pretty dang high quality, probably would win awards at cons the she refuses to go to.

If you dont want to do skimpy or nude cosplay fine I support you on that, but be honest, thats the type that makes internet money these days.  Its not other girls its you, the market for ecosplay is lewd to newd not clothed. shit talking other women doing honest work because the market you want doesnt exist isnt ok. If you cant make money doing it your way im sorry but your attitude is too much and the lies have gone on long enough. Im sorry if you cant make a living doing high quality fully clothed cosplay but sometimes thats how life is, the people with the money to give dont want to see clothes. it sucks and im not happy about it but lying and putting down women who are ok with it is not an okay thing to do.""

Recently, however, we have had some unlucky events happen which have eaten up all our disposable cash and savings. We are talking high 5 figures worth of unforeseen and unavoidable expenses, although none medical thankfully. Due to our savings, we have been able to absorb these costs without resorting to loans, but it has left us with just enough to cover the essential bills for a few months. We will be fine, but will have to tighten our belts, cancel some trips planned etc.

Now, OH has a large extended family who generally just send our kids (2.5 and 1) money for birthdays/Christmas. They are very generous and over Christmas both kids ended up with nearly $1000 which we have put straight in their bank accounts. However, OH has suggested we use the kids' money to help cover some expenses so we don't have to cancel all the plans we have made for January and February (day trips, family visits and a long weekend away with close friends). 

His argument is that the kids are too young to understand we have borrowed their money and they will enjoy the trips as they get to play with their cousins and our friends' kids. He also argues we should be able to pay them back by the summer (barring any more disasters!). I just feel like such an a-hole taking money from our kids' accounts that we don't strictly need; we can still pay essential bills, we just need to do without luxuries like trips for a bit. We have been debating this since Christmas day! 

Would we be the assholes for taking this money?",False,False
0,"AITA for leaving the taxi after the taxi driver left it turned on to get some stuff. | Okay so after an hour in the bus, I arrived from university to a city near my village, I spot a taxi driver.
I ask him if hes going there, he says: sure, come in.

After driving for around 2 minutes, he said that he needs to get someone and asked me if Im in a hurry, I said: yes a little, how much time do you need? He didnt answer back.

He then parked his car near a gaz station and received a call, I heard him saying: Yes I will get it and keep it with me, I will give it to you back tomorrow. He hangs up and tells me that he needs to get something from the doorway of a house nearby, I ask him how much time he needs, he doesnt answer back.
He then turns on the air conditionner, keeps the car turned on, the key inside and steps out of it.
 
I waited around 10 minutes, he didnt come back, I started feeling fishy about this whole situation, so I said to myself that if hes not showing up in the next 3 minutes, Im leaving it. 3 minutes passed, hes still not back, I step out, closed the door and left it as it was. Walked to a new taxi while looking back, checking if hes gonna be back, he never showed up.
I took another taxi and got home in 14 minutes.

0,"AITA for not wanting my potential new girlfriend to apply at my job? | So I’ve been thinking pretty heavily about this and am legitimately on the fence.

I started talking to this girl about a month ago now. Things have been going well for the most part, a couple of disagreements sure, but it’s good overall. 

Ive brought her around my friends a few times and she’s personable enough to get along with most people. Apparently when I brought her to a work happy hour, she started saying how much she likes the environment and people and has been asking to apply here.

Now I’m not a selfish person by any means, if anything I’m the opposite and extremely giving and empathetic (possibly to a fault). My reason for telling her I don’t want her to apply here is mainly the fact that this is the main thing I have on a daily basis that’s my own. I wouldn’t say my work and personal life are completely separate, but having someone who I’m anticipating spending a lot of time around in an intimate fashion working with me on a day to day just seems like a recipe for disaster. Worst case scenario we suffocate each other and proceed to have to communicate and see each other on a day to day? In my opinion, it feels like a huge invasion of my individual space. 

Another point, I work at a FinTech company and she has a law degree from an Ivy League school. Our legal team is microscopic and she has the opportunity to get her foot at the door at a solid firm in my city. Besides my personal feelings, seems like it would be a detrimental move to her career path.

1,"AITA for telling my best friend’s girlfriend that she’s being super ridiculous about not wanting my best friend and I to see each other anymore? | I (20F) met my best friend (21M) in 2013 when we starred in a movie together. We hit it off from the first moment and have been best friends ever since. I had some feelings for him and I’m sure he felt the same way, but we agreed to maintain our relationship as BFFs, since it’s all too easy to get caught in short-term relationships in this industry and maybe never see each other again. We didn’t want that to happen. We also promised each other to not let our own romantic relationships get in the way of our friendship.


I’ve had three boyfriends. I just got out of a relationship with my third one last month. My best friend got with his second girlfriend (19F) a little over a year ago. She just started out in this industry. Sure we hang out less often when one or both of us are in a relationship, but we haven’t lost that magical chemistry. 


My best friend’s current girlfriend has never seemed to like me. She acts cold to me even though I treat her with kindness. I’ve also only seen my best friend twice these past six months, ever since we finished filming a TV series together. I try to make plans for us to hang out together, and he almost always declines stating his busy schedule, but it’s quite clear to me that his girlfriend is behind all of this.


His girlfriend found out about my recent breakup and has probably been more on edge than ever about me. My best friend and I had plans to hang out yesterday. However, I didn’t know his girlfriend would also come. She came up to me before I could say hi and told me she doesn’t want her boyfriend and I to see each other anymore. I looked at my best friend to see if he was going to say something. He was silent. 


I told her that she was being super ridiculous and I will never try to make a move on my best friend, even if he were single. His girlfriend told me to shut up and do as she said or there will be consequences. I put my foot down for myself and for my best friend. I said “no”. I asked her if the reason she was so scared of her boyfriend hanging out with me is because she thinks she is inferior to me. She told me “you ain’t shit” and dragged her boyfriend away.

1,"AITA for telling my mom not to touch my things? | Not sure how to start this off. 

My mom and I dont have a good relationship at all, ever since I've moved in with my boyfriend it's gotten better. But not really. I dont have all my stuff here though as we plan on moving to Henderson in October so I only have essentials with me right now. 

Today, I am going to my school to get pictures for the virtual graduation next month, and I want my flute with me. My flute is my everything. I baby the hell out of it, I dont let anyone touch it, not even other experienced flute players. It's currently at my mom's house and she KNOWS I never want her to touch it. Not even if it's in the case. It's not my old student model that was only $800. This one is an Azumi Atlus, a professional model. She likes to make the excuse that she helped me get it, in a way yes. Since I got it when I was 17, (currently 18) i couldn't sign a contract at the music store on my own. So my mom signed for it in her name and payment plans were set up. However. I paid for it. Within 10 months (on a 12 month plan) I paid off $2,316. On my own. My solid silver baby was finally mine. 

It bumped my mom's credit up too especially since I paid it off early. Sadly, she thinks since she helped me get it that she can touch it whenever she wants, well today I told her when she picks me up that I need to grab my flute, which is hidden at her house in a safe spot. She said she could just bring it and I firmly said no. Now, she won't stop calling me and texting me demanding to tell her where it is and that ""I got it for you, I can touch it whenever I want."" she thinks I'm disrespectful for not letting her touch my very delicate and expensive instrument.

0,"WIBTA for asking deceased roommates’ boyfriend to move on? | This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I’m feeling like a big asshole and you’ll see why below. I’m afraid to talk to anyone because I don’t know what the right thing to do is here. 

The background to this story is that I moved in with a roommate, let’s call her Hannah, in August. We didn’t know each other before but got closer as one does when living together. Hannah was an artist, funny and we got on super well. She passed away just before new year’s in a bike accident. This was very hard for me, but nowhere as hard as it was for her family and friends. Her boyfriend Jake in particular was devastated. 

A few days after Hannah’s funeral, Jake asked for her keys to get some of her belongings. I was at work that day but when I got home that night, he was a sobbing mess. I don’t know Jake well, but he was crying in my roommates’ room, so of course I tried to help. Jake asked if he could stay the night because he could not handle going home now. 

Over the next couple of weeks, Jake sometimes stayed in Hannah’s room which I did not mind. I don’t know what it’s like to lose your partner but losing a roommate hurt so much already, so I can’t imagine what it’s like for Jake. Sometimes other friends of Hannah and her mom would come too. As her heir, her mother offered to pay Hannah’s part of her rent until they felt ready to deal with all of Hannah’s belongings. I told them to take as much time as they need. 

After that, Jake stayed over almost every night. But it started to change from him trying to be close to Hannah to him kind of living here. He would sometimes cook in middle of the night or watch movies without headphones, which would wake me up. As I was on semester break and was only working part-time, so I didn’t say anything about it. For context, Jake is a freelance producer and doesn’t have standard office hours. 

They have started to empty out her room about two weeks ago, and I’ve decided to stay out of it because it’s part of their grieving and I didn’t want to disturb. Now, the room is empty except for her bed and her piano. 

On Monday, my semester started again. I told Jake about this, that I would have to wake up early again and that I’d try to not wake him up. He promised to be quiet at night too but hasn’t. 

Additionally, with the third rent coming up, apparently Hannah’s mom is unable to pay for it. Like for most people, having to pay for another place must be expensive for her. The landlord has been amazing and simply put the rent contract on my name in January. But this means that I’ll have to come up with the rent money from now on and this is a big burden for me as well. This is why I’m considering looking for a new roommate. 

It’s Sunday afternoon, I’m sitting in my room while Jake is in the kitchen making lunch for himself. And I’m asking strangers on the internet if I would be the asshole if telling Jake about wanting to find a new roommate and asking him to go back to his apartment.",False,False
1,"AITA for not letting a friend use my umbrella in a Japanese downpour? | My friends and I went sightseeing, aware that the weather forecast was warning of heavy rain.

We’re from England, where the correct response to rain is to not acknowledge it, but things are a little different in Japan. It is impossible to walk outside without getting fully soaked. I warned my friends of this and stopped at a shop to buy an umbrella. They were reluctant to get one; either underestimating the rain or thinking they could get one later, if it actually rained.

I warned them multiple times that if it rains, I would not let them borrow my umbrella.

One friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. I reminded them that I would not share a few more times while we were walking. 

Roughly an hour later, it started raining. Hard. It was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. I stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). When we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. Neither were particularly happy.

So I signed to her saying ""now you know how I feel"" she then said ""yeah but for me it's a bit different your teachers are aware you are mute, my throat just hurts."" I signed back saying  ""yeah but you still cant talk maybe it will be a day in my life for you.""

1,"AITA for letting my ex spend the night at my apartment? | My ex and I dated for 4 years before I broke up with him. It was because of conflicting schedules and long distance. (He lives in London, I live in New York). The break up was 3 months ago. I’m seeing another guy now. We’ve been going out for a couple of weeks and just made it official. I currently live by myself in my apartment.

Two nights ago, I woke up to someone coming into my room. I turned on the lamp and realized it was my ex. He used the key I had given him prior to our breakup to come into my apartment. I was so mad at him and told him to leave. He explained that he had just arrived in the city and decided to come to my apartment so he could “checkup on me”. I said he could have at least given me a heads up instead of literally breaking into my apartment at 1 am. He apologized saying that he had tried to call me but I wasnt answering. He asked if he could stay the night. I finally relented because he was all cold and tired. 

I let him shower and get changed. I told him to sleep on the couch but he complained it was too uncomfortable and said he wanted to sleep in my bed. I said that’s not appropriate (nor healthy). But he snuck in and slept in my bed anyways. I was too tired to protest. So we technically slept in the same bed together. He cuddled me at one point but I pushed him off and told him if he tried anything I’d knee him in the balls.

When he awoke, he said he was hungry so I made breakfast for the both of us. After, he finally decided to leave. Before doing so he brought up the idea of “us” again and told me he still loved me. He said he knows I still love him too. He said he wants to isolate with me for the next few weeks, he can work from his laptop and that it will “be fun”.

I told him that I’m still trying to get over him and that he’s making it unnecessarily hard for the both of us. His voice broke and he said “But I really love you.” Anyways after a few more minutes of back and forth, he finally left (and returned the apt key to me). Since then he’s been texting me regularly but I’ve been responding with 1 word answers.

My boyfriend and I were video calling the other day, and he asked me what had happened (because I didn’t text him for a day). I told him I was deep cleaning my apartment. He asked why and I decided to be honest and told him the whole story of my ex coming in. My BF got extremely upset and said that I should have called 911 as soon as he broke into my apartment. I told him I wasn’t going to call the cops on my ex, especially not with the whole situation going on, letting him go to jail would be dangerous.

0,"AITA for being irritated that my gf went to a party without telling me | Last night my gf told me she was going out for dinner with a friend she had recently made, after which we would go to the house of a long time friend of her's & have a small movie night. The time she said to pick her up rolls around & I message her to see if she's ready to go but says she is not ready & is in fact dancing. I thought that was strange but dismissed it as her being at a restaurant where you can eat & dance. 

The night goes on & I'm waiting at home for the all clear to come get her but finally at around 22:30 she tells me that its too late to see her friend & that I might see her tomorrow followed by a bunch of videos from the night showing that she wasn't out to dinner but actually at a house party for someone's 25th birthday, presumably a friend of the girl she was supposedly at dinner with. My gf messages me around 1:30 to tell me shes home. I have a short convo with her, quickly say goodnight & leave some of her messages unread because the whole situation has left me feeling irritated.

Some context on why I feel this way is needed so I shall explain. I have no problem with her going out & having a good time with her friends with or without me, I desire no control over her in that way. Where my gripe with the situation lies is that she veiled it as something it wasn't, flaked on other plans & possibly wasn't straight forward in telling me that she didn't want me to be there as from what I saw of the party it was not exclusive & I could have been her plus 1.

Please read the texts and tell me if I’m the asshole...He constantly complains about how “I always think I’m right” but we hardly ever fight and when we do it’s because he’s accusing me of talking to other guys.

1,"AITA for not texting back friends, romantic interests, significant others? | I hate texting. I hate how everyone seems to love texting. I've had friendships and relationships end because of this issue. It was a near-constant issue in the longest relationship I've been in, which lasted two years, and that ended partially because of it. I don't see a value in texting. It's not meaningful communication to me. It's not that I don't care how your day was, but texting ""How was your day?"" ""Good. Yours?"" just seems so trite and pointless to me. 

I recently set up Tinder and Bumble profiles and over the past month I matched with a few women and we would agree to go on a date, usually a few days later in the week. But then the next day, the texts would start. ""Morning"" at 7 am. ""How's your day going"" in the middle of the day while I'm at work. WTF! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills because why on earth would I, or anyone, want to spend time staring at their phone texting small talk to someone they haven't even met yet?

Couldn't understand why as she only had 2 other table to wait on. I think nothing of it and we carry on. She brought us our food and rushed away again. We did not end up seeing her again until we were both done our meals. I'm used to a waitress coming up after we've had a couple bites to see if everything is ok and to see if perhaps there's anything else that we require. However, this waitress did not do that. As she is clearing our plates as we were finished with our meal, we asked for the bill. She asked if we wanted the bills separated to which I replied ""yes"". My bill came back to me at $29.75 for a burger and beer.  I gave the waitress $40.00 and asked for change. As she left, I wondered if she would bring me 2 $5.00 bills and a quarter or would she bring me a $5.00 bill and change? Side note, I live in Canada and we have $1 and $2 coins.  I am usually a 15% tipper.  If service is poor, it's less and if service is great, then the tip is more.  I was not overly thrilled about her service but I thought I would still leave a $5.25 as the tip, which is slightly above the 15%. But when the waitress brought back the change, she brought me back a $10.00 bill and a quarter. I couldn't believe it! I just sat there stunned! I then asked my colleague, ""Is she expecting a $10.00 tip for that service?"" I felt incredibly insulted that she would bring the change back in that manner. I thought there is no way that she doesn't understand that the change she brings me is where her tip is going to come from. It clearly felt to me that this was her hustle.  She figured that I would either leave her the $10.00 tip. So, instead of leaving her the $10.00 tip she had hoped for, I left her $0.25.

0,"AITA for being anxious about my morbidly obese friend trying to get pregnant | I've known B since high school and back then she was a healthy, active cheerleader. Fast forward 15 years and she's fought a lot of shitty, hard emotional battles and in the process gained 160+ lbs and is edging on 300 for her short stature. I love B to death and won't begrudge people their inner turmoil, but she has gotten very, very unhealthy to the point where she can't really walk for long distances and gets winded and tired extremely easily.

She's expressed a major desire to start a family with her husband and I am supportive; she'd make a great, loving mom, but I'm honestly pretty concerned for her. She's had complications with her menstrual cycle and often complains that doctors tell her to lose weight to help conceive. Her rationalization is that since her much smaller (by ~100+ lbs) sister gets pregnant at the drop of a hat, she should be able to as well. They're half sisters. She's been trying to conceive for almost a year and it's not been fruitful.

I'm getting more and more anxious for her as time goes by and made the mistake of saying that maybe she should take her doctors, multiple, advice but she just doubled down on her position. I don't know how to be supportive in a way that isn't superficial without bringing to light that part of her complications may be from being morbidly obese.

I feel like such a rotten ass for being this level of worried for her. I worry that her dream won't come true.

I worry that even if she does have a child that she won't be able to keep up with him or her; she can barely keep up just walking around shopping together. It's stupid to worry this much about a life that's not my own and maybe I'm the asshole for it because it's really not my business.

0,"AITA for refusing to rub sunscreen on a random woman? | Yesterday I, a 25 year old man, was at the beach. I was just chilling, lying on my towel and listening to music when a young woman in a stringy bathing outfit with detached top and bottom (early 20s?) comes up to me and asks me if I could help her put sunscreen on her back as she is also at the beach alone.

I looked at her, pretty sketched out. I said “um, Im not comfortable doing that, sorry.” She just said “Oh, sorry to bother you then” and left with an almost annoyed look on her face. Some people beside me looked at me like I was the world’s biggest cunt.

1,"AITA for calling my girlfriends parents lazy? | (Throwaway for anonymity)

So me and my girlfriend have been dating for 4 months now. She lives around 20 miles away. I'm at university in the UK so I can't afford insurance for my car so I couldn't drive over to her place to meet up, nor do I really know the area all too well, I'd only been there 3 months before this happened.

Now her family don't have much money, and she also doesn't go to university. But originally I thought that her family weren't doing very well financially because they were struggling with finding jobs that can provide for them. It turns out that both her parents are perfectly qualified to get jobs, they just can't be bothered getting one and live off benefits to get by. Fine, although I don't really support that, I honestly don't care.

She decides to bring me back to her house to introduce me to the rest of the family. This is when everything flipped. Her family were extremely nice at first, they looked after me, offered food, wanted to get to know me better, everything you would expect.

Her Dad asks ""So you're from \[INSERT HOME TOWN HERE\], but what brings you all the way up here?"". I reply ""Oh I'm currently studying at \[INSERT UNIVERSITY NAME HERE\]""

I recieve a soft ""Oh okay..."" and then the two parents turn to look back at the TV that was playing in the background. A minute or so pass as they turn back and say ""So, what do you want to be when you're older"". See, the subject I am studying is very broad and could branch off into many different areas so I responded with ""I don't really know, I'll just see where life takes me"".

The father then suddenly responds with a jokingly serious ""See this is what I mean, these days, people only go to university because they can't make anything else of their lives right out of sixth form. Waste of resources. University is used as an excuse for social hangouts""

He was clearly setting it up as a joke, but you could tell he was being dead serious by the way he directed laughter to his wife to encourage her to follow, and I was so shocked that my mouth was moving before I could think about what I was saying. ""Oh yeah I'm not making anything of my life whist you all sit here doing nothing with yours because you're too lazy to consider getting jobs eh?""

They did try to laugh it off but you could clearly see that he was hurt by it, I felt instant regret, but everyone fell silent afterwards and continued watching TV like nothing happened.

When it was time to go home, I said my goodbyes and headed back to mine with my GF. She didn't mention it, and as I left the front gate the smiles from the parents turned into a deathly neutral stare.

Her parents hate me now, every time I go over I can tell the mood has changed significantly from the first time I showed up at their door. Me and my girlfriend are still together but we've never mentioned it since.

So I guess, am I the asshole for calling them lazy, or should I have let his petty comment slip under the radar to avoid making enemies?",False,False
1,"AITA for suggesting PRP as a hairloss solution to SO? | Background. SO(36m) and I(24f) have been together for 5yrs. I've been a licensed stylist for 3 years. I have been his hairstylist since I started cos school 4 years ago. 

I'd say in the last 8-4 months (because he honestly gets 3-4 haircuts a year from me) I've noticed thinning/receeding in his widow's peak. Not much anywhere else. This spot that's thinning is about 2"" round right in the middle of his hairline.  The hair on his temples is thinner but that's normal from what I see as a hairstylist.

I causally brought up PRP as we were relaxing and entertaining. I have not brought it up since then. 

His answer was flat out NO. 

Before I even explained what PRP is, he straight up said no. & As I said, we were entertaining so I didn't bring it up again. *this is something that would comfortably come up in front of our guest (his buddy of 25+ years). We discuss all types of embarrassing & typically off limit topics in our close circle. 

So my question for you guys is...
WIBTA I bring it up again? 

If you don't know what PRP for hair loss is, bottom line is they draw your blood out of your arm, spin it and separate your red blood cells, plasma, and whatever else is in blood. They then take only the plasma, the Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP), and inject it into your scalp directly (the area you're treating for hair loss). 

WIBTA if I mention it again? I believe it to be safe. I can add the links to the medical spa I've researched. I can show before & after photos from the doctor I'd likely request he go with. I told him before that I would cover all costs.",False,False

0,"AITA for not standing up at an MLB game? | Ok so recently some friends and I were at a MLB game and it's probably worth noting my friends and I are not American. So at the start they had a military hero of the week or game or something and people stood up an applauded him. I did not. My friends all said I was an asshole and disrespectful. When I told my girlfriend she said the same thing. 

Now to plead my case, I have nothing against the military individual at the game. I don't think any higher or lower of anyone regarding their profession or anything like that. I don't agree with the war for a number of my own personal reasons and the issue I have in this case is the (in my opinion) propaganda phrases like ""defending our country"" and ""fighting for our freedoms"". I hear these things in my own country too. And I think the term hero should be in regard to people who do deeds that help the world and the people in it. These are my own views so please respect them and if you would like to debate them I am more than happy to do it elsewhere. 

So I didn't want to participate in something like this. And from memory about 20-40% of the people around us didn't stand and clap either, they continued eating drinking and chatting with those around them. And I've seen enough US TV shows and movies to know that I have a little something called freedom of speech, don't I? I can understand if people disagree with what I did, but I don't think I am an asshole for it. Am I?",False,False
0,"AITA for continuing to dedicate my book to my ex-wife? | During my previous marriage I wrote an extremely extensive textbook on probability. The book in question is hundreds of pages long, covers the topic in extreme detail, and includes hundreds of exercises which I also wrote up solutions to for a separate solutions manual. I should mention, as I think it's important, this is not ""undergraduate probability"" many here will be familiar with, which is generally quite trivial. This is formal probability theory which is extremely technical, and so writing a textbook with hundreds of accompanying exercises was draining to say the least. I dedicated it to my wife (now ex-wife) as she had encouraged me to continue even though I kept slacking and putting it off. Don't think I'd have finished it without her encouragement. We've since divorced and are not on good terms.

 
It's now used in many courses globally and I've received an immense amount of feedback from both instructors and students. I have written an updated edition to address the feedback I've compiled over the years.

My wife (current wife) insists I remove the dedication to my ex-wife and include her instead. I don't think this is appropriate. Even though I am on bad terms with her now, I genuinely believe she's the only reason I ended up completing it, and want to keep the dedication as a 'thank you.' When I refused, my wife went ballistic at me and it has been the source of never ending arguments since.

Am I really the asshole here?

I should clarify that this updated edition is just fixing minor details, exercises, etc. So it's not like my current wife has lended me the emotional support to ""update it"" in anyway. It's been quite a simple process.",False,False

She dresses like a teenager, crop tops, short shorts, tiny skirts and anything skimpy - it’s embarrassing when I bring my friends over and they make remarks.

I’ve asked her if she wouldn’t mind dressing differently, more age appropriate especially for a mother (she’s got a 2 year old)

My two children do not share the same father, my oldest is 11, his father has agreed to let me move and my younger is turning 5 very soon and he has said no. I have thought about this a lot and I’m not sure what else to do. Enter into a horrible custody battle with him so I can take her away from him would be a detriment to her and him cause they are very close and she thinks he has hung the moon and stars. I love her more than anything and I don’t want to hurt her. We live  in Florida but I want to return to Iowa where I was raised. The school system is better, my sons allergies would be a lot less severe, and I terribly miss the seasons and want both my kids to grow up where it’s not 100 degrees and hurricanes are threat every season. Both my oldest and I don’t tolerate the heat here well either. I know most of you will say can’t you just wait until she is old enough to decide or she turns 18 but I don’t feel like I can. My son is not receiving the best education and the schools are failing to even provide the assistance he needs. I have job offers lined up and I could make a very good lifestyle for all three of us but once again I’m not sure how much damage it could do to my little one.

1,"AITA for keeping a cat adopted from a shelter after the initial owner who lost it found photos of him on the shelter's page? | Last December, I adopted a cat from a shelter. I paid the fee that covered identification and sterilization, and was now officially the owner.
About a month later, I got a call from the shelter.
The original owner who lost it had seen photos of him on the Facebook page of the shelter, and wanted it back.
The shelter refused to give her my coordinates. They told me to not publish photos of him on the shelter page so she could not find me. They asked my what my choice was, but said they thought I should keep him. They said the cat had gone away when the previous owner had left the door of their apartment open, and there was probably a reason a cat would go away. They also said she had probably not looked hard enough for him, since they didn't find search requests for him when they found him. But they also said that the person had photos proving it was really their cat, and she genuinely looked sad to not be able to get him back. I went with their advice and kept him. Now he has a brother cat to play with, a big house, and a big garden near the nature. From a material point of view at least, I think he will have a better life here. But as I am nearing the anniversary of his adoption, I can' t help but think about it again, and wondering if I made the right choice.",False,False
1,"AITA for saying that my SIL “went to college” to become a lawyer, just to irritate her? | Few months ago I was introducing my SIL to another family member. I said, “SIL just graduated college!” Because she’d just graduated and was studying for the bar exam. She gave me a nasty look and said, “I graduated from law school, not college.” I rolled my eyes a little bit at my family member, who smiled in reply, and SIL noticed that. She continued, “I’d been going to law school, not college, there’s a difference.” 

I believe she likes to lord her level of education over the rest of my family, most of them never went to college. Just to get back at her, any chance I get, I’d say that she “went to college to be a lawyer” and describe her law school classes as “college classes.” When I told my cousin that she had a “college degree in law” at Thanksgiving, she just got up and left the table.

It was only this narrow strip, which means she must've taken the pains to crop the screenshot so only the grade letters showed up: no class names, percentages, or extra stuff.

&#x200B;

I forgot exactly what I did. I know I was kind of surprised and irritated that she did this. (Who sends their friends screenshots of their grades? Is this a thing? If so, please fill me in.) Granted, we are on the nerdier side of friends and of course we talk about grades, but I felt like this was too much. I might've ignored her text for a few hours because I was afraid I might say something wrong, which would probably mark me as the A-hole, but I can't remember if I did.

&#x200B;

Some time after she had already sent the screenshot, she texted me ""Sorry"" so I'm not sure, maybe she realized how I might feel and apologized for crossing some sort of line? (If there is, in fact, such a line?) I eventually replied, ""Truly a sight to behold"", which was deliberate in that it did not reflect my true feelings at all.

But in terms of my feelings, and my non-verbal reaction, AITA? Was I wrong to be so upset by it? I just felt it was kind of annoying and unnecessary. I'm not sure if she did it with the intention of hurting me or making me jealous; I'm less open about my grades than she is, because she gets consistent high A's on tests while I get B+'s to low A's, although formerly I was a high A's student.

0,"WIBTA for being a bad job reference for my SIL? | Phone, formatting, etc. I'll try to keep it brief. 

I've been working at a company for three months. I'm really liking it and I'm generally impressed by them as far as colleagues, company culture and product goes. I've been telling friends and family about how much I enjoy working there. 

My sister in-law heard that they got an opening and she asked me to put in a good word for her, since she wants to work at a place like the one I've talked about. My boss saw that she had applied and sent me a message saying he wanted to talk to me about her application when I had a moment (wanting me to be a reference, I'm guessing). 

I don't like my SIL and I don't want her to work there. She's possibly the most arrogant, self-centered and hateful person I've met. The way she's talked about her previous work places makes me think she's unprofessional (laughs about calling in sick to go shopping, goes into detail on things she shouldn't tell anyone else, etc). I generally don't dislike anyone, but I usually choose to, as tactfully as I can, avoid the ""non-mandatory"" family gatherings she attends. She thinks we're friends, but I'm struggling to just stay civil with her, and that's only because my wife's relationship with her sister is strained as it is and she's really trying to be close with her sister. 

The thing is that SIL really needs the job, though. She's just past 25, still living with her mother (who can't really afford having her there mooching all the time) and plans to move out as soon as she gets a job. My wife thinks it would be good for her to work for a serious company and says she'll probably change. 

I'm torn because my reasons for wanting to tell them she sucks are mostly selfish. I dont know for sure she'd do it poorly, and maybe she'd be fine. I can easily tell my boss that she's qualified for the position, which is true. Where do I put my loyalty? My wife's family? Where I work? My own selfish reasons?

Although this has no impact on my boyfriend, he says it's rude to take your shoes off once you leave the house and I should keep them on. I said if I am sitting for 2.5 hours anyways I want to rest my feet on top because I find it very uncomfortable and its not hurting anyone.

I had no problem with this but when I started taking her clothes out I saw these button pad things in there. I was kinda weirded out because they looked like diapers so when she got home I asked her what those are for.
She told me they are washable pads. Like for her period. I wasn’t mean or tried to be rude but I asked her if she’s seriously washing used bloody pads in our communal laundry. She said yes. I was honest and told her that’s a little gross and that I thought pads were meant to be disposable for a reason. She got upset and said there’s no reason why she shouldn’t wash them with the rest of her clothes and if I expected her to go to a laundromat. I told her no of course not but maybe to hand wash them next time in her bathroom.
She told her bf about it and he said I crossed a line and to apologize. Just to keep the peace I did but she’s been giving me attitude since. 
I don’t think it was unreasonable to ask her to just clean them in her bathroom because they are essentially covered in blood.

My boyfriend started getting into investing and trading soon after he met me and made a significant amount of money during the recovery. Honestly most of it is likely luck. He would put all of his spare money into his trading account to play with and it is now approaching 3m USD.

I recently asked him when we were going to get married and he brought up the topic of a prenup. He thinks that since I have little to no savings and he is worth a lot now, that he needs to protect himself “just in case.” Putting aside how insulting this was that he doesn’t think our marriage would last, I also think it’s completely unreasonable. 

Prenups are supposed to protect wealth that pre-exists a relationship. All of this money was made during our relationship - including years of us living together. While it’s true he pays for his share of the bills etc I don’t think that matters. It wouldn’t matter if we were married during this time so why should it matter if we weren’t?

Then I got out and went to the doors and stood in front of them to form the line.

Shortly after I did so, other people from other cars that has since pulled up also got out and got in line behind me. So very quickly a line was formed.

When the employee opens the doors, Miss Thang from the first car in the lot, jumps out of her car with her son and jumps in front of everyone to the front of the line. It was a cold morning so me and my son and the other patrons were out in the cold waiting our turn and forming a line.

I say to her ""Um you kinda cut in front of everyone."" She says ""I was the first person in the parking lot this morning."" I say ""Yes but an actual line formed and you never got in it. You can't wait in line sitting in your car. You should have gotten out and got in line as you saw others doing so.""

She continued to argue with me about it saying things like ""Why would I wait in the cold"" and other nonsense. I just told her ""You can have the first spot, but I am just pointing out that in the future you should actually get in line. Being in a parking lot is not the same as being in an actual line.""

This weekend my father in law came over to visit us, I don't have any issues with him as a person but lately some of his opinions have been bugging me. Whenever he sees his grandkids his main advice for them is ""enjoying life comes first, work comes second"". He says this because according to him, he made too many sacrifices for his job only to realize none of it was worth it in the end. I get what he's trying to say but at the same time I don't think this is a good message to send to a bunch of kids/teenagers for various reasons.

He told me to keep this between us and not to say anything to R because they had almost broken up previously due to his commitment issues and he didn't want to hurt her again. 

&#x200B;

This was a few weeks ago. I brought it up to B again, asking him to tell R about what had happened. He gave me an ultimatum about how our friendship would be over if I told her, and that I needed to keep her out of it because she didn't need to be involved so things could go back to normal. He said that it was a one time thing that wouldn't happen again. This whole situation feels uncomfortable to me, especially since the three of us hang out sometimes and R is moving states for B. I feel as though she should know but I know that I would be breaking B's trust.

0,"AITA for eating chikfila, and my girlfriend getting mad at me? | weird title, sorry, but i literally am not sure what to call this lol

so for some context, I am a transguy ( female to male ) as well as a pretty active member of the lgtb community. This matters , i guess. My girlfriend, who has been my girlfriend for 4 years almost, told me the other day that chikfila is a pretty homophobic organization. Which i believe her obviously, there is plenty of public evidence for that.

I fucking adore chikfila fries. I don't eat beef ( I don't like the way it tastes) so more often than not im getting chikfila .

My girlfriend told me I shouldnt eat chikfila anymore. I've known chikfila is homohphobic for a while before, so I just kind of shrug. I don't know, I feel like it doesnt really change much if I eat there, y'know?

Today I got doordash because im kind of lazy and home by myself, and I ordered from my local chikfila. It was an hour late, so I texted a screenshot of the time it was supposed to arrive by so I could complain about how long it was taking to my girlfriend because I'm petty like that.

 Anyways, she's legitimately angry with me. Like, actually mad. She's being all passive aggressive with me now,  she said its ""its hard not to be at least a little upset."" Basically, she thinks i'm being ignorant for giving money to a restaurant I know doesn't support my morals. 

I dont know, part of me feels like it's really none of her concern what I eat, especially since i'm not making her eat it or anything. But another part of me feels like i'm being a jerk for not listening to her? Especially since i'm part of the lgbt community, is it  wrong of me to order from there?",False,False
0,"AITA for pretending to be ignorant about my in-laws’ traditional gender role expectations when we stay with them? | My husband and I have been happily married for about three years. We both live in the U.S. I (30f) am American born and raised, while my husband (32m) is originally from an Asian country. He immigrated to the US for graduate school, and he now has permanent residence here. We intend to live in the US for the foreseeable future.

Because all of my husband’s family is still back in his home country, we try to go visit them once every year or two. I love to travel so it’s mostly a fun and eye-opening experience for me, and I enjoy learning about other cultures, etc. When we go, we stay with his parents, as is customary in their culture (and because they live in a major metropolis where paying for a hotel for two weeks would be prohibitively expensive). 

The problem is that his parents abide by VERY traditional gender roles - as do most people of their generation in this country. Both his dad and mom had full-time jobs, but his mom was responsible for ALL the cooking (making three meals from scratch every day for the entire household), cleaning, and laundry (which also has to be done everyday). Even when his dad retired and his mom was still working, she did 100% of the housework and he did essentially none.

That certainly is their choice and I would never comment on that or look down on their way of life. The issue is that back in the US, my husband and I share all the housework duties pretty much 50/50. We both have the same graduate degree, and we both even have the same kind of job at the same exact institution, and we each make pretty much the same salary. This equal sharing of housework is important to us, since we both are very professionally ambitious and want to prioritize our careers.

When we are staying with his family in his home country, his parents constantly make comments and jokes and ask questions about my doing the cooking, cleaning, etc. Even though we’ve explained that we share the responsibilities back home, they can’t seem to fathom this. So I feel VERY pressured to do the cooking, cleaning at their house for them. In their society, when two people get married, the couple moves in with the husband’s family, and the new wife takes charge of all the household duties so that the mother-in-law can “retire” from them.

Because his parents’ English is really rough (my husband often has to translate between us), I generally play the ignorant American and pretend not to understand that they seem to want me to do some of the cooking and cleaning when we’re at their house. That’s not to say I don’t help - I always help clear the dishes after dinner and I do my own laundry in their house. I basically do slightly more than my husband does - enough to be a polite guest but definitely not enough to fulfill the expected role of the typical daughter-in-law.

So AITA for pretending not to understand that my in-laws expect me to conform to their traditional idea of a daughter-in-law which would mean doing the housework when we stay with them?",False,False

1,"AITA for playing music while hiking. | So I recently took a trip and went hiking. I was on the trail by myself for almost an hour so I played music, I admit it was a little loud, and I didn’t notice there were people catching up. One of the men asked me to put on headphones (which I didn’t have) so I just turned it off. 

I waited for them to get ahead of me a little bit.  I started playing it again, but at a very low volume. The same man circles back and forces me to turn it off and starts recording me. I admit that the place kind of echoes so even playing it low you can still kind of hear, but if they kept going for a little more they would not have heard it. 

As he’s approaching me he said that there are signs saying no music. I’m like oh really do you have a picture of it or will we pass by one? He says that we passed the last sign that had that “rule”, how convenient. I would have googled it but I had no internet access. I go sir there’s no one here who am I disturbing? He goes “nature, the animals, and ppl who are passing by” I said when I see people I turn it off, and I’ve been on this trail and I’ve seen multiple people playing music. He goes they’re not following the rules either. This whole time he’s recording me 💀 I’m pissed and I’m like “leave me alone and I turned it off”, so idk why he was still arguing with me. He says “you Americans never respect anything” and I’m like what? I was just playing music and when you prompted me to turn it off I did. And I found the sign online and it said no loud music, it didn’t say no music period. 

Anyways it was out of character of me to argue with him but I was baffled. I understand respecting people’s costumes but the entire group he was with made it seem like I killed someone, they gave me the dirtiest looks. I am younger than them they were in their 50s and I’m 23, and I just did not understand the big deal.

1,"AITA for not paying for our daughters wedding? | My husband and I used to be petroleum engineers and are retired now. We have three kids: two daughters and a son. They had a rough childhood because we were in relative poverty at the time. It wasn't until my husband and I started and subsequently sold our own company did we start to have a nice life. They were under 10 at the time, all of them. We promised our children to pay for their weddings.

Our eldest daughter, 33 now, got married in 2013 and divorced a year later. We paid for the wedding to our daughter's specification and it cost us to the tune of $30,000. We've regretted it ever since because the money has effectively been wasted. She has no further interest in ever getting married.

Our son who is 35 has zero interest in getting married. He's expressed this sentiment for the last 15 years and we have no reason to believe he'll change his mind.

Our youngest daughter, 30 now, was proposed to by a very sweet and kind man last year. They already have two children, my only grandchildren, so I know it will last.

But my husband and I don't want to go through another wedding. We've become disillusioned with the idea of weddings, especially paying for them. We told our daughter ""we'll give you $40,000 if you get married at the courthouse, just don't have a wedding ceremony"". They own their own house outright and have no debt, so this is money for them to invest or put into savings or get properties to rent for passive income or even throw in a fire, we don't care. We're just adamant in our money not being spent on a wedding because we think it's a waste of money.

My daughter's fiancee is relenting to whatever my daughter wants but has told me in private he doesn't believe in weddings, either. He wants to get married, but more of an elopement or small 20 person thing, not a fullbown 300 person wedding like my elder daughter. My daughter is staunch in her decision to have a wedding, though.

To us, the choice is clear: if they have a wedding, we will not pay for it. That's the end of it. If they get married in a courthouse or in some other fashion, we'll pay for it and give them $40,000. My daughter argues we're blackmailing them, not even knowing her fiancee doesn't want a wedding anyways.

1,"AITA for cutting off my best friend and refusing to let her apologize? | Throwaway, sorry for length.

Background: 7 years ago, I was in a physically/emotionally abusive relationship that lasted for about 3 years. During that time, I became addicted to painkillers (prescribed originally for an injury sustained in the relationship and then became a means of coping). After the relationship ended, I spent a significant amount of time in therapy & treatment. I also finished started/finished my doctorate. I’m very private about my personal life and because I lived on the opposite side of the country while in this relationship and using, I was able to hide a lot of that part of my life from family/friends. I only told 3 close friends who lived back home, including one called K. K had been one of my best friends for the last 12 years, she knows the most intimate details about my life, and vice versa.

A year and a half ago I moved for work and K and I became even closer, as we had both recently moved to different states where we didn’t know anyone and relied on each other for ""company"" while we adjusted to the change. She was also quite stressed about money having just finished a professional degree, and work having just started a new high pressure job. We talked almost daily. At this time, I finally felt healed enough to begin dating again, and fell pretty hard for a guy named E. After \~9 serious months together, I found out E had been cheating on me. This was devastating and I relapsed. I immediately told K and my 2 other close friends who knew about my past and got myself into treatment. Surprisingly, K was completely unsympathetic and refused to discuss the breakup or how I was doing. Admittedly, it was hard for me to focus on anything else, my addiction and heartbreak were all-consuming at the time, and I took a 3 week leave of absence to deal with things. One night while on the phone, I had been having a particularly tough day and K completely blew up at me saying (and I quote) “I don’t want to hear about E anymore. You’ve become a junkie again over this person and he wasn’t even cute. Grow up.” I was beyond hurt that someone who I considered one of my best friends would say that and immediately hung up. The next day I sent her a message saying how shocked I was that she would say something like that to her closest friend, let alone one who was alone several states away, dealing with work stress and an addiction issue on top of a break up. She responded with a long message about how \*I\* was the asshole for not even bothering to find out what was going on in her life that day and why she might have been stressed enough to snap at me, and focusing so much on myself. I never responded, and have since essentially cut her out of my life. She’s texted/called me a few times and I haven’t responded.

I rejected him kindly and still wanted to be friends because he knows i am with my boyfriend for about 4 years and we have our ups and downs but he will always be the one for me. 

After still being friends he started to talk down on my boyfriend and said some rude things about him. I told him i didn't like that but wanted to be there for him because he was struggling mentally. 

We fought about it a couple of times because he was still talking down on my boyfriend. And he kept confessing to me. It's like he couldn't take no for an answer. 

I told him i don't see him like that a lot of times. He dated another girl and we didn't have any contact then.  When she broke things off he confessed to me again and i rejected him again.

I initially accepted and was very excited about all of it, but lately I've been thinking of telling her I don't want to anymore.

I'm not allowed to attend and watch them actually get married, my immediate and extended family are all Mormon, so my little sister is getting married in a Mormon temple. As soon as I found out it was a Temple wedding I tried to renew my temple recommend (you need one to get into the temple), so I sat through an interview and lied about a lot of questions (I'd be considered ""unworthy"" if I told the truth), but then I was told I'd have to pay around 15,000 of back tithing because I haven't paid in 5 years. I obviously didn't do that.

I told my sister I couldn't get a recommend and she said ""that's fine you can watch all the kids outside of the temple"" and I didn't want to at first but I agreed since it would be her wedding day. I said ""lol ok but who's going to watch them at the ring exchange after the temple"" (mormons just recently allowed having another wedding ceremony before or after the temple without waiting a year) and she said they aren't doing one anymore because Joe said it would ""steal away from the sacredness of just being sealed"". Now I have to be a bride's maid for a temple marriage (even thought have a wedding line doesn't make sense with a temple marriage), not see my little sister get married, and play babysitter in a parking lot.

As such, i want both of my parents to visit me next month for a week, during the time i graduate so that they will be present in the ceremony.

&#x200B;

My parents are divorced, and it is the first time for my mom to come visit me and the second time for my father (and his girlfriend). Because it is a huge milestone for me and a special occasion, i wanted both of my parents to come alone without their SO's.

&#x200B;

Here is the problem: Both of my parents want to take their SO's while coming to visit me. They won't be present in the ceremony, but obviously I will have to take them around the city for the rest of time. I really don't want to deal with this hassle during a special occasion in my life, and have no issues if they want to come over at any other time. I made this explicit for them.

&#x200B;

I begged my father several times not to take her SO, however, he thinks that I have no right to decide anything for them since they are the ones that pay for my studies and well, everything else. He mentioned that by coming alone to visit me with his ex-wife (my mom), he will hurt his girlfriend and their relationship. As such, his girlfriend booked already two tickets for him and for herself, because she also wanted to tag along.

&#x200B;

My mom was a bit more understanding. She actually talked with her SO and he understood why he shouldn't come. However, after she heard that my father is also taking his girlfriend, my mom also wants to take her boyfriend over and is very hurt at me for not wanting her to do the same as my father.

Both of them are afraid that their SO will be hurt for not coming along, however, i feel the worst in this situation, because i feel that my parents don't care for me as much as they should. I think that, if they are really afraid that their SO will be hurt over visiting their only child for one week, then their relationship is weak without trust, and shouldn't be together in the first place.

&#x200B;

Personally, i don't understand why my parents don't see my position or don't prioritize my happiness over their personal relationships. It will be incredibly troublesome to take care of two separate groups during a whole week. Similarly, I also don't understand why their SO's cannot see how this is wrong and why would they want to tag along to an event which has nothing to do with them, nor they will be able to come to it?

So basically my son called me and said that Cassie would like to bury the hatchet this year and actually invited me to the birthday party. I asked if I could bring anything. He said if would be a big help if I stopped and got a Taco Bell party pack on the way over since Cassie wants Taco Bell instead of a cake and they don’t have one within 30 minutes of their house. I asked why Taco Bell and he said that Cassie is back on her “caveman diet” and Taco Bell is a treat but not like a sugar implosion like a cake. I said I’d think about it. He asked me to please not make an issue of this and please just get Taco Bell. I told him I just can’t see depriving a party of a birthday cake. He said if I can’t just bring the Taco Bell, please let him know and he’d handle it. 

The issue is, I’m disgusted with the way she feeds her family. The kids have zero fun when it comes to food and they are what I would consider brainwashed. Oh the rare occasion Cassie let’s me watch the kids, they will have one chocolate milk and arent interested in kids foods like cookies and fruit roll ups.

 I feel like I would be giving into the nonsense if I bring Taco Bell and not a birthday cake. I make an amazing traditional chocolate cake and I feel it would make the other guests not think Cassie is so odd. And it will quickly be overlooked and I get to make my statement in a quiet and dignified manner and maybe even subtly nudge her in the direction of allowing her kids a normal childhood than that would be a good thing.

So I was on a southwest flight, which if you didn’t know, has an open seating policy. So it’s basically a first come first serve for seats on the plane.  I sat kind of near the back at a window seat because I enjoy being able to lean against the side of the plane to feel like I have some extra room. I’d also like to mention that the row I was sitting on was empty, so only the middle and aisle seats were left.

After sitting for a few minutes and waiting for everyone to board, a mother and her young daughter (I’m assuming she was about 6 or 7) came to where I was sitting, probably because the plane was starting to get full and they were able to find two seats together. 

The mother gave me a smile and asked me if I would mind sitting in the aisle seat because this was her daughter’s first flight and her daughter wanted to look out of the window to see the view outside of the plane. I said something along the lines of “actually, I'd rather stay here if you don’t mind, thanks”. I didn’t give her reasoning because she didn’t ask, but I didn’t want to give up the window seat because I don’t like it when the plane window is opened, because the light is blinding to me, and it’s still an inconvenience when I look away. Two, I liked the window seat for the leaning thing I mentioned earlier.

The mom looked kind of annoyed but the daughter sat in the middle seat and she sat in the aisle. I kept the window closed and was pretty comfortable throughout the flight. Then at some point during the flight the daughter was like “mommy I want to see” and the mom responded passive aggressively by saying “well honey, unfortunately I can’t open the window so I can’t make that happen”.

Btw I say “bf” because he never really proposed, we just sort of started planning our wedding recently.

The thing is, a typical wedding is not really something I want for myself, for various reasons. It all boils down to the fact that I would be highly uncomfortable with a typical wedding. There’s just nothing about it that sounds appealing to me and I want my wedding day to be fun, not feel like a chore. So the only way I can envision us getting married is if we elope and/or it’s just the two of us. Absolutely no one else.

My bf on the other hand thinks that’s the most horrible idea on Earth. He thinks it wouldn’t be a proper or serious wedding if the people he cared about (his parents and siblings) weren’t there. 

We literally just had a conversation about this that ended up with somewhat of a fight and him storming away. He says he just can’t understand the source of my discomfort.

The thing is, I don't take cricket as seriously as most guys my age- it's fun, to be sure, and being a good player improves your popularity and attraction from girls, but I'm not extremely attached to it and have zero intention of trying to go pro. That's why I don't join any competitive teams or coaching programs- I intend to study economics/business and probably go into business in the future, and plus I enjoy spending my free time hanging out. If I were to start playing competitively, that'd take up all my time for no reason.

Anyways, I wanted to be captain of my team, and everyone expected me to be. I know for a fact that most of the team voted for me (votes are public). However, I was passed over and the captaincy was given to someone else because according to the coaches 'he has more ability to build camaraderie' (the coaches are the ones who ultimately decide, regardless of votes). I felt like I had been stiffed, and as I mentioned, I don't really care all that much for cricket to begin with- it's fun, but not so fun I had to stand being stiffed. So I quit in protest, and a few of my friends did the same.

Since then, the team has been suffering a lot and losing matches, and the coach is asking me to come back. I told him I wouldn't since he stiffed me over the captaincy, and he called me an asshole.

Am I? I think I have a right to quit the team if I want, and he's not right for stiffing me in the first place.",False,False

1,"AITA for making a ‘sick’ customer pay | I run a business in the health industry offering nutrition advice. Basically a consultancy kind of setup.

I have this client who has been with me for 2 years. He is on a subscription payment. He pays each month. And he has done for 2 years with no problems at all.

Last month I was looking at my accounts and noticed that I hadn’t received his payment. This is weird I though.

I contacted the customer asking him why I hadn’t received his payment and his excuse was:

Something to this effect: So sorry (he was very apologetic) I have had surgery recently and have picked up a serious infection which has left me hospitalised and unable to do anything. I will make sure I pay you ASAP.

He did eventually pay two days later, apparently he got his mother to pay the money across.

Now don’t get me wrong. I feel for him. I really do. Very sorry to hear this. But I don’t consider this a valid excuse in the sense that if you can type a fucking email then you can click a few buttons to pay me some money for a service that I have ALREADY provided. It just seems like a cop out.

I have since told him that if this happens again then I will be removing him from the system (which will leave him in a terrible situation as he is halfway through the nutrition system and cycle which will not be a healthy move at all)

He seemed very annoyed by this.

I am just wondering was I unfair? I mean remember I am in business I have to make sure my clients pay up or things will fall apart.  I don’t think what I did  was unfair etc. Again I feel for the guy, but it’s no excuse.

1,"AITA for leaving my door unlocked against my roommates' wishes? | For context, me and my roommates live in a small three bedroom house in Tucson,AZ. My bedroom is the master bedroom and I pay what they both pay in rent combined for it. My room was built as an add on to the house, so there's a door to our backyard in it. About a year ago, shortly after I moved in to the room, I was thinking about how convenient it would be to be able to come in through that door. A lot of times, my hands are super full coming into the house, it's the easier door to open, and the bed is right there when you walk in so I can drop everything if it's heavy. I am also one of those people who always forgets something inside, so locking the door is always a pain because a lot of times I'm going to have to unlock it immediately anyway.

Then I realized, why not leave it unlocked? How much does a locked door actually deter a burglar? I did some quick research and while consensus is generally in favor of locking your doors, there are some people that leave their doors unlocked. I didn't see it any different really as leaving a spare key somewhere nearby. I've been burgled before, while I was sleeping and with a dog in the house, so I know that if a burglar really want's to get in, one small deadbolt isn't going to stop them. I decided to start leaving the door unlocked, and I didn't tell my roommates because in my opinion there wasn't anything to tell.

Now, one year later, my roommates find out about it. They think there's no reason to leave the door unlocked and they ask me to start locking it. I explained everything above to them, but they did not agree. One of my roommates then proceeded to enter my room every day to lock it from the inside against my wishes. I'm a big proponent of not getting into fights with your roommates, so I let it slide for a while hoping that maybe he would give up, or maybe I would get used to it. But every time I had to pee, or the wind was whipping around outside, and the smart lock on our front door wouldn't open and I had to re-pair my phone to it, I grew a little bit more resentful. One of my roommates has a pet, even though that's against our lease, but I take that risk. And he's moving out in June!

A couple of days ago, I locked my room's interior door from the inside so that if my roommate wanted to lock it, he would have to go outside and use his key. This started a rehashing of the whole fight, and now we're stuck. My argument is that the thing they are scared of is not any more likely whether or not I leave my door unlocked, at least not in a reasonable way. I am taking the same risk as them, yet I am not scared. The idea came up that I should pay if any of their stuff gets stolen, but then I am providing them with free insurance since there's probably not going to be a way to know whether my door being locked would have deterred the thief. Their argument is that they are not getting any benefit from this, and thus should not have to take any risk no matter how minute it is.

However, we think it'd be wrong and unnatural to do that; despite all the benefits and what not. Plus, since he's purebred, we wanted to have him breed.

0,"AITA For confronting a man for disrespecting my wife at a party? | Me and my wife were at a new years BBQ. It was for our entire apartment complex so there were a lot of people we havent met there. Against our better judgement we decide to stay late into the night and drink a bit since we dont get out much.

A drunk man who we've never met approaches us and leers at my wife, right in front of us. Just casually checking her out and I could see she was uncomfortable. I ask the guy if he has a problem and he laughs at me, saying theres no problem here.

My wife pulls me away from the situation but it does not stop there. He starts pointing at my wife and me across the plaza, making gestures with his hand. At this point I am livid but my wife tells me to ignore it.

Later me and her separate as she has to go to the bathroom. As shes coming back this scumfuck grabs her arm and sort of twirls her, like in a dance. I rush over, fuming. He says he wanted to show me how a real man dances with a woman.

Enraged, I slap his drink on the ground and tell him that I would cut his hand off if he touches my wife again. I dont actually make physical contact with him as this creates a spectacle . The music stops and my neighbors are between me and him. I was very angry. He says sorry repeatedly but i think he didnt really mean it.

His friends apologize to me as well. Well now its been several weeks and i have a letter from the complex chastising me for my behavior that night. Apparently either the drunk or someone else complained that i was threatening people. My wife is shocked as well and says we should dispute the accusations.

0,"AITA for renting a house and telling my neighbors to go to the landlord with complaints? | I have a house I rent, and some of my neighbors have complaints about the property and it's maintenance.

I rent partially because I don't have the time to do the maintenance and I wanted a lease that put the landlord in charge of all that. And that's what I found; my landlord is responsible for all maintenance and landscaping and such.

He lives a few states over and sends guys he knows for maintenance.

Anyway, some of my neighbors have used me as a scapegoat for things they don't like about the house. What's grown in the yard, how it's an eyesore, how the siding needs to be washed.

I've said that they can tell my landlord about it.

They've gotten mad saying that if I live somewhere I should take some pride in it and do the bare minimum to make it presentable. I said that I picked a place where someone else was in charge of landscaping and stuff for a reason, and they really ought to call him or write him a letter or something.

They've all been pretty mad at me and I feel like there just mad because they can't get in touch with the landlord and I'm an easy target because I'm right there.

0,"AITA for cutting contact with my vegetarian friend? | I know the title is misleading. I did not cut contact because my (ex)friend is vegetarian, but it did play a big part of it. 

We had been friends for approximately 5 years and he had been vegetarian for the latter half of those, but only within the last year complications started to surface. He’s always been openly disapproving of my diet choice as a non-vegetarian but I never really minded it before. 

I get it, he’s very passionate about it and wanted his friends to be “morally correct” as well and I don’t blame him. I had explained my reasons for not wanting to go vegetarian and I could tell he didn’t think they were good enough reasons but I didn’t think any of it. It was my own choice anyway and I feel it would be a wrong reason to change my diet if it was only to please my friend and not because it was rooted in some personal morality or ideals. 

We had decided we just shouldn’t talk about the subject anymore, because we would always get into arguments about it. Not about wether or not he should be vegetarian, of course, I supported him and admired him for being so passionate about a cause that does more good than harm anyway. And that worked for a while. 

Until he learned that I was working towards becoming a veterinarian doctor. He started tweeting things on his “private account” that was obviously about me. I told him I didn’t want to read it because it upset me to the core so I had unfollowed that account, and then he started doing it on his “public account” as to make sure I saw it. It would be comments like “I’d never trust a vet who is also a meat eater” and other things along those lines. When I brought it up to him he told me it was because he cared about me too much and that it was a coping mechanism to “like me less” and because he didn’t want his friends to do things that worsened the current environmental issues and also hurting animals. 

I said some things I regret now in that conversation. We were talking about how I did everything I could to help the environmental situation the ways I could, like not driving cars, etc. Which I guess he took very personal as well, as he loves driving his car. We both came with some pretty awful comments until he said something personal about my private life that made me snap and just end the friendship right there, which hurt his feelings A LOT as I know he did actually care a lot about me and our friendship. 

Lately I’ve been wondering wether I overreacted? Should I have tackled the situation differently? And I an asshole for not considering his feelings and respecting his ideals enough?

1,"AITA for asking my rich brother to contribute more to our father’s healthcare costs? | My brother is 34 and I am 26. We share the same mother. My father, 68, married my mother when my brother was 8. 

My brother has never had a good relationship with our father. He never called him “dad”. To be fair dad was hard on him, and he did display favouritism towards me (as I was his biological daughter). 

When he was 13 and I was 5, our mother passed from cancer. His relationship with our dad soured even more after that, and as a teenager they’d get into a lot of fights. 

My brother left home at 18 for university and never looked back. He barely visited us, only for Christmas. He met a girl at school and they got married young. He didn’t tell our dad about his first grandkid and if wasnt for me, he would never have known.

Anyways, he became a doctor. His wife and him soon opened a successful medical spa. Now it has multiple locations and they are easily earning $500k a year. I know this because my friend works as their secretary.

They live in a gigantic mansion, they drive brand name cars, their kids go to private schools. His wife wears all designer clothes. They go on vacation every other month. Point is, they’re loaded as fuck.

My dad got diagnosed with a terminal cancer 1 month ago. He’s declined very quickly and is at home with my husband and I. I told my brother, who came to visit for 2 days. It was a brief and awkward meeting.

Before he left, my brother told me he’d be willing to cover half of the costs of a private caregiver. I said ok, because I didn’t think it would be too expensive.

In fact, its insanely expensive. I called him and told him I can’t afford even half of the caregivers salary, and I asked if he could contribute more. He said he’d cover 60% and no more. We got into an argument and he said “Why should I treat this man as a dad when he’s never even treated me like a son?” I said now is not the time for decades long quarrels.

Is it absurd for me to expect him to pay more than 60%? He literally earns 10x more than me a year! I’d take care of my dad myself, but that would mean taking time off work and I can’t do that.

I’m feeling really stressed right now. The govt supplied home care that visits us is not enough. I do whatever I can after work but its the morning that we need the most care. I’ve tried my best to increase our govt care but to no avail. I feel inadequate, like I can’t provide my father with a good quality of life in his last months on earth. What infuriates me is that my brother could easily cover all the costs of a private caregiver for the rest of my dad’s life, and then some, just by going on 1 less vacation this year.

At least his wife was kind enough to send a brand new hospital style bed for my father to use. I doubt my brother knew that she did this, and would probably get mad at her if he found out.

I may be young but I know for a fact that theres no way shes gonna look the same after she has a baby, considering she's short like I am as well.

1,"AITA for reprimanding my friends at the movie theater for eating their snacks before the movie starts? | Today, I messaged my friends as part of a group chat saying that when able, I wanted us all to go to the movies. They agreed, but told me that they get very annoyed about something I do while there that they need to talk to me about before we go back.

When I go to the movies with these friends, I noticed that they all eat their snacks very fast, almost halfway done before the movie even starts, and then they get up multiple times throughout the movie to use the bathroom and buy more snacks. Additionally, because they always INSIST we sit in the back row toward the middle, and there are always 6 of us, they end up climbing over me multiple times to do this. Sometimes, because they blow through their money, they even ask me to pay for their snacks or to get up to get them their snacks!! Worse case scenario they reach into MY popcorn bucket and start helping themselves. It drives me nuts, and I am also a germaphobe who cannot stand other people's hands in my food.

As such, I established a ""rule"" that we wait until the movie actually starts before beginning to eat our snacks. I always do this and I am able to pace myself through my snacks, and I rarely if ever have to get up in the middle of the movie and inconvenience the people around me. They resist the rule but I am so persistent that they don't feel like arguing and just wait to eat their snacks now, but they indicated me doing this is annoying and the next time we go they don't want to hear it.

I feel like there can be a compromise but they are unwilling to do so. If they allowed me to sit exactly in the middle so that they are less likely to climb over me, agree to budget better, and do not ask me to pay for them or try eating my snacks when they finish theirs, I would not have needed to establish this ""rule"" to begin with.

1,"AITA for giving my daughter an ultimatum? | Some background: We are not from the US. I have a (18M) son and (17F) daughter. They do decently well in school (my son has an average mark of 8/10 and my daughter has an average mark of 7/10). My son has always liked technology and the ""STEM"" fields. He has a dream to work at a large company developing robots. My daughter on the other hand is a bit more creative. She doesn't like math, science, or anything of that format. Her grades are an average of 4-5 in the STEM categories, while 8-9 in the humanitarian categories. 

They are in the same grade and will finish 12th grade this year (however they are at different schools). Then it is time for them to pick which uni to go to. There is an option offered for students to go abroad and study in a different country which they would both really like since our country is not developed, and I approve of this as it would give them life experience and teach them more as they will have higher quality professors. 

The issue with this is that it costs money. I can afford to send them both to a university in different countries if we sell our current apartment and I rent a smaller a smaller apartment to live in by myself until they come home and scrape by, as almost all of my salary will be going for their tuition costs, apartment, food, and other necessities. I am willing to do this, but only for my son, and I will explain why.

When he goes to a different country, he plans to study Computer Science and Mathematics as a dual-major. He takes it very seriously and has been studying every day (including the weekends) to make sure he succeeds at this university. He is very competitive and I couldn't be more proud of him.

My daughter on the other hand, not so much. She would like to study history which in my opinion simply is not worth the money. I have let her know of my stance of this, and I told her that if she wants my financial support she will have to go for a STEM-related field. We are not a rich family, we are very poor and I am not going to work 10+ hour shifts just for her to learn history. I told her she can go into psychology, or some kind of medicinal branch, but she said she wouldn't do well in school for that.

Now the larger problem comes in that when my son does move out to university, I will still have to cut down on a lot of costs, and the nearest university from us is a good 12+ hours away and they do not offer dorm rooms, so she basically has no choice even to go to university in our country.

1,"WIBTA for canceling my wedding gift check? | This weekend, my boyfriend and I went to the wedding of a friend who I hadn't seen in a couple years. She and I had been part of a sisterhood-type group. I was incredibly excited to get to see all my friends from the group who live all over the country, and to party!

The bride offered her house for us to stay at for the two nights we were there. This is a typical arrangement for the group I am a part of because it requires a lot of travel and the community is very supportive. Before we left home, my boyfriend and I decided to gift $200 both as a wedding gift and a thank you for giving us a place to stay. (Alternate accommodations would have been around $50 per night)

Going to the wedding required both me and my boyfriend to take time off of work (costing me somewhere around $100 and him around $200), required me to buy a new dress to match the color theme ($100), and required a 20hr round trip drive.

Up until this point, everything was fine and I was happy to sacrifice my time and money to be with my friend on her special day. When we got to the ceremony, I knew absolutely no one. I was surprised because the bride said she was inviting everyone from our group. As the ceremony started, I realized that all of the other people in the group at the wedding were bridesmaids. I'm not gonna lie, that really hurt, but at this point I was still fine - maybe she was closer with those girls, and we would still have fun and hang out at the reception.

Then we get to the reception, and there's no alcohol. Or, I guess to be more specific, they are not serving any alcohol, but a subset of people were apparently told that the event would be BYOB and have their own personal alcohol for their groups (again, me and my boyfriend know absolutely no one). My boyfriend immediately said we'd given too much money for a wedding without an open bar and a plated dinner (they had a barbecue buffet).

We stuck around awkwardly for awhile and eventually all the bridesmaids arrived. They came over to chat and it was immediately apparent that they felt incredibly awkward that they were bridesmaids and I wasn't, they had all been there since the middle of the week to catch up and had established a bunch of inside jokes, and they were really just saying hi to be polite (after a very awkward few minutes of conversation, they left to continue circulating around the reception).

I told my boyfriend that I just wanted to go home, and we left as soon as we could without even touching the food and drove the 10 hours home that night. As we were leaving, he said I should cancel the check and save us both $100. At first I agreed because that's a lot of money for me right now, and I don't plan on having a relationship with any of those girls after this. But the bride did let us stay with her and was thoughtful enough to invite us, and after sleeping on it, I'm on the fence.

So we're leaving the decision up to you, reddit. WIBTA if I canceled the check?",False,False
0,"AITA if I (M17) initially said Yes to a girl's ask to a dance then told her No in private? | Throwaway.

So at our high school, we have three different dances every year. For one of the dances, instead of the boy asking the girl, the girl would ask the boy. It makes for a nice mix up. Everyone is the same age in this if that's important.

&#x200B;

So to provide some background to the situation, I've been seeing this girl I really like, I'll call her Abby, for a few months. We haven't been super public about our relationship so not everyone in the school is aware, mostly just her and my friend group and a few outsiders. I knew she was going to ask me to this dance soon. (because she told me she was working on a sign/poster for me). I couldn't wait. She's amazing.

&#x200B;

Now the situation begins. Enter another girl, I'll call her Emma. I guess I'm friends with Emma, she's more Abby's friend than mine really but even she isn't that close with her. I've talked to her a few times. On the first day people start asking someone to the dance, Emma comes up to me with a very large crowd of people and a very elaborate sign and asks me to the dance. Normally, I would have told her no and apologized but she had really brought this whole crowd of like 30 people that stood around us in a circle. I was put in a spot. I didn't want to embarrass her so I told her 'Yes' to the roaring applause of all her friends. After the situation had died down like ten minutes later, I quickly pulled her aside in private and told her I couldn't accept her invite because of Abby's invite coming and that we were a thing. I told her I didn't want to publicly embarrass her in front of her friends by saying no. She gets all pissy and calls me an asshole.

So reddit, I have come to see my judgement. AITA?

1,"WIBTA for having an unequal will drafted even though my kids are young? | I'm 44 with an 18 year old daughter and a 16 year old son. I'm a single father since my wife passed three year ago. Not that it's relevant, but both she and our second daughter passed during childbirth.

I've been dealing with thoughts of mortality and death recently and figured I should get a will drafted to ensure my children are secure. Even though they're still young, I think at this point how they act and behave resembles what they will as they're older. I think most people become themselves around these ages.

I want to split it 90/10 favoring my daughter. She's about to graduate university after an accelerated highschool program and my son wants to drop out the moment he can (here it's at 17). Here's a few things my son has done or has been a part of that cements my idea:

- got two girls pregnant, both were terminated
- has been expelled from one highschool and had to be put in another in a further district
- has already been involved with the police for driving without a license, driving inebriated, and felonious assault (knife)

As much as I love my son since a father's love is unconditional, I don't _like_ him if that makes sense. I believe he has no future and it's not a function of his upbringing, else my daughter wouldn't be at her point. He's just a bad seed, it can't be helped despite my attempts.

My estate isn't huge. I'd give him nothing but at least 10% of my estate ensures he can't contest it and it's enough to get him a couple years of rent. If he makes a complete 180, sure I can get it changed, but I'm confident I won't have to.

1,"AITA for cutting of my parents after the bull shit response they gave of why me and my daughter where not invited to the family Christmas celebration | Throwaway 

I am a 44 year old mom and I hated how my parents forced religion on to me and with that traditional gender roles. I have a daughter 8 who has never been invited to a family Christmas celebration. I told them that when my daughter was being born if they ever teach their religion on to her I will cut them off.

Anyway today I was at my parents house fixing there washing machine. My brother told our parents I can't wait for next year Christmas celebration I am then asked then asked them why I was not invited for a Christmas celebration for 8 years and my daughter as well. 

My mom said because you are not religious and our family is and that on Christmas day after gift opening which lasts around 30 minutes we go eat breakfast and then go to the church and pray. Then we go out to eat lunch.

 My brother then cut of my parents and said we don't want to be cut off from them because if you discover we are doing religious things around your daughter you will cut us off. I then asked them why can't I bring my daughter to the gift giving. 

They said that that people from the family come over to eat dinner and then read pages from the bible at night and that the people from the family and then the family goes to sleep. 

After that when they wake up the kids give presents and if the daughter where to see that the kids went somewhere else after presents she would want to join then she would want to learn about religion and then they would be cut off.

At this point I was furious I left the washing machine there and told them find some one else to fix and yelled at them that they are being discriminatory to atheists and that they are just mad because one person is not following there fucking religion. I told them that they can expect today the last they they can see me.

1,"AITA for visiting my ex in jail against the wishes of my girlfriend? | I live with my girlfriend Molly and have done for the past two years. I love her and since we're both financially stable we're thinking of starting a family together. 

My ex girlfriend Amy is in jail. She worked in finance, pretty high up, already earning great money but got involved in an illegal scheme to make ''easy money''. Everyone involved has been jailed. I heard about this and thought it was a shame, but we haven't been together for four years so I had no reason to reach out to her. That was until I received a letter from her in the post, where she told me that all her family and friends had cut her off, and asking if I could be in contact with her purely as a friend, so she has someone she could talk to on the outside. I agreed and visited her today.

Amy's family are upper class types who are obsessed with their ''reputation'' and so cut their ''criminal'' daughter off. Most of her friends are from the same professional circles as her so they don't want to know her either. I'm her only friend outside the prison. 

She's a complete wreck of a person. When she saw me she broke down in tears as I'm the first person who's ever visited her. Amy doesn't belong in there at all. She's going out of her mind with boredom sitting in her cell. While she has been put on some courses they are far below her capability (she has a degree in mathematics and numerous financial certifications, and they're only offering her very basic skills courses). She has to wear clothes that are usually over/undersized and have been worn by many others before. From what she's said I think she's being bullied in there too. She's said a lot of the other women ''don't like her'' because apparently she comes across as spoiled and snobby. 

After the visit she hugged me and thanked me for coming, and I said I'd try to come once a month. Molly was OK with me seeing Amy beforehand, but when I got home she said she doesn't feel comfortable. She's said if it was anyone else it would be OK, but the fact I'm going out of my way for my ex frightens her. She asked me if I have feelings for Amy which I don't, but that didn't satisfy her and she said she wouldn't feel happy unless I stopped seeing Amy, which I said I wouldn't. I'm Amy's only friend. Why should I let her sit in that shithole all alone when I can be there just as a friend to help her through it?",False,False
1,"AITA for accidentally sitting in the wrong seat and delaying the switch to correct? | Yesterday I had a very early flight. When I paid for my ticket a few months ago I picked the window but I couldn't afford to guarantee it, which I new was tricky but I had to fly. I injured my arm and shoulder a few months ago and I was flying out to have surgery on it. I'm a really tall woman, I'm 6'4, even without the injury it takes me a hot minute to get settled in those small seats, with the shoulder my range of motion is further hindered. When I checked in I picked a window seat if available and got my ticket. It was early, I was really tired, I guess I just misread my ticket.

I got seated in the window seat of my row. A couple minutes later this guy came over and said I was in his seat and to move. I checked our tickets and saw he was right so I apologized. However, knowing how long it takes me to move, and seeing how long the line behind him was, I suggested he sit in the middle or aisle just until the line had gotten seated then I'd be happy to move, apologizing once more for my mistake. I explained about my arm and how it takes me so long to move and that I didn't want to hold anyone up anymore. The guy didn't like it and called me a moron, an idiot, stupid, for misreading the ticket. I was a little embarrassed so I contorted myself out of the seat and while I was moving I put my carry-on in the empty aisle seat. A note about my carry-on: it complied with Economy Class standards, more than fit in the tester compartment at check-in, and I even got approval from a flight attendant. It has some necessary sundries so I'm willing to sacrifice foot space.

Anyway, as he was getting seated and saw me do this he accused me of now trying to steal someone else's seat and called me the worst kind of person. I apologized again and sat down in the middle seat (my correct seat) and put my bag between my feet. As he got settled he made sure to bump and knock me as hard as possible, which he then complained that I was doing to him. We taxied third in line and got de-iced, taking off thirty-five minutes later and the whole time we were waiting for wheels up he complained to me about having ruined this whole flight for my mistake. I didn't say anything because at this point I'd apologized several times and I was getting pissed. Once we took off he kept staring at me so finally I snapped ""what?!"" and he told me the aisle seat was free and I needed to move so he didn't have to look at me anymore.

That pissed me off even further and since he made such a big deal about sitting in assigned seats I decided to forgo any comforts the aisle might give me and stayed right there in the middle seat for the whole flight, which I could tell was upsetting him, so I took some small glee. I don't think my mistake was that big; I admitted to it and agreed to fix it, offering what I thought was a reasonable suggestion so everyone was happy.

1,"AITA for blaming my roommate for betrayal? | I really don't know where to start. It's hard to even write about this. I started studying at the university last year in August, after a year's break.

I was proud because I was the first in my family to study on university level. My parents were not so lucky, they immigrated from Turkey to the US and gave me the conditions they did not have.

Once I started studying, the same year in September, I lost my dad. Mom (45F) struggled but did her utmost to keep on going.

My mother visited me several times at the university. I live there and share the apartment with my roommate Bill. I never had a close contact with the guy, he is two years older than me and our room was the only joint we had.

But approximately a month ago on January this year, Bill approached me and told me that my mother was hitting on him and he asked me to put an end to it. I was surprised, but I still thought that my mom was just feeling lonely, and nothing romantic going on.

Later, at the beginning of this month, he approached me once again and told me that my mom was still hitting on him. He then explained that it excites him and he gets turned on by it. According to him he hasn't made a move all this time out of respect for me and that he wanted to give me a chance to handle the situation.

I still couldn't believe him because my mom is a attractive and beautiful woman and that she was not capable of such activites. And that Bill isn't much of a attractive guy. I did not act and forgot all about it.

A few days ago, I found out that my mom and Bill had been sleeping with each other. I confronted Bill and he accused me for not doing anything, he blamed me and it felt crap to hear him say that. I really regret it, I should have taken it seriously. I met my mom in the family house, she didn't even want to talk, she completely ignored me. I'm hurt and shocked.

I have been home since I found out, but I get the news from other friends that my mom is still visiting and they have seen her with Bill a few times. I don't know if they are still sleeping with each other or if they are together. I feel like my world have been turned upside down.

I feel betrayed and I feel like my father was also betrayed. I blame Bill for everything.

0,"AITA for wanting to tell off my niece's elementary school teacher? | **TL;DR** Niece's teacher took an instrument that I lent my niece for repair without authorization, shop repaired it, and I might as well just have lit $30 on fire.  

I lent my niece my old clarinet for her music classes in elementary school. My thought process into it was that it would save my sister time, money, and not dealing with a music store. Before sending my niece off with said instrument for school, I had to fix the tenon cork on it. While that repair didn't go 100% as planned, the cork held the joints together as I assembled and disassembled it multiple times to test my repair. It was solid enough to make it to the weekend and I would have more time then to redo the tenon cork so that it would be fixed correctly.  

Yesterday I ask my niece how things went to be told that my clarinet ""fell apart"" and that her teacher was taking it to get it fixed. No contact was made by the teacher to my sister to verify what protocol was being followed to fix the clarinet. My sister reaches out to the teacher to tell her that my sister or I would be handling any repair and in return gets an e-mail back with quotes from a local music store that they work with for replacing the tenon cork ($60) and a tune up ($220).  

Today I made calls to determine who I want to do the work. My decision gets made on how I felt my interaction over the phone with the one shop went and by a few of their reviews on Google. My sister sends me a text message later in the day with the address of the store that the teacher took it to. Upon arriving at said store, they cannot find the clarinet. I get told that it was taken to their other location after they made a phone call and get handed the phone to which the owner of the store is on the line. I inform him that my niece's teacher had no authorization for repairs and I was there to collect my instrument to find out that they already started the repair and would write it off as goodwill if money was an issue.  

I explain to him that I wanted to be the one to decide what repair shop it went to and the repairs would be in my name for any type of workmanship guarantee. He continues to tell me that they work with families that have difficulty of paying. I explain to him that is not the situation for me and will pay for the work as I'm not out to screw someone out of time and money.  

My original cost of fixing my clarinet went from $13 and DIY to $73 and a shop doing it due to my niece's teacher taking it to the music store and assumptions being made. The area we live in has inflated prices which the reason on why I wanted to choose where it went. The place that I had decided on, wanted $30, stated the repair was not time consuming, and could have it back next business day.

1,"WIBTA If I don’t get my niece a birthday present? | This post is probably going to be longer than it needs to be.

My niece will be turning six in 4 days. She’s a great kid and I love her, but she’s at the tattling age. I’m 18 and I smoke weed but my parents are NOT okay with this. 

The last time my sisters boyfriend was over, my niece saw me and him go outside and watched us out the window. When I came back in, she called my mom and told her I was outside smoking with a proud smug look on her face. Nothing happened to me or anything, but smoking is a serious tension point in my family and my mom has even threatened to take away my college education because of it. After this I told her that telling on people for something they could get in trouble for is not cool and remembered her how many times she’s messed up or broke something and I covered for her. She seemed remorseful somewhat.

Well cut around to yesterday, I had the house to myself parent free. Went out back, lit up, and enjoyed myself. Successfully made it back to my room without being spotted by my niece. Everything was going well. Then she came in to tell me something and said “it smells like smoke in here... and I’m telling”. I guess my clothes still smelt like smoke from outside or something. And to top things off, I literally just asked her like 4 hours ago before this happened what she wanted for her birthday.

1,"AITA for not wanting to sign a prenup? And being pissed at my GF for lying by omission? | Yes I know she posted her side of it. But I'd like to get my own feedback on all of this. So please indulge me Reddit.

 I've (27m) been dating my girlfriend (20f) ""E"" for just over two years now. And tonight I finally popped the big question. I was positively thrilled and then E dropped a gigantic truth bomb. Turns out my sweet, loving, gentle, smart girlfriend that works a $16 an hour job as a fire watch at our local plants is worth somewhere in the ballpark of 200 million USD. And she wants me to sign a prenup before she will even consider walking down the aisle. 

Initially, I was positively floored by this revelation. But once the shock wore off I started to get angry and upset because it feels like E doesn't trust me enough to have told me before now. E adamantly swears this isn't the reason and that it's because she doesn't even have access to it yet so for her the money, is a nonfactor in daily life so she just doesn't think about it. But I to me it's like come on how could that substantial amount of money just slip your mind? 

I told her it felt like she didn't trust me and lied by keeping me in the dark about all of this. And that her asking me to sign a prenup just cements those feelings even more. She apologized though maintained that it wasn't done out of malice in any way shape or form. That the prenup is to protect us both in case we obe day go our separate ways. We shouldn't need a paper to say we won't do x, y, and z. We should just be adults and not do it. 

I feel like she is sabotaging us though by saying these things. Like shes already expecting me to fuck her over. Which I would absolutely never do. E doesn't and says that she's just being practical. I know I'm a blue-collar welder and all but that does not mean I am someone who would be untrustworthy and or just date her for the money she will get one day. 

I'm between a rock and a hard place here because if shes lied about this through omission then what else is could she be lying about. E thinks I am overreacting and an AH. I disagree though and feel she is for not trusting me, enough to open up and share with me. And because she kept me in the dark about this portion of her life.

1,"AITA for wanting to keep responsible control of my family's finances? |  To make a long story short, I didn’t know the whole picture of my wife’s financial situation until after we got married. Nearly 20k in school debt, 3k in personal credit card debt, 14k owed on a car, and her credit score had tanked into the 600s due to “forgetting” to pay medical bills that went to collections due to her moving around so much and not keeping on top of them. I was tremendously upset and ended up giving her an ultimatum—give me full financial control or I leave. She agreed and since then her paycheck has gone into our “family account”, which is solely in my name, but viewable and completely transparent to her. Every month I go over our finances and pull out a very generous allowance, which I load onto a debit card for her. 

This arrangement has worked *perfectly* for *years*. She has asked in the past about changing our situation, and I’ve always been clear that if she could demonstrate good financial skills, I’d be willing to revisit out agreement. But she complains that it’s “too hard to save” for the basic bookkeeping classes our local community college offers and that I’m not giving her enough ideas (??) for what else to do. Hardly a glowing example of her money skills, especially since her allowance is just being spent on non-essentials the kids don’t need and Starbucks and other meaningless things. 

Since she got a promotion and out-earns me, I’ve heard a never-ending barrage of pleas but no real plans of action proving she can handle this adult responsibility. Since I’ve been handling the finances, we’ve met all our financial goals and then some. Overall she says she won’t even be happy with a bigger allowance, she wants “full equal control of the family finances”, which is a clearly terrible plan. The last time she had “full control” of her finances, she racked up nearly 40k in debt!!!!!

The big tipping point has been that she wants to buy a bigger house, and I had to put my foot down. We don’t NEED more space, our girls don’t NEED their own bedrooms, and we don’t NEED to keep up with the Joneses. This is purely materialism, and at the heart it honestly sort of disgusts me that she’s making this into such a huge issue. I recently reached out to my brother to get some outside perspective, and he told me that he thinks not only am I the one in the wrong, I should be “groveling on the ground for forgiveness”.

The only person I told, and this was a mistake in retrospect, was my sister. Who was understanding at the time but I guess she flat out told my mother. Our relationship with my mother was strained for a long time but I *thought* we reconciled and they accepted our decision then to terminate the pregnancy.

This next part will probably sound stupid to you all but I felt immense guilt for disappointing my mother by having an abortion. The unreasonable part of me wanted to make it up to her, and the unreasonable course of action was to have another child. I became pregnant again much to the delight of my mother and my unreasonable thought process was I was making it up to her. I expressed to my family we weren't fully ready to have another child but we figured it'd follow the old adage ""it takes a village"" and we'd get ample help from my parents. My mother flat out told me it's the right thing to do and she'd babysit whenever we wanted because she's retired.

To make things short, we had our second child, a son, and my family completely left our lives. Straight up moved away, closed their Facebooks, never spoke to us again. Before this, she said it's punishment for having the abortion previously and that we're not part of the family anymore and we're on our own. My support system went to zero in a matter of weeks. Even my sister was on board and ghosted us 100%.

We now have a 2 and a half year old daughter and a 9 month old son. My marriage is beginning to get strained. We weren't ready for a second child and honestly, I'm not sure we ever really wanted more than one. My husband works full time and I had to relent to becoming a SAHM because we have no support system anymore. I wouldn't call our lives miserable but it's close.

I broached the topic to my husband of maybe putting our son up for adoption, so he can be raised in a better household. Not only that, but maybe our marriage would repair itself, our daughter can have a better undivided life, and we can continue on our original path of just having one child. My husband is conflicted and said to give him a few months to work on us and if we can make it work, he'd like to keep both children as he loves them both. But I think deep down we all know things are in disarray now.

1,"AITA for not wanting to adopt my sister in law when my wife and I were already planning on adopting? | On a throwaway because I really don’t want this situation connected to my main account. I’ll also try to add a lot of details because my family is pretty split with this situation and we don’t know what to do.


My wife right now is currently 24. Her mom waited a while before having a second child, so my wife’s little sister is now 13.


My wife and I have always wanted a child, and we have decided to have one, MAYBE two. But most likely one. We talked about it and decided to adopt a baby in the future for two reasons. One, we want to give a  baby a new home, and two, my wife has some fertility issues that won’t make producing a child impossible, but very difficult.


I’d like to point out that we were not planning on adopting a baby now, or in the near near future. We don’t feel financially stable enough and we still want time with each other without a kid for a little while longer. We thought about adopting in our early-mid 30s.


So a couple of weeks ago, my MIL started having multiple health issues. She wasn’t expected to pass really soon, but we have been advised to get all of her stuff in order, just in case worse comes to worse. One issue that we’re having is that my MIL wants us to adopt my wife’s little sister when she passes. She believes that we are the best do to it because the girl’s father has already passed, our immediate family is either too old (like in their 40s and don’t want to “start over” raising a child), or simply not able to raise a child, we are supposedly around the perfect age to bring in a child, and we were already planning on adopting.


My wife and I thought about it for a long time and came to the conclusion that we didn’t feel ready to adopt her little sister. Unfortunately, my MIL’s condition was starting to worsen a little bit quicker than we expected, so the issue was becoming more urgent. When we told her that we didn’t feel comfortable taking on that job right now, she started crying and calling us names. She also said something along the lines of “how dare you live your perfect life with your husband while your little sister, your own flesh and blood could end up in the system” to my wife. This really upset her and I had to calm her down when we got off the phone.


We would be fine with keeping her for a little while, but we just don’t simply feel ready to have a new teenager in the household.


Other family members have heard about the situation and some are calling us selfish for not being willing to struggle to keep somebody in the family, and some can see our side. My wife obviously feels terrible about this. She truly loves her sister but doesn’t think she can care for her correctly. Are we TAs here?",False,False
0,"AITA for being upset at my friend for dating my ex | A year ago we broke up. She moved out of my place.  I had a buddy of mine over the day she did it so I had some support when she left. When she left she back right into his car and damaged the bumper. A year later he finally contacts her to get it fixed. Apparently they started to hangout after. Yesterday he messaged me to inform me that they are going on a date in a few days. I replied back that I respected him for telling me that and that I will be taking a step back from being his friend. I wished him luck with her and stop replying.

1,"WIBTA for leaving my stepdaughter behind? | We are not from an English speaking country, sorry for mistakes.

So long story short I married a woman who previously had a child. The father was not in a picture since she got pregnant since he didn’t want the child to be born. My wife left the kid to grow up with her mother (child’s grandmother), so she could go to the city and work. The kid is currently 13 years old. She didn’t live with us until 2 years ago. We moved her from the village, so she can get better education (she’s a bright kid). She’s a pretty quiet and shy kid around us, and she mostly does her own things with her new friends. She does get jealous of me though when it comes to her mother quite a lot to the point that I feel like she purposefully creates conflict, so my wife and I fight and she would get to spend the night with my wife (since my wife would go and sleep with out daughter instead). Our relationship feels cold and I can’t connect to her. Recently I’ve learned that I got an opportunity to move to another country for a better job. My wife is happy about the prospects, but I am not sure if it would be wise to bring the child along. We already don’t have a good relationship, and I feel like she would be better off with staying with her biological grandmother. WIBTA for suggesting to leave her behind?",False,False
1,"AITA for snapping at a woman who woke me up on the train because I was snoring? | I (22F) live in the suburbs and commute to my job in a city. It’s about a 50 minute train ride. There is one quiet car that I never sit in. I normally sleep on the train and I’ve never had a problem until today. This morning, I was sleeping when I felt someone touching my shoulder. I woke up and this middle-aged woman was smiling at me. 

Obviously, I was confused so I stared at her for a second until she said, “You were snoring.” It was weird because she didn’t seem upset or annoyed about it, she was smiling and friendly. I said, “So what?” She seemed kind of taken aback and told me that she just wanted me to know. So I said, “I really don’t care, let me sleep in peace.” I admit that I definitely was pissed off when I said this. She said that there was no need to be rude about it. That’s when I really got pissed and said, “are you fucking serious? You’re the rude one. Leave me alone.” She didn’t say anything but I was too wired to sleep so i just played on my phone for a very awkward 20 minutes. 

I told my coworkers what happened and they said that while she shouldn’t have woke me up, I escalated the situation. Obviously i disagree and think she was the rude one here. So i wanted another opinion. Thanks.",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I made a big deal about my sister using my middle name for her kids? | My older sister is getting ready to have kids. She’s talked about baby names and I was surprised to hear her plans. 

A little background: i got my middle name from my mom. My older sister has her own original first and middle names and I was given my mom’s middle name as my middle name. To clarify, let’s say my mom’s middle name is Alice. My sister is not named after Alice. My middle name is Alice. I know from previous conversations that I got Alice because my parents couldn’t think of anything they liked and my aunt suggested passing down the middle name.

I have always had intentions on passing Alice as my first daughter’s middle name. I don’t know if my sister knows this. She wants to name her first girl something like Haley Alice Lastname but definitely Alice for the middle name. This BOTHERS me. 

I know it may be petty but I need to decide if I’m going to let this bother me or not. It my name; it’s not her name. She’s older and my parents chose her name on simply names they liked—no family names were passed down. I got an unoriginal middle name but it’s my moms and I take pride it was passed down to me—even though it’s because they couldn’t come up with something else.

I understand that my sister’s kid would be getting her grandmothers middle name passed down to her (my sister and I obviously have the same parents) but it feels weird to me to plan on having a three generation tradition on my side that my sister kinda jumped onto. And the thing is—she’s 100% going to have kids before I do and I don’t know how ‘entitled’ I am to my name. I am irrationally upset about this and I know bringing it up will be enough to cause problems with/for my sister.

1,"AITA for wanting to move out of my boyfriend's house because his mom makes me nanny his little siblings? | Okay, a little bit of background here. Up until about a month ago, I (17F) lived at home until my mom kicked me out if the house after finding out I was pregnant with my boyfriend's baby. (Really wild that I took so long to show,, I was 5 months) 

Anyway, my boyfriend convinced his family to let me live with them until he and I figured out a better arrangement. We're both seniors now but I stopped going to school because that place was a dumpster fire and I was doing badly anyway because of hormones and stuff.

He's graduating soon, plans to move out with what he saved to start up, and then go to college. He has a part time job that pays minimum so his family covers both of our expenses for the most part.

I'm grand for the most part because I have a roof over my head and food and my doctor's appointments are regular. His dad is okay, not really in the picture but he helps with finances.

My boyfriend has 2 little kid siblings. One 9M and another 7F. So, they used to get a sitter wherever their mom has to be out. But since having me in the house, their mom started to treat me like a live in home sitter. I am absolutely, absolutely fine with doing chores. But, his little brother has been recently a handful. I'm 6 months pregnant and I'm huge and starting to have mobility issues. This little brother regularly throws tantrums which his mom makes me deal with. He mostly just screams his head off and is non violent but he demands that I bathe him and his mom just tells me to deal with it. It's starting to get harder as I'm getting bigger. Riskier too because I'm scared of slipping. Dealing with him emotionally and physically drains me and I don't think I can deal with this until my boyfriend could move out esp when I have a newborn around. 

Because of this, I asked my boyfriend if I could move out ahead of time, the rent would be covered by my godmother as an apology for not being able to take me in i suppose. She said she could pay as long as I needed it and i could pay here back later. Sounds really impossible but Im fine with living tight for myself as long as my baby is provided for.

Problem is my boyfriend's mom doesn't want me to leave and when asked why she says I'm being ungrateful for even attempting that.

1,"AITA for traveling while my wife is pregnant? | My wife is 6 months pregnant. We were planning to travel but our plans got cancelled because she was scared of traveling. I don’t think canceling the trip was necessary but it is what it is. 

She has been driving me crazy for the past months. I understand the hormonal changes during pregnancy but it’s extremely annoying. She told me she can’t stand the smell of cigarettes (I smoke) so she refuses to be around me. We rarely hang out and she always eats alone. Even though I have stopped smoking around her 

I grew really tired of her so last month I decided I was going on a trip to Vegas with my friends in July. She was pissed and says I’m being an asshole. Apparently she needs me around but we barely hang out together.

0,"AITA for supporting my aunt after she cheated on my uncle? | To start this off, I want to say that cheating is NEVER the answer in a relationship. I think it's awful and if things are bad enough to cheat it's either time to break it off or talk through things. 

So I found out recently from my mother that my aunt was kicked out and is now living with my grandma after my uncle caught her talking to another man. Normally, I'd be ashamed of anyone in my family had done something like that, but the thing is my uncle is kind of a piece of work with a serious ego problem. Nobody on our side of the family enjoy his presence and we dread every holiday gathering he shows up to. He's extremely condescending and has a major superiority complex. 

To top all this off, about 8 years ago, said uncle said he found himself after joining the Catholic Church. We all sort of hoped this would help him realize that his pride was a problem, but it only added fuel to the fire. He made his household into the ""classic"" family structure making my aunt become a stay at home mom and he began making all the household decisions. It didn't change much at first, but over time he became pretty controlling over my aunt and cousins. So much so that when my cousin graduated from high school she told me she was excited to get away from her dad. 

From what I noticed, it really seemed like my aunt was just getting fed up about no longer being able to live her own life after years of him manipulating her to become entirely dependent on him and his income. She and my cousins started disregarding him more and more often. After he caught her talking to someone else, he immediately packed her bags and told her to get out, then proceeded to call multiple family members to inform everyone of what she did. 

Like I said, I don't condone cheating, but I feel that my aunt was really just stuck between a rock and a hard place and didn't know how to handle it. He married into the family a little bit before I was born and everyone's wanted him gone since. My aunt has always been the one in the family that does the right thing and does what she's told (by my grandma and later her husband too). My mother and I are totally backing my aunt on this, but a lot of our family is telling us that we're in the wrong and shouldn't ""encourage her behavior"". AITA here?",False,False
1,"AITA for allowing my dad to have a relationship with his grandson? | My dad was a horrible father and had no business raising children. I don't want to get into the details but it wasn't like my father did not know about some of the things that went on or wasn't around growing up. He just seemed on making his kids as fucked up as he was and he succeeded. One brother is in jail, one is a raging alcoholic, one is a tweaker and there is me. I largely escaped him because my mother raised me (my siblings all have different moms but we're raised by our father). My father main abuse towards me had to do with my being gay even though he's not homophobic at heart. He's just a really bad parent.

My son is 3 and I've allowed my dad to have a relationship with him. My family are outraged by this. My father is a horrible dad but he's actually a good grandpa. I know he will never hurt my son and TBH my son is the only person that my father has any kind of relationship with. I feel bad for my father because he had a shitty life and is now in his 70s, poor health, no money and no family or friends (unless you count his pug). My son loves spending time with him and he cries when he leaves.
My dad would ever abuse his grandkids. My siblings are angry over what he put them through and preventing any relationship between their kids and him is their way of getting even. I'm not saying they're right or wrong. I just understand their viewpoint but they don't understand mine. My dad was an awful parent but excellent grandparent.

I’m not going to lie, I have been acting different towards her and I feel bad. I have always been attracted to her bubbly personality and she is a sweetheart, but most recently after going on a trip with her friends she did an impromptu head shave. She has been mentioning that she wants to shave her head over the last couple of months, and I didn’t support it. I understand it’s her body and her choice, but for some reason I just can’t accept it. I still love her but sometimes it seems that she does these sort of things to maintain a sort of “wildcard” type in her friends group. She can clearly tell that I am acting different. By different, I mean that I’m acting more distant. Sorry if I sound immature, but this is just how I feel.

0,"AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend on the day of prom? | Now I know how this sounds, but hear me out before immediately saying I'm the asshole (even though I might be)

I had been dating my girlfriend for about a month, and although I had never officially asked her to prom at some point it was just unanimously decided that we would go together. However, I kind of stopped feeling affection for her about a week before prom. It's not that I disliked her, I just realized that our personalities weren't really compatible in a romantic sense. However, I didn't want to be a dick and dump her on the day of prom, so I decided I would just stick it out and break up with her a few days after.

The problem is, she must have noticed I was acting off because, about 3 or 4 hours before prom, she texted me saying (and this is as close to a word for word quote as I can remember) ""Glenttastic if you're going to break up with me please just do it before prom, otherwise it won't be fun for either of us."" Naturally I freaked the fuck out and didn't know what to do. I responded with ""maybe we should just go together as friends"" (but understandably she avoided me most of the night).

0,"AITA for bringing grapes into my friends house when he has a dog? | So I honestly didn’t think I was the asshole, but I have had some friends and my mom tell me I am.

I (F16) was over at my friend’s (M16) house for a study thing. Let’s call him Matt. So I was getting kind of hungry because we had just ended school, and I had some grapes left over from lunch. (He was eating a granola bar, so it wasn’t like I was the only one eating). 

He then looked at my grapes and just went, “ are you kidding me right now, I have a fucking dog!” 
“Do you know what happens when dogs eat grapes, throw that shit away”. 

I just put it back in my bag because I didn’t want to waste them, and planned to eat them later. He got even more upset because I refused to throw them away.

I didn’t think anything was wrong with it, because while the dog was in the room, I wasn’t feeding, or even offering any to the dog. And it wasn’t like I was dropping them everywhere either. But I told my mom when I got home, and she called me selfish for not thinking of my friends dog, and told me I should have never brought grapes in the house, and should have thrown them away when he asked.

0,"AITA for enabling my wife's drug use? | My wife had bad PPD after our first was born two years ago and was on antidepressants for a long time. If she stopped taking them, she'd fall into a deep depression and our relationship suffered. A mutual friend suggested some research chemicals to her and my wife gave it a try. She uses 4-aco-dmt, as far as I understand an analog for psilocybin mushrooms.

She did it once and stopped taking her antidepressants and she was fine. She was fine for about two months before it slowly began to creep back into her life. So she took 4-aco-dmt again, and again, her anxieties and stresses were gone for months. She never kept this from me, she was open and honest about it. And she has no desire to try any other drug or research chemical.

Now once every 3-4 months, she'll take a day to herself while I manage our child the whole day and she'll just take this drug. Her dose is about $10 every 3-4 months when antidepressants were costing us hundreds a month. And she's fine: she's no different than if she were on antidepressants, in fact, it looks like she's doing better than ever on them. Her behavior hasn't changed, her mood is improved. Honestly I feel like this drug does whatever antidepressants do but last a lot longer.

So far nothing bad has happened of it, but obviously self medicating is a risky thing in and of itself. I've been enabling her because I know the benefit it's providing to her and by extension our relationship.

I broached the topic to a friend who can keep things in confidence and he thinks I'm an asshole for enabling her drug use. Even if I explain it all as I have in this thread, he thinks *I'm* being abusive by condoning it. Some part of me does feel slimy, but if it works, it works, right?

I was home for the break and working forty plus hours at a high stress job with unpredictable shifts. My uncle (who was the benefactor of some of her property) came in while I at work from a double and began throwing things away, somethings that were even my property. We're talking several hundred dollars worth of stuff and he said he would pay me back. He hasn't done that. Long story short, we got in an argument and he hired me a babysitter (I'm a legal adult) to watch me while I was there. (Fight was about me 'not clearing' my work schedule with him). I moved out and proceeded to be told that he would no longer be be following our grandma's wishes for some property that she wanted for me. 


He invited our family members during this argument to watch and they proceeded to harass my stepmom before she had surgery.

0,"AITA For not immediately cleaning up after we finished eating? | My boyfriend cooked dinner for us, and we sat and ate together. As we finished eating, he said “okay, can you clean up now?” I told him I’d rather wait a few minutes, chill out and digest; I don’t like cleaning up the whole kitchen the moment I’ve finished eating. (And before anyone jumps to conclusions, this is true, not just an excuse to not clean. I always clean up when it’s my turn.) 

He says he wants it clean now because the mess makes him uncomfortable, and he’ll help me if we do it now. But I say that it’s okay, I’m happy to do all the cleaning by myself, I just want to relax for a minute beforehand. 

So, he sighs dramatically and goes “fine, I’ll just do it by myself” and starts cleaning. I shrug and go to the bathroom, and when I come back he gives me a glare and pointedly ignores me, so I say “I don’t appreciate you being passive aggressive just because I didn’t clean everything the exact moment you wanted me to.” It felt like being a teenager, where my mother would pull things just like this.

1,"AITA for not raising a fuss about refusing to answer a question on a scholarship search the way my mom wanted? | This happened a long time ago and before I went to college obviously.

I was brought up Catholic but am not today and wasn't as a teenager either. This caused some conflict but by the time I was applying to colleges my mom had accepted it and said she wouldn't raise a fuss about my ruling out applying to any Catholic colleges (which to be honest wasn't really an act of defiance as I didn't apply to any private colleges period, but I made a point of not applying to Catholic ones while I just didn't apply to any private ones because I would never be able to afford them.) She also promised to not ask me to attend Mass in college, which she didn't though she did mention I could go to non-Catholic student church groups, though I never did.

There was however a point of conflict involving it. One night my mom asked me to register with a website that would alert me of any scholarships I'd qualify for. It asked demographic questions. All was fine until it came to religion. My mom said ""please don't put down atheist"" (note: I never intended to or thought of doing so before she made that comment. I wasn't really an atheist then.)

I told her I wasn't going to out down Catholic so fine, I'd put down Lutheran (my dad's side of the family. I tolerated it more than Catholicism.) My mom raised a fuss that I wouldn't qualify for any Lutheran scholarships since I was never actively enrolled in a Lutheran church and asked me to answer Catholic just for the scholarship eligibility. 

This made me furious. I wasn't going to sell out my principles even for a scholarship. I raised a fit asking how the fuck could I qualify for a Catholic scholarship, especially as I had zero church involvement and would never write an essay about it. My mom eventually conceded on this but it was a heated argument. I accused her of still trying to impose that on me even though she promised me I wouldn't. She said it was just a short sighted attempt to maximize potential scholarships but admitted now it was futile, I'd never qualify for any Catholic scholarship. After about an hour I pointed out the ""I would prefer not to respond"" option for the question and my mom said to just choose that. 

I've wondered since college if I was a huge asshole for that and not just humoring her. Or perhaps just instead saying ""no, I will not answer ""Catholic"""", choosing that option I did and moving on with no argument. 

(Note: I ended up not qualifying for any scholarships which is hardly surprising but makes the whole thing kind of a waste.)",False,False
1,"AITA for calling my friend's mother a ""MILF"" around him? | So my friend has a mother (who he currently lives with) who in our social group is known for being very attractive, she's early 40s (she had him kind of young), looks about a decade younger and every guy I've ever talked to who's seen her agrees she's incredibly attractive. She's single too. My friend seems to get annoyed whenever someone else sees him with her and says something like ""wow dude your mom is so hot! Last time I was at his place playing video games I was talking about how I'm single now and said something like ""I totally would be fine dating the MILF who also lives here!"" He got very uncomfortable and told me to never use that term to describe his mother again.

1,"AITA for leaving my friend alone outside the club? | Last night I (22F) went out with two friends (let's call them V and S, both 23F) , to watch a DJ play at a local club.

We met up outside the club around midnight, and there was a very long line already. After 15 minutes we realised that we wouldn't get in, so we considered leaving for another club nearby. But me and S were super keen on seeing this DJ, so we started talking to the security guard who was standing by the backdoor, trying to get  him to sneak us in.

He eventually decided that he would let me and S in, because we had prepaid tickets, but not V, because she didn't have a prepaid ticket. I felt really bad for V, but we went inside anyways. I tried to get the guard to let her in, but he wouldn't.

1,"AITA for being mad at my parents for getting a dog? | Throwaway.

I will make this quick.

All growing up, I wanted a dog. My parents always said ""no"" because they don't want to take care of a dog. My mom always said if I want a dog, I can wait until I am self-sufficient. Ok. Fine.

I went to college, did well, no problem finding a good job, and was able to move out of my parents house relatively quickly after graduating. All in all, I've been on my own for over 3 years now, and got a dog as soon as I could.

Lo and behold, my parents (specifically my mom) just decided to adopt a middle-aged dog.  I was pissed because I asked for a dog for forever and no? I'm glad she adopted a dog that needed it, but really? I confronted her and she said she didn't want a dog while she was ""actively"" parenting. THEN she even implied my dog would not have been ok, anyway.  I don't want to get into a breed war, so basically she is uncomfortable around bigger dogs.

I told her she is a hypocrite, that i can't believe she's ok with getting a dog after being so adamant about not having one. My dad is telling me i hurt her feelings and wants me to apologize. I think i am justified in calling her out. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for refusing to do my mom’s chore? | Mandatory I’m on mobile warning. 

I’m a 20 year old female, finishing my last semester at American community college. I’m living at home. 

About a year ago, my mom (57) and dad did some minor touch ups to the kitchen. Added a dishwasher. Got a new fridge. New wall grout. Since fixing up the kitchen, my mom has been very intent on keeping the kitchen perfect. 

After dinner, me and my other siblings must wipe the table, wipe the counters, unload/reload the dishwasher, sweep the floor, clean the pots my mom used to make dinner, and other little chores like that. My parents were pretty rigid in making us do the chores. My mom says that since she cooks dinner, she shouldn’t clean up. (It should be added that the days I cook dinner I’m expected to clean up after dinner too.)

My siblings and I agreed. We’ve been spending 15-20 minutes after dinner cleaning up for about 6 months now. 

At dinner one night, we agreed on a consensus. My mom will run the dishwasher when she gets up in the morning. She’ll put a little detergent pod in the machine and hit run. Then, before dinner, she’ll empty out the dishwasher. Emptying out the dishwasher takes less than 5 minutes. 

Except, my mom doesn’t do this. She tells me to empty out the dishwasher. I have been emptying out the dishwasher for a week or two, but it makes me very upset that we agreed upon something, then she doesn’t execute her agreement. 

Today, she told me to empty out the dishwasher. I reminded her that it’s actually her job to empty out the dishwasher. She got mad and told me I can help her empty out the dishwasher. I told her she doesn’t help me when doing my chores. She got very mad at me then and began emptying out the dishwasher by herself.

1,"AITA for arguing with my grandmothers care worker and her boss? | My grandmother is 90 this year.
I'm 34 and SIL is 30.

My SIL visits my grandmother with her children and my brother three times a week, I visit as much as possible which is usually three times a month  but we usually Skype or call at least twice a week, I live further away so it just isnt possible for me to visit as frequently.

My SIL has always been very involved with the family, my brother has always tried to make everyone include her since she was adopted and her adopted family went no contact with her (they had a child of their own not too long after adopting her) 

I personally think sometimes SIL is overly involved, she's not actually family.

Apparently my grandmothers care worker asked her work to phone family to talk to my grandmother, apparently she was getting emotional when care worker went to leave because obviously nobody has been visiting as much.

Apparently instead of me being contacted (they have my number and brothers number) they contacted my brother despite me saying contact him only in emergencies if I'm not available.

SIL apparently spent 2 hours on the phone and only told me since grandma had asked where I was.

It's not like I'm low contact, I've specified to contact ME, SIL isnt actually her family and should've passed the message to call to me.

I called them up and complained as I should've been informed, not her.

My husband thinks I'm being pety but I think it was unprofessional on the care workers part and especially so on her boss.

Apparently I'm an AH for overreacting I don't think I overreacted and I'm actually considering changing her carer because I'm concerned about what else I'm not being informed about.

I set up the account and paid £1500 into it. She was aware that it was for her 18th or university or deposit for house....

Last weekend we had to go away on family business but she stayed at home as she had work the next day. We expressly said no parties, no boys otherwise her 18th party was cancelled.

Anyway she had a boy round, drank a couple of bottles of spirits and God knows what. She denied at first, however this kid posted photos on insta so we knew he was at our house and the daughter was drunk..

1,"WIBTA if I didn't tell my mom that my dad is cheating on her? | Throwaway for reasons.

Context: My parents have been married for 40 years, and while they've always been amazing and involved parents to me (29) and my sister (35), they haven't exactly been the shining example of an old couple in love. It's not that they get in particularly bad fights or anything disturbing/violent/traumatizing like that, but I think that at this point, while they still love each other, they have long fallen out of love. It doesn't really bother us. These things happen and we have no complaints about our relationship with our parents, individually and as a couple.

Recently, my dad and I went on a trip. I'm a light sleeper, and almost daily, I'd wake up at like 3am or so to my dad on the phone in the next room. It wasn't anything indecent, just him recounting his day, etc. But one phone call he ended with ""I love you"", which isn't really something my parents do. This isn't the first time my sister and I caught my dad though (seen texts on his phone, etc.), so we're both convinced that he's cheating on our mom.

To be honest, while I still think this is a dick move by our dad, I also kinda get why he does it. My mom and dad are such opposites that it's a wonder they even ended up together. My dad is one of those former golden boys. Alpha male, a total extrovert, and in constant want of emotional attention. My mom is this intellectual lady boss who pours her life and soul into three main areas: her children, her siblings, and her work. My dad is a far fourth, and she isn't affectionate at all toward him. Obviously, my dad's needs aren't met by my mom, but he's still a douche for going this route instead of dealing with it like an adult. Plus we're pretty sure that if my mom found out, most of her hurt/anger will not be because of a broken heart, but rather a wounded ego.

My sister and I agreed not to tell our mom about it. We think that literally no one would benefit from us doing so. They're both semi-retired now, and mom still gets fulfillment from her advocacy work while dad might get fulfillment from this. The result is a peaceful and fun family. I don't even think my dad actually meets up with the woman, as he's always driving mom around or at home. He's a devoted father and a very present husband, so I have no resentment toward him for letting his cheating get in the way of his family responsibilities.

Our parents have always been great parents to us, and never left us wanting emotionally, economically, etc., and as such, it isn't our place to throw this wrench onto their marriage. But I recently confided in a friend about this and they said it's an asshole move to not tell my mom this as she deserves to know the truth. Still, like I said, I honestly don't think anything is to gain from it, PLUS a part of us (my sister and I) think my mom already knows anyway, and as such, we don't want to force her to confront something she doesn't want to.

0,"AITA for telling my wife I don’t want to spend money on vacations anymore? | We’ve been married for 4 years, and every year we take a trip for vacation

But the problem is she gets nervous on trips, and every year is getting worse. First time her stomach was a little upset for a couple of days, which is normal.

Second time it was upset for half the time we were there

Third time it was pretty much everyday plus headches

The last time we went which was a few weeks ago, she got so sick, her throat was hurting, plus the upset stomach, migraines, it was a total disaster.

The thing is, she’s never sick at home, and every time we go to a different place, so it’s not the place, and it’s not a condition that she has.

At the same time that I understand she gets so nervous that her body reacts to it, we spend a lot of money on these trips, and specially on the last few ones, we dont enjoy it. Her because she is sick, and me because I take care of her and honestly feel bad for going enjoy myself and leaving her in the room

When we got back home she already started talking about where she wants to go next year. I told her that I thought for next year we should just got visit our families, that we were spending too much money in these expensive trips and in the end we were not enjoying it

When we go visit family she’s fine, cause it’s a known place, not too far, so nothing happens to her

She was a little upset and sad with my comment and asked  if we will never go on a trip again, I said we will, but maybe we should wait longer before taking the next one. She didnt like that at all, and said she can’t control it, I said I understand, but the money is still being spent, and she still gets sick, and I still get worried and take care of her, and none of us enjoy the trip.

We just went to an amazing resort in the Domenican Republic, and she pretty much spent 10 days in the room, while I went to the beach maybe 3 days for a hour each time. We ate at the restaurant twice, the rest of the time was room service.

We spent a ton of money for almost no enjoyment

A few days ago there was a car accident outside of my apartment building. This happens often as it is a busy intersection so I thought nothing of it. 

As I pulled into the lot I noticed that a lady was in my assigned spot in said lot. I pulled my car up behind her and kindly asked her to move her car. 

She explained to me that her daughter was one the driver of one of the cars in the accident and that the police had specifically told her to park in my spot. 

Well, I looked around the lot and noticed lots of empty reserved spots and wondered why a cop would tell her to park specifically in my spot. Never mind that there were multiple open spaces on the street. Needless to say I didn’t believe her. 

I explained to her that I pay for that spot and that if I parked in somebody else’s my car would potentially get towed. I even said that she was welcome to park in one of the other open spots or on the street. 

We got into a pretty heated argument which ended with me telling her that I’m going to call the towing company. She moved and gave me many nasty looks.

I sent out a class email with a homework assignment and made a misspelling. Some of my students decided to turn that misspelling into a dumb meme and post it on our class discussions page... without realizing I could see it. It got a little crude but nothing out of the ordinary for 18 year olds and nothing was directed at anyone in particular. I honestly found it kind of funny that they were making fun of me and my class (and other things, the meme ended up including things like Harry Potter jokes and the like) without realizing I could also see it.

I decided to address the issue that I would start that class by putting some screenshots of those memes on the projector. I said something along the lines of “I’m glad you all have finally utilized the class discussions feature, these are some interesting points that we can discuss now.” Of course they got embarrassed and we moved on. All the major meme makers apologized after but I told them it was no big deal and made sure to laugh it off so they didn’t think they were actually in trouble.

I told this story to my brother who is also a teacher and he accused me of public shaming and said that it was a terrible teaching method and that my students are probably still cut up about it.

I'm halfway watching my kid, halfway surfing net when I hear this noise of a 4 or 5-year-old: ""Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaahhhheeeee!""

On one hand, it was a sound of glee. On the other hand, it was about the loudest, sharpest, most obnoxious, out of control sound of glee imaginable. I won't say for certain that the little girl was making the noise just to be loud or to get attention, but it was one of those spine-cringing, blood curdling noises, even if it was a preschooler having the time of her life.

I thought her parents might say something as she continued doing it, and then again as she made the noise again, but louder and longer. ""WWWWWWWWAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAHHHEEEEEEEEEEEE!"" It was a screech, a long, nails-on-chalkboard-style screech. I couldn't believe no one was saying anything.

I waited, and again she let one out, it grew in volume, filling the whole gallery. I could feel the entire space cringing as this girl's parents did nothing. I finally had it. I stood up, walked over to the little girl, bent down on one knee, looked her straight in the eye and said, ""This is indoors. Could you please use a softer voice.""

Then I went to sit down. She stopped making the noise, but almost immediately after, her father stormed over to me, ""Why don't you let me parent my own child.""

She's had some credit card debt. Nothing major, but because her businesses' incomes have dried up, she hasn't had any way to pay her debts off. She's begun making hand sanitizers and face masks to generate some extra income, but she's always on the lookout for more cash to support the family.

A few months ago, she asked me if she could sell my old bike. I agreed, since I don't use it much anymore and it's just rusting in a corner of our storage. It took a while, but today, she was finally able to sell it, as well as my dad's bike.

I helped her to cart it out front and wiped it down before the buyer pulled up and paid for it. After the guy drove off and we went inside, I asked her for my share. She was bemused at first, and asked me who was the one who sold it in the first place. I said it was her, but it is still my bike and my property. She said she'd give me half. I disagreed, and asked her for the full amount as I also need money since I'm saving to move out  sooner than later. I didn't mention the moving out part. That's a sore subject for her.

I told her that and she said, no, you kept saying how much you loved it so I offered to get you one made. I said, “Yeah but for Mother’s Day, I never assumed you wanted me to pay you for it.” She said that she would’ve just gotten it as surprise if she meant for it to be a gift.

It’s also very draining because lining up for the tourist sights is already exhausting and long enough.

In October of last year, I completed the Hacktoberfest challenge, a popular yearly challenge for programmers in which participants recieve a free T shirt along with a few stickers for their contribution.

My package arrived today and my oblivious mother asked what it was. I explained and opened it in front of her and my brother suddenly threw a fit about how he's not getting anything. My mother straight away said to him ""sure, you can have the stickers as the T shirt probably won't fit you""

I straight away said "" That's mine and I'm not sharing, I earned this by participating in the challenge. I have uses for those stickers"" (The stickers would end up on my old laptop)

My brother threw a tantrum and after I refused to budge, left the room. My mother gave me a huge lecture on how I must be more considerate towards him and should learn to share with him because he was having a tough day. I still refused to share and walked to my room.

He's casually talked about getting more every so often, though in the 9 years we've been together he hasn't, and any time it comes up and he asks what I think, I do let him know I don't like the idea of him getting more tattoos, but ultimately it's his choice. I won't be mad about it, but I'm not going to share his excitement.


Anyways, so he finally decided he's ready to get more... and he wants to get writing on his arm saying ""CREAM Git dat money $$$"" and his hands to say ""THERE IS"" and ""NO GOD"" with devil horns on one side and an upside cross on the other. I'm not gunna lie, I absolutely thought he was joking. At first I was like haha, very funny, so what do you want to get? And... yeah. That's it, apparently. I was so shocked I couldn't even say anything for a minute. For context, we do live in a more upper class area, but a smaller town, and while yes people have tattoos here, absolutely not something like that. He would stand out like a sore thumb, and honestly so would I, and while it may be shallow I'd rather my boss and coworkers not know me as the lady married to the dude with GIT DAT MONEY$$$ tattooed on him.


I was, and I admit, maybe a little too brutally honest. I told him, ""I know you want tattoos and all but... that's a horrible idea. Honestly it's really stupid and immature and I would be embarrassed to be seen around you if you really got that."" He told me I was crazy, that those are awesome ideas and he loves those sayings, and that he doesn't see what my problem is. I told him my problem is that that's something a wannabe gangster teenage would tattoo on his arm to try and act cool.


He got pretty upset and said he put alot of thought into this and it wasn't cool of me to tear him down like that, and even if I don't like it I should be supportive. I don't see any way I could support it whatsoever. It's a horrible idea and I am completely against it. AITA for being so harsh about it though?

0,"AITA for telling my sister that she should have stayed in the hospital for Christmas? | My sister has an eating disorder she’s been battling for the past year. She has been in the hospital for a couple of weeks but was released to come home last week. I have to admit, her being in hospital was actually a nice change. No screaming, no crying at meal times, and my parents could actually focus on me for a change. 

We were supposed to go to my uncle’s house for Christmas, but my parents didn’t think going on a long car ride would be a good idea for my sister, so we’re just doing Christmas at home. And my sister has been insufferable. She is obviously not recovered because she’s still crying over every meal she has to eat, and is freaking out over the large Christmas dinner. I told her that if she’s still this afraid of food, maybe she shouldn’t have left the hospital, which just caused her to cry more. And I feel awful for saying it, because she was miserable in the hospital, but at the same time, it’s tough to be around her when she’s so miserable. AITA?",False,False

I say that I didn't realize she was upset and I obviously didn't mean anything by it and I'm sorry she took it the wrong way, I'll talk to her. Friend tells me apologizing because ""you took it that way"" is not the right reason to apologize. I tell friend I would apologize because I never meant to upset them, and I feel bad for that.

1,"AITA for not letting my estranged sister back in my life? | My  oldest sister has always been an angry person. She can be smart and  nice when she wants to be but growing up she was always fighting with my mom and she tried to run away a few times. She was mean to me too  because she was jealous of me. My mom and I always get along well and we're best friends now. My sister hates me because she thinks my mom loves me more than her. Maybe if she was nicer to my mom, they would get along better.

4 years ago, she cut everyone out of her life. She cut my mom out first because she thought that my mom wasn't a good mother to her then she cut me and my siblings out because we defended my mom and told her that she was being immature. We were firm with her and she didn't like it. My mom is not a perfect person. She had my sister when she was very young and she was a little ignorant when it came to parenting. But we all forgave her except my sister.  My mom is a better person now and I love her. My sister won't let go of the past and she kept confronting my mom about things that happened 20 years ago. My mom just ignored her because she was being nasty but it pissed off my sister even more. I wish she would get over it and move on. We all did, but she chose to stay in the past.

My  mom is devastated. She cries all the time over my sister and holidays have been very hard for her. She misses my sister a ton and she always wonders what my sister is doing and what her life is like now. She reached out to my sister last year, but my sister told her that she moved on and she ""felt safe"" without my mom in my life. It's such a cruel and wretched thing to say and it destroyed my mom even more.

Yesterday  I randomly got an email from my sister. It was long-winded and filled with self pity. She claimed that my mom abused her and made her the ""family scapegoat"". She claimed that she took the brunt of the ""abuse"" and my mom  starved her and said mean things to her. I don't really believe her because my mom was never that bad. She was a believer in corporal punishment but she never took it too far. I think my sister was being dramatic and trying to stir up some shit between me and my mom because she's jealous of my relationship with her. My sister also said that she realized that she resented me because I was my mom's favorite and she wanted to start anew with me and get to know my toddler daughter.

I told her that I wouldn't talk to her unless she had more positive things to say about my mom. I won't sit back and let her slander my mom like that. She destroyed my mom and I want her to  apologize and make things right with my mom first. And I'm looking out for my daughter too. I can't have her auntie waltz in and out of her life as she pleases.

0,"WIBTA if I told my MIL to stop guilting me for moving my husband and myself across country and back off? | Throw away, for obvious reasons. 

Okay, some context here. I just got into my  dream program to pursue a PhD on the west coast. My husband and I are both graduating with undergraduate degrees this May, and we are moving very shortly thereafter. This has always been the plan, and has been expressed very clearly ever since we were first engaged (approx 2 ½-3 years ago). Getting my PhD has always been very important to me, and my husband is incredibly supportive of me doing this. He has always said that he will follow me wherever I go, and genuinely means that. 

Well, we shared the good news with my in laws this week, and it has been near-constant guilt tripping. She keeps going on and on how we’re “abandoning her” and (supposedly joking) that I’m “taking her baby (he’s 24, btw) away”. This also happened when he moved in with me after we got engaged. By the way, both of my husbands siblings live with her, and we live about 20-25 mins away. Whenever we go over (they NEVER come to our place), we just rot in front of the tv and they barely talk to us. It’s super awkward. 

Anyway, her language is essentially implying that I’m taking her favorite child away, and that I’m too young to know what I really want so we should just wait on grad school and have kids first (I’m 22–uhh, not ready for that yet). 

Now, she’s sob-demanding that we spend every Christmas with her (we would have to buy plane tickets and pay for a hotel on grad student stipends) because we abandoned her and I took her “favorite baby” away. 

Personally, I don’t feel that she is entitled to this. She’s known that we would be moving as soon as we completed undergraduate degrees and quite frankly was extremely emotionally and financially neglectful of my husband growing up. I feel that she’s a terrible parent, and has left my husband with many abandonment and trust issues. This new heartstrings-tugging is just another way for her to emotionally manipulate him into being sorry enough for her that he doesn’t cut ties, which he has considered in the past. 

In my view, she’s not entitled to see him at all, and he very generously deals with all of her bullshit at holidays and every four to six weeks. He wants to see her maybe every couple of years for a few days, if that. 

I kind of hate her to begin with for all of the abuse my husband has gone through with her, so I want to get an outside opinion.

1,"AITA for letting my boyfriend sleep over even though it inexplicably bothers my housemate? | My housemate and I have been living together for about a year and a half. She suddenly has decided that she does not like my boyfriend sleeping over as often as he does (which admittedly is quite often). They are (were) friends as well, so he is not a stranger to her. She has told me that it is ""disruptive"" to her life, though she has never explained how, despite me asking each time this has been brought up. 

My boyfriend is never in the common areas of the house. Only in my room, behind a closed door, only at night when we are sleeping. We go out most evenings, and only come back to my place to sleep. She also is rarely home in the evenings (she is a barfly), and also only comes home to sleep. He does not leave anything in the rest of the house. They come face to face maybe once or twice a week for less than a minute in passing (now that my boyfriend knows she doesn't like him there, he avoids her as much as possible despite the fact we used to all be friends).

I could understand how he would be disruptive if he were hanging out on the couch or taking up the bathroom, etc. But he literally only stays in my room to sleep, and maybe take a piss in the morning before leaving. I don't think we are loud as that has never been brought up in the complaint.

When she initially brought it up, I told her that I don't think she has a right to dictate who is in my room or when, if they are not affecting her or getting in her way, and I would give her that same respect of her room as well. 

When asking her HOW his presence behind a closed door of my room bothers her, she says I'm ""arguing semantics"" (?????).  I have offered to compromise if she could explain what the issue is, but again, I haven't gotten a direct answer about that.

Now, my boyfriend and I mostly avoid her, but she has just gone to the landlord and it has created this big drama, and she's telling me she wants me to move out because I am ""not living civilly"" with her by ""brushing [her] off.""

Am I the asshole for thinking and telling her I should be allowed to have whomever I want in my own room whenever I want, especially when she won't explain WHY or HOW it is ""disruptive"" to her?? I don't think that the only way to ""compromise"" is to have to obey her...?",False,False

She doesn’t flirt back but she also doesn’t tell him to stop because “it’s rude to keep rejecting someone over and over”(her words exactly). I personally think it’s disrespectful to her for him to keep flirting with her because she’s told him to stop and she’s in a relationship with me.

1,"AITA if I sell a sword that’s rightfully mine. | My grandfather was from Italy and apparently when he emigrated he brought with him a saber. This saber was a family heirloom. My grandfather had it on his house which, once he passed away, passed to be mine. 

When the succession was made my cousin ( really big history nerd ) asked me if our grandfather’s saber was in the house. He became really annoying about it so I simply said that I didn’t found it in my house and that finally made him stop asking about it.

But recently I found that it was actually in the house ( apparently my grandfather had clean and packed some things before he died, including the sword ). I was curious about it and I found that some people can pay a good amount of money for them, so I thought about selling it, but I still hadn’t really do it.

Flash forward a couple of days and I’m in a meeting with my family, including , my cousin. I don’t remember how but I brought up the fact that I found many things, including the sword, in the house. Immediately after I said that my cousin asked me where it was. And he told me that our grandfather had “promised” him the saber to continue the tradition. My mother and uncle said that it was a great idea for my cousin to get the saber and “keep the tradition alive”. But I was definitely not happy with this. I told him that I was planning on selling it and that I didn’t care about the tradition, the house is mine and so is the saber.

Of course all my family sided with him, they call me selfish and even said that “I was disrespecting my grandfather”. I’m not doing that, he gave me his house and the saber was there, it’s rightfully mine. But that didn’t stopped my family from getting angry and not talking to me.

1,"AITA for not attending a child's event with my ex-wife? | I have a 50-50 custody arrangement of my 8 year old daughter (Lisa) with my ex-wife/her mother (Ariana). For the past few years I have been making it a point to not attend events that Ariana is attending, and she has not been attending events that I attended. If it were up to Ariana, we would be chums - I, however, do not wish to have a friendly relationship with her. A civil relationship for the child's benefit is all that is necessary.

Lisa joined a sports team this year, and the year-end banquet is coming up, at a restauraunt 10 minutes from my home. Ariana informed me that she would like to attend. I requested that since Ariana attended the first game of the year (which was scheduled on 'my' day) that I be able attend the banquet (which also happens to be scheduled on 'my' day) alone this year, and she attend next year's banquet. Ariana replied that she would be there ""no matter who has her that day"". She offered to sit at a separate table and that Lisa would sit with me. 

I explained to her that I did not think it was best for Lisa to have both parents at the event, but only be able to sit with one, and that sitting together was out of the question - I have no interest in conversing with Ariana. I reiterated my request to switch who takes her each year, and that I be able to take her to the first one (since she attended the first game). 

After a few more exchanges with this same story playing out, she informed me she had explained to Lisa (she was home with her at the time) the situation, and had explained my feelings about not wanting to sit at the same table with Ariana, while in the same email explaining my feelings incorrectly.

I told her that I didn't think it was the right thing to do to put Lisa in the middle of this argument, and that it wasn't her place to tell Lisa how I felt about the situation. I informed her that constituted disparaging me to Lisa, and was justiciable - then told her not to do it again. 

I then told her that I had discussed the situation with Lisa (I waited a day so I could discuss it with her in person), and that Lisa did not want to be put in a situation where she had to choose between her parents, and that Ariana will be taking Lisa to the banquet by themselves this year, and that I would like to take Lisa myself next year. I also included that Lisa said this seemed a fair way to do it. I know this seems hypocritical considering I just called Ariana out for it, however... damage control.

Ariana replied that she is not taking Lisa to the banquet just because I decided she would, since it will be 'my' day - that I needed to make it work. She said if she finds out that Lisa doesn't go because I was ""too busy"" that day, it's my fault that Lisa was unable to attend. 

TL/DR - I wanted to take her by myself. She said no, she's coming too. I said, fine, you take her. She said, no, you bring her and if you don't you're the parent at fault.

1,"AITA for reporting a delivery driver who I thought was lying to get out of doing more work? | Throwaway account because I don’t want this linked to my main.

So today for lunch I decided to order from a Mexican restaurant through one of those food delivery services. I’ve had a bad experience or two where my order was missing some items, but the drivers would always be gone before I realized and could catch them to fix the issue. I’d always have to report it through the app’s support chat, which is such a pain to use because they obviously outsource their representatives and it’s frustrating trying to communicate with them. I usually give up after a few messages back and forth.

When my driver arrived, I told her to stay so that I could check the bag and make sure everything was there. I noticed she kind of raised her eyebrow for a moment but otherwise she stood quietly and waited. Sure enough, a couple things were missing. I politely said she needed to return to the restaurant and get my missing items.

In a very neutral, rehearsed-sounding tone, she said that it’s “against company policy to do that and I should contact support through the app.” I explained that I preferred not to deal with support. She said they’re the only ones who can help and she’s *really* not supposed to go back to the restaurant. 

I was a bit annoyed at this point so I asked what the company policy was on making sure orders were correct. She said that restaurants close the bags for the drivers and they’re not meant to open them or the containers inside. Something about food safety violations and not being trained (?). After a moment she apologized for the trouble and left. 

To me this honestly just sounds like a bunch of BS excuses to get out of doing her whole job. If they “can’t go back to the restaurant,” how are customers supposed to get their food/money back? If they “can’t open bags to check the orders” how do they even know they’re delivering the right food? It makes no sense to me.

So on the page where I rate my driver and can leave feedback, I made a note of my situation and explained why I thought she was in the wrong. I then left one star and revoked my tip.
A bit later I was talking to my sister over the phone, who I thought would enjoy the story because she works for a different-but-similar delivery company. My sister said “did you ACTUALLY think she was gonna go back to the restaurant?” I laughed, thinking she was taking a dig at a competing company’s drivers, but she just said “I’m not joking, you literally reported her for following the rules.”

At first I thought my sister had misunderstood a part of the story or something so I kind of brushed it off, but now based on her reaction and what both her and the driver said, I’m wondering if they’re right?

1,"WIBTA for faking a note to my child from their biological Father? | I'm about to become a single mother by choice. My sperm bank provides a lot of information about the donor. A physical description, medical history, professional background, a list of hobbies/interests, a childhood picture of the donor etc. 

Some donors are open to being contacted when the child is an adult. I wanted to find a donor open to this but I was not able to. I chose my donor because he matched all of the other requirements relating to health and was from the same ethnic background as me. That sounds bad, but I feel a strong connection to my home country even though I no longer live there, and it was important to me that my child be the same ethnicity. No other donors matched ethnic background AND my other requirements. Men of my ethnicity don't commonly donate. This wasn't a decision I took lightly. I considered many profiles. I spent weeks deciding. None of the open donors felt right. I don't feel positive about the closed donation. I'd feel unsatisfied never knowing or being able to have a conversation with a biological half of me but I've talked it through with a therapist and come to accept that my family can be enough for my child. 

I'm taking steps to give my child an idea of the biological half they are missing by making an identity box. I included all of the information I have on the donor in the box and my child will grow up understanding their background and the reasons they don't have a father. 

One of the reasons I made my peace with the closed donation is that the bank promised a letter from the donor to the child. I thought at least a letter could give an older child or teenager some closure if they were curious about their biological Father. I received the letter last week. It really isn't a letter. It's clear that the donor was asked to write something while in the office for medicals or something and wrote on a scrap of paper in a hurry. It's a photocopy of the paper and the note is three lines in total. Without quoting verbatim it says:

""This is the strangest thing I've done but it's cool I get to help someone have kids! Good luck in life. I hope it works out for you."" 

It feels anti-climatic to me so I can only imagine how it will feel to my child. I was talking to a friend about it this weekend and I mentioned that I was thinking of typing up something 'from' the donor that was a little more encouraging or at least a little longer. I wouldn't change the essence of the note but I would expand on it so it didn't feel so half-assed. I feel terrible for my child. I know I'll provide all the love and stability in the world but there will come a time when they will wonder. I'm not sure what to do, but my friend advised me that I'm overly emotional at the moment due to hormones and it wouldn't be fair to fake the note even if my child will never find out. I think she's probably right but I'm tempted to give my child more than they've been offered here. WIBTA?",False,False
0,"AITAH for not wanting my in-laws on our cell phone plan? | So I feel a little backstory is necessary here. I (27M) been married to my wife (28F) for 4 years now. I've always had a good relationship with her parents, even if our personalities and views don't always align. My wife and I both work full time and we've always striven to be financially independent.

Recently my MIL got fired from her job, and has picked up 2 lower paying jobs to keep the light on etc. This was just the beginning. Things just got worse and eventually they had to file for bankruptcy. I really felt for them and my wife, but I just couldn't seem to wrap my head around how this happened.

So MIL starts hitting us up to borrow money. I had no problem with this. I came from a poor hard working family of farmers so helping each other out was a part of life. It started out small, $20 for gas here $40 for groceries.  Not soon after though the dollar amount began to increase, 100 bucks until payday for ""insert reason here"". I never felt any resentful for helping, but hearing her telling us she'll pay us back and never did started to get to me.

I knew something was up, I never suspected drugs (No real changes in appearance or attitude for what it's worth) but something had to of changed. I ask my wife if she would be willing to sit down with her mother and try to figure out what the problem is. So she leaves one night to go over and chat, hours pass and when she returns, her mother admitted to having a gambling problem. (Not as casino's, rather ""hot spots"" which are basically just a room with video slots and poker.) This honestly kind of shocked me, I don't want to see her and our family suffer.

Since this opportunity showed itself, my wife and I set up our cell phone plan under my name. Enter the in-laws, my wife told them about us getting on the plan and they immediately want on. I am VERY reluctant to say the least. The plan is in my name and since we haven't seen any of the money we've loaned out back, I feel like this will just increase our payments when they inevitably don't pay for their share. I feel this is my credit score we're talking about so I will have NO choice but to pay it no matter what happens.

I've tried to offer alternatives like setting them up on a pre-paid since I've never really had an issues, even offering to give them some old phones I have (nothing great but solid mid range devices). They don't like this idea and shunned the idea of having to downgrade even a little. This really rubbed me the wrong way so right there I said ""Well I don't feel comfortable at this time but I'm still more than happy to get you set up on prepaid. They were instantly pissed, but i don't care. My credit score is important to me and something I've worked hard on.

Every time she brings her service dog, especially at busy restaurants where the staff don't speak English, it's a big fuss. People don't want a dog in their restaurant, but because of ADA (we're Americans), they have to let her and the dog in.

0,"WIBTA if I banned my father from drinking in my home | So my (24f) dad(53m) is a functioning alcoholic, always had been.
My whole life he finishes out his days with 4 to 8 cans of beer. He is self employed and gets out of bed when he wants, hes always struggling with money but he gets by as my mam (who doesn't drink) works hard to fill in the months and weeks he goes without a payday as his jobs can be quite long. 

So I've always had this annoyance with his drinking because when I lived with my parents and times were tough, I would be sent to live with my grandparents so I could walk to school and they wouldnt have to pay for the petrol or the school bus fare to get me there. However his drinking would persist and even get worse during these hardships. (I hated living with my grandparents) 

I haven't lived at with my parents since I was 18, I now live in a house share with 5 other people in a city 2 hours from home. My dad recently started working on a garden that's 10 minutes from my house and has asked if he could sleepover one night a week to save on petrol as times are tough. I agreed. My roommates said they were fine with it as its normally weekdays and no one uses the sitting room that much. 
He has stayed over three times, the first time he didnt drink at all, the second he had two cans. 

 Last night he showed up unannounced as I had texted the family group chat to let them know I had to leave work early as I was coming down with the flu. I woke up to him in my bedroom asking what I needed from the shops, he then made dinner for me and bought me the pain killers and tissues I needed. 
However he also bought himself a 6 pack and announced that he had bought me a large bottle of whiskey in front of my house mates. He said it was for Christmas and that he wanted me to bring it home when I'm coming. 
This morning I get up at 10am, I'm sick im more than allowed to sleep. And find him still on the couch. 
The 6 cans of beer are empty and he has left one beside the couch. He also drank 3/4 of the large bottle of whiskey that was meant to be for my Christmas. 

I'm infuriated that hes taking advantage of my house this way. He is probably only staying here because he knows he wont be able to drink this much when commuting 4 hours a day.

I got through it but sadly my parents passed away.  NOT A SINGLE one of my ""family"" showed up none of my cousins or aunts or uncles (who all have 10-20 years on me).  I had to hear my parents if anyone other than me and a couple of my friends showed up to visit them.  It broke my heart to say now every time.  When they passes I texted them I was gonna be holding a joint funeral for them both and to please make it.  I sent that to all of them and every last one said they would be there............The time of the funeral and not a single fucking one showed up.  A couple of my friends did tho and I appreciate them at least showing up.  After the funeral I was PISSED.  They couldn't bother showing up to the hospital and they couldn't bother showing up to the fucking funeral.  I called each one and personally told each one of them to never contact me again and to stay out of my life.  A couple tried to protest but I flat out blocked their number.  I know they didn't have other plans that came up cause I told them MONTHS in advance.  

I went to the military at 21 cause I wanted to follow in my great great grandpa's footsteps cause my great grandpa, grandpa, and dad did the exact same thing.

I never went to see them and hoped they would just leave me alone while I hung out with friend's family who was also in camp (I consider that guy a brother to me and his family has opened me into their lives with open arms).

1,"AITA for Criticizing My Parents' Retirement Choices |   

Long time commenter, first time sphincter. So, here goes: (Thanks in advance for your comments and candor.)

My parents are going to retire in the next two years and my Mom used to joke about moving to a retirement community at least six states away -- it would take a 2.5 hour plane flight to go there. Recently, she and my Dad took a trip down there to ""explore the possibilities"". When they got back it turned out that they bought a plot of land at a particular development and were very excited to tell me and my brother.

My brother said one positive sentence about how he is happy that they are happy. I tend to be more critical about everything and so I ask them what made them want to move to the retirement community.

My mother tells me that she really wants to be part of a community, but I counter that in our hometown, which has a very active PTA, Boy/Girl Scout Groups, Parents who Chaperone Field Trips, Religious Center Sisterhoods, etc. she never took the initiative to be part of those groups. She responds that this is because she was the primary breadwinner and worked hard to give us a good life (completely true), but my caveat is that if people really want something, they make it happen.

My father tells me that he really wants to get back in shape, but whenever Mom or I invite him to join us on a 3 mile walk, he backs out because that would wind him. I point out that if he can't do that minimal level of exercise here, why does he think the retirement community would be better. He doesn't have an answer.

Considering that I have found my parents reasons wanting and they have not realized how connected they are to the family and friendship networks that we have in our hometown, I have remained critical of the move. My parents are irked that I continue to not support their decision as they have started to build their house in the retirement community.

When their friends and our family ask me how I feel about this change, I give my honest opinion as I have here in this thread and that bothers them, too. They have told me to keep my opinions to myself and be dishonest about how I feel about their upcoming move when talking outside of our immediate family. They have also insinuated that some of this may come from a fear of them ""abandoning me"", but after serious introspection (because it could be a possibility), I have concluded that this is not the source of the problem, but the specific considerations I outlined (1) that their reasons for moving do not match their historical preferences and (2) that they undervalue the loss of their current family and friendship networks. I repeatedly tell them that the only reason I am critical is because I want them to be happy and I feel that they are making a choice that makes that happiness less likely.

0,"AITA for giving my 15 year old son beer? | My son is at a high school where drinking and drugs are rampant. 

He’s a great kid. He studies hard and he has a job and he always tells me or his mom where he’s going to be when he leaves the house. 

A couple weeks ago he came to me and said he was curious about drinking, that he knows it isn’t good for him and we’d be really disappointed if he went out and drank, but he wants to know what he’s missing. 

I explained about people feeling alcohol relaxes them in social situations, self medicating, how a lot of his friends just drink to look cool to other people and wouldn’t actually be doing it if they didn’t feel they had to, etc. 

But when I started thinking these same thoughts around his age, it was the beginning of my going out and experimenting behind my parents backs. 

So I told him there was nothing mystical or special about alcohol and to prove to him he wasn’t missing some once in a lifetime teenage experience, I’d get us some beers and we could drink them together at home. I just asked he promise me he wouldn’t go out and drink at house parties because he’d be putting himself in unsafe situations and jeopardizing his health. 

He had a can and a half before he was tipsy  (he’s 120-125 pounds soaking wet) and barely even got that far because he hated the taste. 

He said thanks for the experience, it sucked, he wouldn’t be taking up drinking. 

Obviously I said if he had any other questions or if anything ever happened he could always come to me. And that was that. 

My wife is ENRAGED. I didn’t think to run this by her (yes, that part was a mistake) because usually we’re on the same page about child raising decisions and put up a united front. She’s convinced it’s done some sort of irrepressible damage to his brain to get drunk that one time. My argument is better once under our supervision than who knows how often at strangers houses. 

She says showing demystifying alcohol and making it seem like less of a big deal will make him more likely to drink, not less. I disagree.

This is our first teenager and my parents never talked to me about drugs and alcohol growing up so I have no template. AITA?",False,False

We had a fair bit in common and both seemed to enjoy talking to each other and getting to know each other. I quite like this girl and was planning on asking if she wanted to hang out outside of work.

But on leaving work I noticed her file was left out in the open (a manager dropped it) and giving it back I took a photo of her contact number (I don’t have access to the files normally, I also took the photo on a whim I’ve never done anything like that before).

&#x200B;

She spent a weekend in Pennsylvania at a friends house, she had her friend Cheryl drive her there, but then apparently Cheryl got into a car crash (minor injuries, but car broken) at some point in the weekend and my sister was stuck without a ride home. So naturally, she calls me and asks me to pick her up. On that day? No, she wants me to pick her up the next morning, because she wanted to go to some bar with her friends that night. I told her, look, you have time to figure out how to get home. There are buses, trains etc which can bring you home. She scoffed at the idea of that, and started complaining that she hated the idea of taking public transportation all the way back, and that she cant even stand taking the subway 30 minutes to her classes back home. She also said she knew she was going to be hungover, and that she would rather die than be on some bus hungover all the way back. She said she also didn't know how to get to the bus area, and I said she can pretty easily look it up, she is in a city, not some small rural town. The entire conversation was just so frustrating to me. She wanted me to drive over 3+ hours to pick her up, then 3+ hours back, all because she is too lazy to take public transportation? I get it can be difficult to figure your way around in a new city and all that, but guess what? You just got to figure it out somehow. I told her no, she has to figure it out on her own, and that I cant just ruin my entire sunday by driving all the way to PA. She was obviously very upset, and eventually started to curse at me and I just hung up. I'm not gonna lie, I was in a pissy mood before she even called, but either way the entire request seemed silly to me. 

She made it home, but apparently she complained to just about everyone in our family. My mom, dad, brother called or texted saying that I should have picked her up (they all live upstate, so they couldnt have) and that she was basically stranded and she could have gotten killed and all this stuff.

I had him for three weeks in a row, because I was taking him on vacation, and then he just went to his moms for a week and returned to me today. To my surprise, he had an earring in. It was a diamond style earring in his right ear.

His mom didn’t walk him up to the house or anything, she just sent him up to the house and drove off. I called her immediately and told her that I wasn’t OK with it and that she should’ve discussed it with me before doing it. She told me that it’s the same thing as me taking him to get his haircut without her permission which I have done before. I don’t feel like it’s the same thing because a haircut is a normal thing that a kid should get on a regular basis and an earring is not a normal thing for an eight-year-old boy to have and it’s a change to the body. A haircut is not a change to the body.

Him and his mom were telling me that he asked for it and that it was his idea, but I’m not sure about that. He’s never expressed any kind of interesting that before. I feel like she was the one pushing it.

I told my son that he’s not going to keep it in. I removed it immediately. I don’t want him to go to school with it in. I told my son that it was wrong of his mom to do that without consulting me first. He seemed upset but not too terribly upset.

They set a time to meet and eat cake that was 2 hours before the showtime since they are the anal-type that always factor in obnoxiously large time margins for anything.

My roommates and I really wanted boba, so we made a quick chinatown run before heading over to meet the rest of them. It took a bit longer than we expected and we ended up being late for the cake (\~45 minutes), but they had already started serving cake anyways and it isn't like it made us late to the movies. We didn't end up eating much of our cake because we still had our boba with us.

The people who made the cake were acting all offended and made a bigger stink about being late to the movie than was necessary. We still made it to the theater with plenty of time, so I think they were just trying to guilt us about not eating their cake.

She works with 6 other highschoolers and 5 college kids. The high schoolers she works with don't like their manager, he keeps their hours just below the threshold for higher pay, doesn't give promised raises, and is just an asshole to work with.

Recently my daughter and one of her friends were joking about making a union like the ones they were studying at school. They texted some of the other kids from work, and the idea started gaining traction. So I talked with them about it, explaining the possible benefits and risks. I tried to encourage them to do their own research too. I thought it was pretty cool that they were considering taking something they're learning about in history class and applying it.

The girls ended up inviting the other high school kids who worked at the coffee shop to our house, to talk about how to unionize. I could tell some kids were going along for fun. But most of them were taking it seriously. I helped them write out their demands and practice them. They even got the college kids, who were unhappy with scheduling around exams, on board. 

They all went to the coffeeshop Sunday morning, and presented their case to the boss. Who absolutely blew up on them, and told them that if they didn't stick to their schedule, they were all fired. But the kids stood their ground. He started singing out the kids that were scheduled to work that morning and telling them to start work immediately or they're fired. And so three of them got fired. Then he told the rest that anyone else who didn't report for their shifts would be fired too, and I don't think he expected them to call his bluff. He fired several more, then started demanding that the ""fired"" kids come in to work. Right now, the kids are all holding strong. Apparently the manager is trying to replace everyone fast, but isn't having much luck. 

I'm honestly quite proud of my daughter for all this. But the parents of the other high school kids aren't all OK with this. Several of them have called me up or come to speak to me furious with me for these reasons:
- Making their kid lose their job, which they were supposed to keep to teach them hard work and responsibility
- Encouraging kids to be entitled brats and sabatoge a local business owner
- Letting the kids play at something they didn't really understand

I told them that the kids made their choice, all I did was give them a place to talk and plan things. I got a call from the coffeeshop owner too, to say that my daughter hasn't been covering her shifts. And that the kids are ""playing"" at a union. I told him that it doesn't sound like play to me, perhaps he should listen to what they have to say. And he got furious with me, calling my daughter lazy.

There are always people who stay in the left lane for as long as possible, skipping the giant line of traffic in the right lane. By the time they get to the area where the left lane is closed off, the drivers will force their way into the front of the line by cutting the other drivers off. 

It annoys me seeing this happen because we ALL have places to be, people to meet up with, running late for work, etc. so being cut off by the jerks who wanted to skip the line just makes me mad. Maybe it’s just the kindergartener inside me but I really hate when people skip the line and cut.

At my Uni, you can book study rooms at the library which are private spaces for group work. They’re super nice. 
However, many people reserve them and then just never show up. Which is annoying because then there is just empty study spaces that other people “can’t use”. 

But, the rule is that if you don’t show up within 15minutes of your reservation, you forfeit it. 

So, my group of friends and I needed a room to study where we could talk and needed a white board to do problems. 
Of course many of the rooms were already reserved for the times we could meet up. 

So I go to the library and notice an empty study room, but it had been reserved from 6pm-11pm. 
It was already 6:30 so i decided to take the room. 
My friends and I get to studying and around 9:30, some dude comes into the room, and says “can you guys leave, I reserved this room”. 

So, I said, “actually, since you weren’t here by 6:15, the reservation no longer stands. Sorry, but we are using this room now. We will be done in about 45mins though.” 
The guy got visibly upset and argued saying his name is on the reservation list, so we have to leave. I told him to go and get one of the Office Assistants if he wanted to and that I refused to leave. He mumbled something that sounded like  “bitch” and slammed the door and walked away. 


One of the people I was studying with basically called me an asshole and said we should had just given up the room. I think the situation just made her uncomfortable. She’s not confrontational.

One of my friends' girlfriends, I'll call her Jackie, had a pimple on her cheek that was a bit noticeable since she was not wearing any makeup. No big deal, everyone gets pimples, she was confident enough to run a 5k marathon without it being an issue and of course no one mentioned anything, it's one of those things that you see and just kinda look past.

So I uploaded our picture on Facebook without retouching anything because I'm just a guy who wants to post a picture of a bunch of people I ran with, for posterity more than for likes. An hour later I get a scathing text from Jackie telling me to delete the picture. She said I should have asked her before I posted it and I should have photoshopped her pimple before posting it.  I said sorry but at the same time how was I supposed to know that it would be an issue to her?

I admit her text pissed me off so I deleted the picture and cropped it to remove her (luckily she was the last person on the left). I'm thinking of uploading that cropped picture but I haven't done it yet, since I'm already asking if AITA for not photoshopping her pimple in the first place I guess I'll also ask if WIBTA if I upload that cropped picture.",False,False
0,"AITA for wanting to run away from my parents because my father told me to kill myself out of rage and my mom said I should feel guilty for pushing him to say those words? | For context. I’m 17, I live in Australia, recently graduated high school and got an offer from the University of Adelaide. I wanted to defer, but my father vehemently denied me that right. 

For even more context that led up to what my father said. Over the past three and a half years, I got put into a boarding school I didn’t really like, but put up with regardless. I’ve never really had a healthy relationship with my father, as I’m always terrified of his volatile temper, and he was almost never willing to spend time with me as a child. However, he did work to provide me and my family with a comfortable life. At that boarding school, I was overwhelmed with the workload I had to face since I never had to study to get top grades (I only went to international schools before), and asking teachers and friends for help has always been extremely uncomfortable for me. This in turn led to my studies not being great, and me getting a very average ATAR of 61.70. However, I was still able to get into the course I wanted.


Now, I haven’t been the best child, but I was never the worst. I had never gotten detention, had never handed in a late assignment, and had never gotten into trouble with teachers. The worst thing I had done at school was not ask teachers for help and not put in as much effort as I should have. The worst thing I did to my parents was steal some money from their credit card, which is awful as is - however, I don’t think it warranted my father telling me to kill myself. He constantly tells me that I wasted three and a half years of my life, that he wasted money on getting me tuition, and that I put him and my mother under stress that no other parent has to face. He also claims I’m the reason they’re so close to divorce. He also sometimes calls me an useless moron and that I’m the most lazy and awful person he’s ever known. A few days ago, I fucked up researching housing costs for my university, and he lost it. He proceeded to yell all of the above at me, and then said, without paraphrasing, “A few months ago you told the bloody counsellors that you wanted to kill yourself? Well maybe you should have killed yourself then, it would have been easier on all of us.” I started crying really badly and he yelled at me asking why the fuck I was crying and I said through tears that he told me to
Kill myself, and he said “You’re goddamn right, you don’t deserve to live anymore, go hang yourself tomorrow.” The next day my mom told me I should feel guilty because I hurt my dad so much and that I should feel bad for making him say those things, and that I should look past it. Again, the extent to which I “hurt” my parents was listed above. A few days later I got my acceptance letter, and two days later I told my parents I wanted to defer. My dad lost it again, asking me who the fuck I am to have the arrogance to defer, and that I should be taking this god-given gift and studying hard, rather than fucking deferring, and that I should go fuck myself.


Sorry if this is a rambling mess, I’m on mobile and don’t really know how to format. I believe I’ve covered everything on both sides, so please let me know if clarification is needed. I really want to run away from my parents and start over, but because I’m 17 my father is still controlling me and forcing me to start university immediately. I feel bad because I have done some things that are wrong, but I don’t feel they’ve warranted what’s been said to me. In short - am I the asshole here?

1,"AITA for not jumping up and helping my parents bring in the groceries? I'm an adult and I pay rent if that helps. | I'm 33 years old and I've pretty much always lived with my parents. To me there's no shame in it because it's super cheap (they charge me $200, which honestly would be market rate where we live) and it has everything I want and need without the hassle of having to look for a new place to live. 

We get along most of the time but honestly I just avoid them. Recently the toilet flooded in my bathroom which means they are having to remodel my section of the house so we ""run into"" each other a lot more than when I used to lock myself in my room most of the time. 

Well today my parents went to Costco. When they got home I was sitting on the couch playing Apex and my mom asked me to get up and help them bring in groceries. I told her in a minute. I was honestly too into my game to notice that they made several trips back and forth and finally my dad told me to get my ass up. I told him I would in a minute. He said a minute is now and grabbed the controller out of my hand. It turned into a huge shouting match and now they are checking into a hotel and expecting me to have a place to live by Friday (which is basically impossible). Of course they brought up my younger brother who is married with two kids and was just promoted at his job. They have their golden child of course but to throw his shit in my face is bullshit. 

I  mean I guess I could have gotten up and helped them but to me because I pay rent that gives me the privilege to pretty much say no when they ask me for stuff like helping with groceries or yard work.

0,"AITA for telling my friends ex girlfriend to leave me the fuck alone? | My friend just broke up with his girlfriend of about a year. They’re both taking it pretty hard, but she’s taking it the hardest. She’s freaking the fuck out, calling and texting him, leaving him letters, texting his friends and family. She’s going crazy. 

So she eventually reached out to me. Texting me several times a day. I just didn’t respond. I feel if my friend wanted to talk to her or let her know how he is, he’d let her know. But she keeps texting me. Last night was the last straw for me. She sent me several texts at like 2am and they woke me up. 

I was pretty pissed. I sent back “(friends name) obviously does not want to talk to you, take a hint. Leave me the fuck alone!” I then turned off my phone. This morning I turned on my phone and her and a mutual friend of ours were calling me an asshole for taking to her that way.

1,"AITA for not getting over into the right-hand lane on the highway? | Hello good people, this question has bugged me for quite some time and a recent incident convinced me to come to this sub to get an answer. 

I live in the US and drive on the highway for 2-3 hours on trips quite often. I don't drive too high above the speed limit, I use my signal to change lanes, and I'm a defensive driver, so all in all I consider myself a relatively safe driver. If I'm on long stretches of highway, I typically get in the left most lane and set my cruise control to 10 miles above the speed limit (or what traffic is currently going) so I don't have to worry about switching lanes and keeping my foot on the pedal constantly for long periods of time as I get foot cramps really easily that are painful and annoying on long car rides. However, I realize that some people want to go faster than 10 miles over the speed limit, but I always figured going 80 mph in a 70 mph is a reasonable speed and there's usually an oppurtuntity for people to pass me in another lane. 

However, I was driving the other night on a trip and I did my usual thing. Things were fine for a while, but then a large truck came up right behind me and began tailing me. There were plenty of opportunities for the truck to get into another lane and get ahead of me, but it continued to tail me, getting dangerously close to me. Finally, the truck switched lanes, sped up, and then jumped back into my lane. They then proceeded to brake check me, forcing me to slow down. To prevent them from doing anything further, I changed lanes and slowed down to around 65 mph in a 70 mph zone on the highway.

1,"AITA for asking my ex boyfriend to change his profile picture? | My ex-boyfriend of two years and I broke up almost three months ago. Part of the reason we broke up was bc I suspected he was cheating on me. Lo and behold he started dating that person not even a week after we broke up. 

Recently I asked him to change his profile picture bc it’s an old picture I took of him with my dog. He refused stating that he liked it and it was an iconic picture. I said I didn’t give a fuck bc it was a picture with my dog. 

For more context he also hasn’t deleted pictures of me ( he’s not even in the pictures, they’re just pictures of me). 

He reached out to one of my friends and asked her what my problem was and that I’m acting childish.

1,"AITA for not throwing my career away for my mentor? | (sorry if this is long)

Background: 18 months ago I started working as an intern at a company. During that time, my supervisor was a complete no-show. He cancelled meetings with me, delegated review of my work, and eventually moved to a different department without bothering to write an intern review. 

That's where my mentor, let's call her J, came in. J was a teammate of my supervisor and voluntarily setup time to review my work, give me feedback, and even submitted a final review to management. I guess it was a good review because I got hired full time a year ago to work on the same team with J.

Starting a few months back, our supervisor has been coming to work less and less. (Sounds familiar, right?) As a result, the even-higher-ups started requesting that J take over leading the team while they ""handle the situation."" Six weeks later, our team's productivity has gone up, our whole team is happy, higher-ups are happy, and they announce that they're looking to hire someone new to run the team. 

I've only heard secondhand what happened next, but basically J asked if she could have the title and salary of the position since she had been doing it now for months. Higher-ups told her they would be hiring a new guy starting in March instead, but they still wanted her to stay on and run things for another  6-12 months while he got up to speed. J gave them her two week's notice on the spot, and higher ups were *livid*. Publicly livid, going so far as to call her an ""emotional woman"" and vowing to call up her new company to make sure they ""know about her insubordinate attitude""

**Here's where being a potential asshole comes in.** In our department, it's tradition to buy someone a goodbye card before they leave the company. The card is left on a table in public view for people to sign over a week or so. Nobody signed J's card. J was pretty unhappy and even *asked* me if I would go sign her card.  The thing is, she already knows how positively I feel about her mentorship and didn't see why I needed to put my name down on a goodbye card for my superiors to see. Also it seems kind of weird to me that someone would ask someone else to sign their goodbye card....But anyway, on J's last day, a higher-up personally delivered the empty card to J in front of everyone, wished her good luck, and walked off.  said her goodbyes, and I haven't been able to get in touch with her since.

1,"AITA for not donating furniture/appliances that were in good condition? | ~Mobile post disclaimer goes here~

I just closed on a house and decided to get all new furniture, appliances and electronics. I tried selling my old furniture and appliances on Craigslist and Facebook but had a lot of people flake out, so I paid to have everything--beds, sofas, dining table, chairs, desks, washer and dryer, etc--hauled to the dump. When my family and friends found out, they told me that was really wasteful and inconsiderate of me to throw away perfectly good furniture and appliances. They said I should have donated to the Salvation Army or another charitable organization, since my things were less than 3 years old and in very good condition (I live alone, no kids or pets). It honestly never crossed my mind to do that, and even my boyfriend is saying how thoughtless I am for dumping everything instead of donating to people who could really use it.

1,"AITA for getting upset with my boyfriend for monopolizing the night | My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months. He’s much more outgoing and charismatic than me, he’s the guy that walks into a party knowing no one and walks out with the richest guy there inviting him to a beach or something. He works in sales so I guess it makes sense.

For me it takes much more time to get to know people and I only have a few close friends.

I was having him meet my friends for the first time last night. We went out for drinks. My friends all introduced themselves they started talking. They did the usual introductory “where do you work” etc. he started telling a story about work and all three of my friends were charmed by him. The rest of the night my friends only would talk to him and didn’t pay any attention to me. 

He brought me up in a few parts of the conversation but my friends quickly shifted the topic back to him.

After we got home I was upset and asked him when he is with me to try and be less outgoing so I get a chance to talk. He said that he thought the goal of meeting my friends was to make them like me and that he tried to include me but they shut him down.

He’s saying that he’s not going to change who he is when around me, but I think he should just be more sensitive to my needs.

1,"AITA for telling my boyfriend I can no longer support his work after his staff were rude to me? | My boyfriend, 29, is a director at a youth theatre. He directs their shows and I’ve been to see a lot of them. I used to work as a receptionist/admin assistant at a performing arts school, which is how we met as his company rented rooms at ours and he chatted and one thing lead to another 

However a year ago, I got diagnosed with severe depression. I’d had it a while, but it got so bad I ended up with suicidal thoughts and had to leave my job. My boyfriend has stuck by me through all of this even though it hasn’t been easy 

So for a year I’ve been out of work. I’m at a point now where I’m better and have been trying for a lot of jobs. But none have been successful.


My boyfriend tells me his company are looking for a admin assistant and I’d be working for his boss, who I’ve met, who’s the company director.

He’s told him before about me and my struggle so knows how desperate I am so my boyfriend and I think great! Let’s put my name forward. 

He asks me for an interview. It goes great and it’s clear I can do it. However in the interview he says something which hurts me. “I know it’s been hard for you, and being second best to your boyfriend all the time can’t be easy, in terms of career success...” I leave feeling hurt but brush it off as I really want the job.

He asks me to come for a “second interview” even though he knows me well, but I do it. My boyfriend tells me there’s no way I can’t get this job as he knows what I did before. And has recommended me. 

After that, I get an email telling me I was unsuccessful. My boyfriend is confused so I write an email asking for feedback. I get a call instead, he says “Don’t take it out on us please.” I explain I’m not and my email had been professional. He says “Look, we don’t want you and that’s that. Don’t act like a spoiled child. We saw more talented candidates and even though I know you personally I can’t take someone on out of pity because they’re not doing so great”

Now this would’ve been an okay answer if I was still struggling with depression but I’m not and told him in the interview I’m ready to go back to work. The role was exactly the same as the job I had. Same admin work, literally the lowest paid job, sorting papers, taking cash from kids. Phoning the parents. I’d just be with him in an office doing that. It’s hardly “talent” so he doesn’t make sense.

I found him very arrogant.The way he spoke to me proves he thinks less of me. My boyfriend agrees he was rude however refuses to say anything as his job is important Since this guy will be in the audience in my boyfriends shows I told him I don’t want to come see them or support his work at all.

We argued and he’s mad at me because it’s nothing to do with him. But I don’t want to be involved in his work anymore. I’ve been judged and made to feel like someone who isn’t worthy of being a part of the team. Also I’m finding it hard to discuss his work whenever he talks about it

Am I overreacting or should I tell him I’m standing by this?

0,"AITA for leaving a note on our neighbors’ door? | Howdy, y’all. 

So about a year ago, these 3 gals moved into an apartment in our building. We actually moved from that unit, to another in the same building. The ended up pushing their move-in date a week earlier, and bringing their parents to make demands on their behalf, but were generally polite despite requiring we suddenly clean up a week early for them. 

Since then, they’ve taken to ignoring us on the street. We’ve all just tried to be neighborly, but have since given up wasting time on it. The building is in a more expensive part of town, quite “unique,” and the rent is incredibly low. So “it is what it is” has become the motto for this dilapidated gem. Now, about the note...

It’s their first apartment. They’ve had issues with taking out trash for nearly their entire time here. While there are cans on the roof, most of us just go ahead and take our trash down to the dumpster. The place is owned by an older couple, and having the husband drag our trash all the way downstairs is something we and other tenants would prefer to avoid. Besides, there’s much more important work to be done around the place. 

But these gals can’t even be bothered to bring their trash outside. They just let it pile up outside their door, inside the building, and stink begins to fester. So the owner eventually hauls it all the way outside and downstairs himself. I found him doing this one day, fumed over it for the night, and we wrote a note the next morning. It read;

>	“Look-
    Leaving your garbage up here is *trashy*. Leaving it up here to rot & stink up the building is disgusting. But- making it such a problem that other people have to take care of it is **fucking shameful**. Get your shit together, ladies. 
Sincerely,
  Who cares, take care of **your** shit.”

1,"AITA because I turned down a dinner offer at my son’s apartment because their place is too hot? | I’m making a throwaway to keep things private.

My son and his wife moved into their new apartment last year and have tried inviting us for dinner a few times since then to have us come and see their new place. Every time unfortunately I’ve had work or some other commitment come up due to which I haven’t been able to make it. They seem to mind it a lot because apparently I’ve visited my daughter and her husband’s place a few times even though they live twice as far away, though I’ve explained to them clearly I have never turned down their offers willingly and it’s always been an unfortunate incident getting in the way, while my daughter’s invites have worked out because nothing ever got in the way.

So coming to the point, I invited them last week over at our place for dinner. They quickly jumped on us and said if we’re inviting them for dinner, that means we’re free, so we should go over for dinner at their place instead. I turned it down because it’s too hot and I didn’t want to be inside an apartment on a hot day. They’ve been completely ignoring my texts since then and didn’t show up at the dinner I invited them to. Later I heard from other family members that they’re really hurt and they’ve decided they’ll never invite me ever again. I don’t know why this blew up so much. I just didn’t want to be at their place on a hot day is all, but I did want to see them and hang out with them. I think they’re over reacting to the situation, but obviously the rest of the family thinks I’m at fault.

But Please hear me out before you guys pass any judgements.

So last week, Me (M39) and my wife ( F36) and our two kids ( B5 & G7) decided to go visit my in-laws, And I found out that my sister in law and her three annoying kids 5,9,11 are also there.
No big deal, right??? Wait til you hear this

So, when my wife and her mom were in the kitchen I was TOLD by my 
Sister in law to watch HER kids, my daughter was sleeping on the couch and my son was feeding the dog.

While HER kids were running around : LITERALLY screaming, yelling, throwing things and fighting with each other, I was having a horrible headache.
They spent nearly fourty minutes making a mess all over the place.

Then the annoying little one 5, wanted to annoy my daughter so she tried to pull her
hair while sleeping,
I told her "" Don't"" but she did it again, then again then again.
I completely lost it and snatched her toy she yelled in my face "" Hey, it's miiiiiiine!!!""
I told her "" Shut up!
Go sit tight over there for ten minutes and think about what you just did, a'right""
Thanks to her, my daughter woke up looking very confused.

This annoying little devil started crying calling her mom, her mom comes running outta the kitchen and asked what happened
I explained to her what her daughter was doing, and told her that her kids need to be a little more disciplined and that it wasn't okay to run around and throw stuff at my kids
she then got upset and she looked at me
And was like "" It's my mom's house, don't tell me what's okay and what isn't""...blah blah blah.
Dear wife stood there watching.
SIL tried to play the victim infront of MIL which is the reason why those kids are behaving like this
She said it wasn't a big deal, (it wasn't???)
And instead of apologizing to me and my daughter, SIL awarded her kid with TWIX, and took her to play in the other room, I was really pissed off and really wanted to take the kids and leave, But when I turned to my daughter she told me she wanted a TWIX too.

The kids fight over the costumes they're difficult when it comes to bathroom time, and the kids that come in costume are always wary of getting messy (not wanting to participate in art/sensory experiences). It's been a problem with a little over half of my class, but ESPECIALLY with one girl \[5f\] (I'll call her Sally).

I've had multiple, specific talks with her parents before about not sending her in costume, but they seem to forget after a few days.

Today, Sally came fully in costume from tiara down to heels. I gently reminded her mom when she dropped her off that, although she looked cute, costumes were not allowed in class unless it was a spirit day and I would have to have her change into her extra clothes to continue the day. She just rolled her eyes and left.

I talked to my school director and she said just to remind parents of my classroom policy, so I sent out an email to all my parents that said:

""Good afternoon, parents! Just a reminder: costumes are not allowed in class! Aside from being a distraction to the learning process, they pose a potential safety risk to your children. Please remember that your children's day to day activities consist of moving around and (occasionally) getting messy, so keep that in mind when dressing your child! Any concerns may be addressed to myself or \[school director\]. Thank you!""

This afternoon, Sally's mom came to pick her up and screamed at me for singling her child out in my email and trying to police what her daughter wore. She said I was ruining her self confidence and that she seriously questioned my understanding of children by forbidding her daughter's ""self-expression"". She also was very upset that I didn't talk to her personally about Sally's outfit, but, like I said, I tried to this morning and I also have had this conversation with her at least 4 times since December (plus she's not the only parent I've had to tell).

I understand that sometimes kids fight to wear a certain thing in the morning and parents just give in because it's not worth it the argument, but I feel like I have to draw the line somewhere.

So, Reddit: AITA for sending a whole class message after one student's outfit violated my class rules?

tldr; One of my Pre-K students violated my ""no costumes"" classroom rule and I sent a whole-class email out about it to remind all parents about the rule (almost all of my students have broken this rule since December)",False,False
1,"AITA. Gave my cousin a gift, his parents tried to take it away as punishment for something I think is unfair and I told them to give it back to me? | I’m 21F, and my 2 cousins are 15M(Tj) and 13M(Ked).

When the newest iPhones launched, I gifted Tj and Ked 1 each.

Turns out Ked has been stealing money from some extended family members, Ked himself admitted to this. A fight broke out and Keds parents defended him, didn’t care he was stealing money and cut the extended family members off.

Over winter break, Ked apologized to extended family and made amends, but his parents are stubborn and narcissistic and will never admit they’re wrong and just basically hates extended family now. 

The extended family members hosted a house warming party and wanted all the cousins to spend the night. Both Tj and Ked wanted to come but their parents told Ked they didn’t want him to go Incase extended family tried accusing him of stealing again, and told Tj he could do whatever he wanted and they trusted him to make the right decision. Ked stayed home and Tj came to the sleep over/housewarming. 

Cue his phone blowing up with his parents yelling at him for coming to extended families house. How he’s a disappointment. They trusted him to make the right decision and he failed. How if they hate someone he needs to follow along and hate them too. I saw all these texts and can confirm 100% they said this. Tj asked to be left out of the drama and they repeated that if they hated someone, he had to hate them too. 

When he came back home they grounded him and told him they were taking his phone away for 2 weeks. Also, when Ked admitted to stealing, he NEVER got punished.

I’m sorry but I just don’t agree, I’m completely disgusted by the way they raise their kids and have just lost all respect for the parents. I told them while I can’t control how they discipline their children, it’s not their property to take away from him, and I won’t go behind their back and let him use the phone but since it was my gift to him, I’d like to hold on to it until the 2 weeks are up. 

Welp, of course the narcissistic parents made a big deal and other extended family members are telling me I should’ve just stayed out of it and let them raise their kids how they want and I’m only asking for the phone to be in my possession because I think they’re treating him unfairly. We all can agree they’re horrible parents. If they were decent parents and was punishing him for something fair, I WOULDNT have asked for the phone back. 

Heres where I may be the asshole. I asked for the phone back because I felt like they were trying to establish dominance over Tj and trying to control him with cruel punishment and unfair rules, so I decided to take some of their “power” away by asking for my gift back.",False,False
1,"WIBTA for reporting coworker who's sneaking her daughter into work? | I work at a group home for a sweet elderly woman. There are 4 other female staff and me. Last week i came in on my off day to pick up my glasses case that i left at the home. When i came i noticed that the other staff on shift looked a bit surprised to see me. I tried to go to the office room to get my case when one of my coworkers stopped me and said that she could get it for me. I told her it was fine and went to the room myself. When i walked in a saw a young girl sitting on the computer chair using her phone. I was confused but got my case and left the room. I asked my coworkers why there was a random little girl in our office room. They all looked at each other for a while and finally my coworker (we'll call her Amy) told me that its her daughter and she's just waiting for her sister to come pick her up. I was confused but had somewhere to be so i left.

The next day I called one of my other coworkers (we'll call her Mary) and asked her what was going on. She admitted to me that Amy doesn't have a babysitter right now and has been letting her daughter sit in our office room for the past two weeks till her sister is able to pick her up. I was shocked and angry. Why would someone bring their daughter not only to work but to another persons home? Mary told me that she's only there for two hours and not to be so hard on her. I still felt like it was wrong so i talked to the elderly woman i work for and told her how sorry i am that Amy is taking advantage of her and her home. The elderly woman told me that it was fine and she didn't mind since Amy is going through a hard time. I know she's just saying that because she doesn't want to be mean.

I've been thinking about this non stop these past couple of days and don't think she should be allowed to do this. I texted my other coworkers, except Amy, and told them we should report Amy. Some of my coworkers said that i was being cold hearted and the others told me they understand how i feel but that i should just ignore it.  Even my husband is telling me to just ignore this but i can't. WIBTA for reporting this?",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my partner that the mother of his kids can’t come to parent teacher interviews? | There’s no nice way to word that and the title is misleading, but there’s a story behind this. 

So my step kids are 6 and 8. They’ve been in school for 3 + 2 years respectively. My husband and her used to do parent teacher interviews together, however in every single one she’d speak over him when he had questions about the kids learning, how to help them at home, etc, and tell him he’s “dumb” (he’s dyslexic but he doesn’t want his kids to go the same way) and it got to the point where he was ashamed to go in and ask questions. I ended up scheduling my husband and I our own interview times away from his ex, which the school also agreed with and encouraged as they too felt each parent could speak more freely without the other there.

Now to today. The kids have interviews this week. I booked them 4 weeks ago when the slots opened up. It’s been in every newsletter for the last month. Today his ex tells us she hasn’t booked interviews and is demanding to come to ours. We’ve said no and she’s pushing it, saying that I (as their step mother) have less of a right to be there than she does. Which I’m not arguing with, I know she’s their mother and I’m not. But there are still slots open, albeit not within an hour of each other, but again, she’s known for a month and didn’t book and is still refusing to book. Husband considered for a brief moment letting her join us but I stopped him and reminded him why we have our own separate interviews from her.

0,"AITA for not wanting to do a Q&A with my wife | So I’m going to keep parts of this vague for anonymity. My wife is a smaller celebrity, she’s not an incredibly popular celebrity like say Rihanna but she has a good following.

When we were dating and before we got married, one of the conditions we agreed to is that I would be kept out of it as much as possible. She can do as many interviews and whatever as she wants, but I don’t want anything to do with it. I did make the concession that I would go to any events with her to support her. I frankly never really wanted to marry a celebrity, nor be one, and never saw the appeal. I married my wife because she’s a terrific person and (usually) makes me very happy, not because she’s a celebrity. If I had to choose my least favorite thing about her it would be that.

She knows all this. However her agent apparently told her that us doing a Q&A about how staying home is like and what’s keeping us occupied would be good press somehow, and that it would be an easy way to “humanize” her. I don’t think she needs humanizing but I’m also not her agent so that’s whatever.

She’s been begging me over the last few days to do it with her and saying it would just be a one time thing, and it would really help her. I told her she can talk about me but I don’t want to do it with her. Today we had a big fight about it because she was bothering me about it while I was trying to work. She said that I “can’t even do this one thing” for her and that I should be trying to support her and she would do the same for me in my job. There’s no real equivalent for my job because no one is doing public software engineering Q&As with their spouses. I reminded her of our agreement and she got mad and said I always throw the “stupid” agreement in her face.

I was talking to a friend on the phone, and he said I should just do it for her and it’s a dick move to marry a celebrity and then refuse to ever do anything publicly with her. But on the other hand this same friend tried to make it big as a rapper so I’m not entirely sure he even understands my point of view.

1,"WIBTA for telling my kid we have to sell his toy? | My son turned three years old today. We had a little celebration for him yesterday and he got a few presents. As is often the case with kids, his favorite thing was the small, $7 Paw Patrol toy we got to put on his cake. Figures.

Today after I went to work, my wife was working out in the yard on our small garden, repotting a few things, and had him out playing and helping a bit. She had to step inside the door to grab something (a round trip of less than 10 seconds) and asked him specifically not to touch the plants she was working on while she stepped inside. As soon as she turned her back, he picked up and threw several of the plants she was moving, basically killing them. My wife, who has been working hard on this garden for weeks now, was very upset. He smirked and tried to cutely say he was sorry, but laughed as she got after him and put him in time out. She texted me to express frustration and asked what we should do about his destructive behavior.

I said she should take away his new toy and tell him that daddy said we need to sell it so we can buy new plants for the garden, and to tell him that we can only have nice things when we take good care of them (this would not be the first time we've had a talk like this).

If he were a bit bigger I think I would feel just fine doing this, but the fact that he is still just barely 3 years old and is generally a very nice kid is giving me some pause. WIBTA for taking his toy forever?",False,False

My friends tend to have a laid back approach when it comes to flopping in someone’s house for the night (you land where you land), but I’m just not like that anymore, and historically I’ve landed in some pretty shit places.

I wanted everyone important to him on the picture board so I contacted all my cousins, aunts, uncles, and anyone close to him to ask if they could text me any pictures they wanted included. I told them I could come pick up hard copies if they needed and would pay for all the printing. Two out of his six grandchildren had almost no pictures of them with him. They each sent me 2 pictures. My neighbor sent me more pictures than they had with their own grandfather. I put the picture boards together and sent them up at the funeral. My cousin who only had 2 pictures with him told me I ruined her day to remember him and that I was a self centered bitch.

1,"AITA if I cancel my father's dream trip bc I'm afraid to leave my cat? | My father has always wanted to do a cruise.  We've always had to vacation local because my mom was ill, but she passed away last year.  My dad himself is elderly and on the spur of the moment I agreed to go on a cruise with him in a few months.  He's mega excited.  The tickets are already purchased.  

The more I think about it, the more nervous I am about this.  I have a cat who is a senior and has cancer.  He's getting chemo and right now is doing okay, but a cruise means leaving him for a week without a way to quickly come back if anything happens.  The tickets are transferrable and I'm considering trying to find someone else to go with him.  I'll even give them the ticket for free. I know my dad will be upset and might even refuse to go. He can be very stubborn and sometimes pouts like that.  But my cat is a huge priority for me.  I'll have people check on him multiple times a day, but he's used to 24/7 care.  If lord forbid he were to die while I was away I would absolutely never get over it. 

I can't talk openly to dad about this, because he'll tell me to cancel everything and then probably won't talk to me for a few months.  I'd have to find someone else to take the ticket and tell him closer to the departure date.  I know my cat probably would be okay for just one week...but considering his health issues it does feel like a risk that I'm not sure I'm comfortable taking.

1,"AITA For getting snippy with the building management office woman? | I take a med that I receive via mail. A week ago, I noticed I was low on this medication and ordered another shipment. I normally pickup the package in the building management office, which I have not had trouble with in the past. Yesterday, it was announced that my college would be unexpectedly closing down for reasons that aren't allowed to be mentioned on this sub. I made arrangements to return to my hometown tomorrow afternoon. The building management office is not open on Saturdays.

After taking todays dose, the final dose I had left, I went up to the building management office to check if they had received my package. As I arrived, I discovered that the office door was locked and there was a sign hanging on the door stating that the office was closing down in-person meetings to stop the spread of disease. Through the door window, I was able to see a management office employee sitting on a couch watching Netflix. I knocked on the window and she told me that the office was closed and that I should call the office if I needed any information.

Another management employee showed up to enter the office. I attempted to talk to her and she told me, in person, that the office was closed and they were unable to tell me anything in person. This continued for a few minutes, with me asking questions and her telling me that the office was closed and that I'd need to call for any information. I grew increasingly frustrated, both by what I felt was a needlessly obtuse conversation and the fact that, if I didn't get my package this afternoon, I would be without medication for several days while I waited for another package to arrive in my home town. I did not mention what was contained within the package, only that it was important I received it today.

I lost my temper and yelled at the management woman, telling her that I didn't want to make a phone call, I wanted my fucking package. I stormed off after giving her the middle finger. In hindsight, I could have handled the situation with more civility, but I do feel that some anger was warranted due to the management woman's absolute refusal to say anything other than that I should call the office for information. Telling me to my face that she couldn't tell me things to my face felt dumb.

I called the office, talked to Netflix girl, and was walked through the process of signing up to have them leave my package outside my door. I have my meds now, everything will be fine. An hour after the incident, I received a call from the woman I cursed out's supervisor asking about the situation. I explained the situation to him and told him that I had been rude, something I am sorry for. He also pointed out that the management woman was just following building policy.

My sister says that school is not for her, and that she doesn’t see a point in finishing high school. 

My dad said he doesn’t care, that my sister can do whatever she wants, as she is old enough to make that decision. Legally, yeah, she’s allowed to drop out, but I think she’s being incredibly stupid.

She said that since our dad doesn’t have a problem with it, I shouldn’t either, although I’m not sure how good of a head space my dad is in, he didn’t deal with my mom’s death very well either.

1,"AITA For suggesting to give the cat up for adoption because we've got a dog? | We've had our cat since 2013. It's a lovely indoor cat, and everyone in the family adores it very much. My brother got it as 'his' one Christmas and it has always stayed inside and loved how everyone was fighting to pet it, letting it sleep in their bed, give it food etc.. However, this January, we got a dog (Australian Shepherd) and these two don't get along. The dog really wants to get friends; it's eager to meet the cat and whines every time its name or ""cat"" is mentioned. The problem is that the cat doesn't want to be friends and despise the dog incredibly much. At night, it waits till 20 minutes after the lights turn off to stand outside the basement window to get let in. It will then eat its food in a rush, find a distant corner in the basement and when I wake up in the morning, it eats another portion food and rushes out. In the day, it hangs out in a neighbour's house. It's an old couple, and I know they love to have it visiting, but they don't pet it and strictly throws it out at 18:00.

We've of course forced the cat and dog to meet because we thought it'd help, but every time, the cat is stressed and unwilling to move whatsoever unless we take away the dog, after which it sprints to the nearest escape outside. Every time we've forced these ""therapy sessions"" down on them, the cat has not come back for 1-3 days. Thus, it has become very skinny and gathered a lot of ticks, fleas etc. and has slept outside. Although I know cats are not very social animals, I do feel bad that no one is petting the cat either: it comes in so late at night that everyone's asleep and leaves early in the morning, so no one can enjoy its presence. It seems to crave attention - when I give it its food, it purrs and begs to be cared for. All in all, I think it lives a bit of a poor life - we for sure didn't get a pet just to feed it and make it be stressed constantly.

I feel really horrible because I love that lovely cat and don't feel like it's fair to 'down prioritize' it so much because of the dog - especially now when the cat was there first. Therefore I suggested my family over dinner to give the cat up for adoption to a shelter, another family or talk to the neighbours if they wanted to invite into their home for good.

I booked a Bahamas trip this week for 4th of July weekend and was going to fly her down to where I live. I didn't ask first because I know she can choose when she works and I wanted to surprise her and figured I can always compensate her for not going to work.

""iT'S nOt mY fAuLt tHaT i'M nOt a cOmPuTeR-oBsEsSeD wEiRdO!"".     

Now that I have my own PC where my files are safe, I want revenge. I recently learned of a virus called Rensenware, which encrypts your files and forces you to score an absurdly high amount of points in Touhou Seirensen: Undefined Fantastic Object's Lunatic mode. This wouldn't prevent her from doing much, since she mostly plays only browser games. However, she wouldn't be able to look through her Gerard Way fan art collection. This virus also has a patch online that the developer released so you could decrypt your files without scoring all those points. So if my sister is good enough at Google, her problem will be solved quickly.    

So yeah, it won't affect her much. But it will be annoying as hell for her. Not as annoying as the viruses she installed were, though. WIBTA?",False,False
1,"AITA For Telling My Husband I Don’t Want Him Going on a Family Trip? | So here we go. 

My husband was talking to me about his day when he got home from work tonight. He told me that his uncle sent out a group text today letting everyone know about the dates of their annual ice fishing trip. (“Everyone” being my husband, my father-in-law, my husband’s grandpa, my husband’s other uncle and a close family friend.) I asked my husband when they were planning on going and my husband said January 16th through the 20th. I sort of looked at him for a second waiting for him to say, “But I know your birthday is on the 18th so I’ll figure something out so I can spend time with you on your birthday.” And that never came. So I said to him, “Do you know what day my birthday is?” He said he knows my birthday is on the 18th but he really wants to go on the trip. I asked him if there was another weekend that would work for everyone and he quickly shot it down by saying, “It’s not my cabin so I can’t control the date.” 

My feelings were really hurt so I just left the room and sat on the couch by myself for awhile. He later texts me from the other room saying, “Don’t be mad at me.” And I responded with “My feelings are hurt.” Later he came into the room and sat by me. I thought he was going to say something but he never did. We went to bed and as we were laying down I asked him, “So what is your plan for January then?” He just said that he wants to go on the trip. I asked him if he understood why that makes me upset and he responded with “We can just do something the weekend after.” I told him that I would like for him to be home for my birthday and don’t want to be home alone for my birthday either. He just said again “But I want to go on the trip” and I said “Well I want my husband to be with me on my birthday.” He just sighed and rolled over and said that we will talk about it in the morning. 

I understand that it’s a fun trip for him to go on and he gets to spend time with some people he doesn’t see too often. He gets excited for it every year and I know he can’t control the date. We will see what happens in the morning, but am I the antagonist for wanting my husband to be with me on my birthday?",False,False
0,AITA for not even tasting food my boyfriend made | I(m19) was staying over with my boyfriend. He told me he’d make dinner and went to kitchen. He called me after like half an hour. He made pasta with KETCHUP. What kinda monster does that. I told I didn’t want that and made sandwich for myself. He asked me to try it and I refused. For some reason he got so upset and wouldn’t talk to me at all.,False,False
0,"WIBTA for questioning my wife's sudden desire to make a drastic career change? | To give this situation some necessary context, here are some details of varying importance.

My wife is a pharmacist and I work in education. She brings home about $50,000/year and I bring home about $75,000. We're both in our early 30s and have been together for almost ten years now. We're in a comfortable situation financially.

Alright, let's begin with what my wife and I have found to be the bitter truth: she just does not like being a pharmacist. She absolutely hates it. Day after day she'll come home with a new complaint about something a patient or colleague did. One time a patient crumpled up a receipt and told her to throw it away. One time a patient pissed all over the toilet seat. One time a patient licked his fingers before counting money and handed the bills to her.

One of the more oddball stories was a patient grilled her for two hours on whether or not the eyedrops she had received might have shards of glass in them, and when my wife eventually said ""OK, why don't you just call the number on the box and ask their helpline?"" the patient blew up and called corporate to file a formal complaint.

So a few months ago, we decided that maybe just dealing with customers kind of sucked. I'd been there and could relate. I asked if she would try working in a hospital (no direct contact with patients), and she agreed to try it out. She has worked there a month now, and the only thing that has changed is the nature of her complaints. She doesn't like her boss and she doesn't like her immediate supervisor. She doesn't like how busy it is there. She actually probably hates it more than her old job because at least in her old pharmacy, she could take a break every so often.

A lot of her complaints are valid. Some of them seem a bit ridiculous--things that have happened to me and didn't even blip on my radar. I think most of it stems from the fact that, again, she really just doesn't like being a pharmacist.

So at this point we have basically tried all career avenues of pharmacy, and nothing is quite doing it for her. She wants to get into something else. I've repeatedly told her that I would be supportive of her career change if she thought it would make her happier, and she frequently seeks permission from me.

Last Sunday, she suddenly came to me and said she wanted to be an esthetician at a women's spa. This wasn't exactly the most surprising thing in the world, as I know my wife loves beauty products/skincare related fields, but ... an esthetician? I mean absolutely no disrespect to estheticians as I know it's a job that requires a hell of a lot more than what I do at mine, but I can already hear her complaints about future customers. 

Of course this is a huge step for my wife. She is horrible at making decisions. I don't want to squash her dreams, as she seems really enthusiastic about this, but I have a really strong feeling that she's making a classic mistake. It's like loving Disneyland so much that you decide to work there, and all of a sudden you're stacking boxes in the back of the gift shop. I feel like her reasons for going into this career are all wrong and that we're going to be back in the same spot in a year, just with a whole lot of new problems and another job thrown into the ""not for me"" pile. And in the time, she will be taking a fairly massive salary hit. I agreed to support us, and I know I can, but the job offer she has is not offering her all that much at all.

I'm honestly inclined to just start bringing up doubts about it, but knowing her personality, she would probably just give up on it. She actually seems excited to work there though and while I don't want to make her feel bad, but I really want to get this off my chest. I'm going against what I promised her, but I have serious doubts about this career choice for her. I'm frankly against the idea and want to tell her but feel like IWBTA.

1,"AITA for asking my sister why she is still unemployed and how she is going to survive the real world? | My sister has been unemployed since spring. She is 21. She kept quitting and getting new jobs because of her perceived problems with her workplaces and managers. Her fiance works two jobs but I cannot imagine he makes more than 50k a year. While 50k is enough to live on, it is kinda hard. My husband and I make 80k combined and will soon be making 100k but we still have bills to pay and don't have that much leftover although we live comfortably. She also dropped out of school like 2 years ago because ""she didn't like it."" She quit the sports team she got recruited on as well. She would have been able to get a real job and make alot more money if she graduated. She says that she just wants to be a freeloader now and is not applying to jobs. She also says she has stopped talking to people because she ""doesn't like them."" I asked why she is waiting to apply to jobs, asked her what her interests are so I could suggest jobs that would be good for her, and why she can't be nice to people. She said I was being a rude bitch. I then asked her how she is going to live in the real world if she continues like this and she said she doesnt even know what I'm talking about. AITA?",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I didn't attend a friends dinner because of a no meat rule? | I know how that title reads so bear with me. First and foremost, I have no issue with people who do not eat meat. Hell, my diet is almost exclusively vegetarian at this point. Back to the story at hand, everyone in my social circle is wrapping up their degree and getting their first job. 

It's become a bit of a tradition that when one of us gets a job, we take everyone out somewhere for dinner. We were discussing this last night and one of our friends (who we'll call S) piped up with no meat at my dinner. Now, S is very religious and refuses to eat meat. I asked him rhetorically why he'd impose a rule as we've all had dinner before and it's never been an issue. 

He responded with ""I don't want to spend any of my money on non vegetarian products"". Fair enough, I can get that. So I asked what if we had a separate tab that we paid for and he shut that down. ""What kind of person would I be if I had someone else pay at my dinner?"". 

I don't really mind the dude's beliefs (you do you man) but I don't like to have other people impose their beliefs on me. Now, I'd initially let it go until today when another friend (in the same social circle) and I headed out to get some tea and he pipes up with ""Man, S was really pissing me off last night. He's free to have his own beliefs but don't force them down our throats, yeah? If that's the case then fuck it, I'm not gonna go"". 

It got me thinking - would we be the assholes if we didn't go despite trying to come up with a ""peaceful"" solution? I mean, I get where he's coming from but like I said, don't impose your beliefs like that on others. 

INFO for anyone that might request it : we all live on campus and the meat served here is of questionable quantity, which is why we go out once a month where the meat quality is a lot better.",False,False
1,"AITA for not inviting people to a party in the name of exclusivity? | I threw a party this Sunday, since we had Monday off school (for non-Americans, Monday was Labor Day, a holiday where you get a day off). It was a party I've been planning for weeks, to make it as fun as possible. My goal isn't to throw some humdrum party that'll be forgotten a week after, but rather to throw something everybody will be talking about for a while. 

A big part of that is keeping the party exclusive- if you invite everyone, it loses that cache and that sense of mystery. Essentially, what I did was hype up the party by getting my friends to spread hella  rumors about it. Then, I made the party strictly invitation only and distributed invitations individually on random days- a few would be handed out a few weeks beforehand, a few the week before, even a few the day of the party. You get the idea. This increased the mystery, and everyone was a) talking about the party and b) asking to be invited. 

The party ended up going great, but everyone who didn't get invited is pissed at me. Especially so is this guy in my AP Euro class that I talk to occasionally. He's been acting really angry at me since Tuesday, claiming that as 'friends', I should have invited him to the party.

I replied that 1) talking to someone sometimes in class doesn't mean you're friends and 2) I didn't invite all my friends to the party anyways. 

He called me an asshole for excluding people. I don't think I am. It's at my house, and I spent my money to throw this party (technically it's my dad's house and his money, but you know what I mean), so I can invite and not invite whoever I want.

0,"AITA if at the movie theater I didn't move my legs when the person in front of me hit them every time he leaned back? | For context, I'm 6'4"" and the movie theater I was at is pretty old, so it has slightly smaller seats than what you find at a newer chain like AMC. The movie was also almost four hours long. Sitting in a comfortable position (slightly slouched with my butt on the front half of my seat), my knees were maybe 2 or 3 inches from the seat in front of me. 

A few times, the guy sitting in front of me (hereafter Gumby, since he needed to stretch so often) would stretch and lean back really far in his seat, causing it to bump against the front of my knees. This doesn't really bother me, since it only happened two or three times in the first hour of the film. But, it evidently bothered Gumby a lot, because he then started to lean back repeatedly in fairly quick succession, hitting my knees each time. Then, he started to continuously push back, so that his seat was pushing back against my knees for a few minutes. 

At this point, the message was clear to me – Gumby wanted me to move my legs. For me, the issue was twofold: my thighs are fucking long so I didn't really have a lot of space to move them without encroaching on the leg space of my neighbors or sitting up uncomfortably straight, and I didn't particularly *want* to move them since I was comfortable and enjoying the movie (or at least, I was).

Around the two hour mark, Gumby began complaining, in a hushed but not inaudible tone, about me to his two seatmates (his mom and his boyfriend, I think?), who both subsequently glared at me. Around the 2.5 hour mark, he put his feet on the (unoccupied) seat in front of him and started to push backwards, this time hitting my knees pretty hard. He did this three or four times. At the three hour mark, Gumby seemed to be asleep for about a half hour, and then the last half hour or so of the film was more of the same feet-on-the-chair pushback.

I got some pretty dirty looks from Gumby's group after the film ended, and clearly they thought that I am the asshole. I feel like I didn't really do anything wrong – sure, I could have moved my legs somewhat, but it would have been uncomfortable for me to do so.

So am I the asshole?",False,False
1,"AITA for wanting my $3K? | I’m 18 and in college. The first year was paid for by federal aid and scholarships thank god, but I know that won’t cover it forever. My biological father was just arrested for $3,000 in back pay for child support he owed. I found out from my sister on his side and asked my mom about it. She confirmed he had been arrested and told me all of it had been paid because the government took it from his taxes. Being in college and knowing that child support was meant to support me, I was excited that I might be able to set that aside for college or use it to fix my car (speedometer is out, etc) or use it for things like groceries since I’m between jobs (I was just laid off my temporary job). 

So I asked about it, like when I’d get to see it. She then told me that it was being used for bills and “a roof over our head” and food because she doesn’t get food stamps anymore. I mentioned it’d be nice to put it towards college. She said it wouldn’t stretch very far and that she had used it to buy me a few things as well as stuff they needed. 

She had already used it. She had already had it and didn’t tell me. She won’t get more than a part time job and decided to use that $3,000 meant to support me to support herself instead without even telling me. AITA for saying I wanted it?",False,False
1,"AITA for expecting my wife to pay to repair my guitar | I’ve always loved guitars, which my wife has always known. I found a decently priced one (still several thousand dollars, won’t name the model for anonymity) and bought it with my wife’s agreement. When I got it, my wife told me in passing that I should put a lock on my office door where I keep my guitar to keep the kids out. She only told me once, and it didn’t get done. I’ve only had it for a week.

My wife stays home with our kids, who are all toddler age. She also waitresses at night for some extra money. She was home with the kids and wasn’t watching them all properly and one got into my office and knocked the guitar over. It will cost several hundred dollars to repair (and a repair already feels like a compromise because it will never be the same.) 

I feel that my wife should work extra shifts and my mother can watch the kids during the day so my wife can make the money to repair the guitar because it wouldn’t have been damaged had she been watching the kids properly. She thinks it’s my fault for not putting a lock on the door, but it had only been a week. She wants me to wait and save up my fun money to repair the guitar.

0,"AITA for not wanting to be my neighbors doorman? | So I am hanging at home tonight with my fiance (apartment building with 4 units) and the door buzzer goes off at 9PM. We are not expecting anyone and this happens all the time - sometimes as late as 10. Probably at least 50 times in the 4 months we've been here. We usually just ignore it. 

We had thought previously there might be an issue with the buzzer system or maybe that people were just buzzing all the apartments to get in....who knows. So this time my fiance gets pissed and says through the speaker to whoever it is to stop. They keep buzzing for about another 10 seconds so I go out to the door and it is my neighbor across the hall. We have said hello to each other before but that is that. 

She says (super bitchy-like) ""yeah, hi I'm not buzzing to be a bitch, I need to get in"" - I say whatever and apologize for my fiance not buzzing her in but say ""this happens all the time and we weren't expecting anyone"". 

She starts in that her boyfriend wasn't responding to her buzzer or her calls and that they only had one key. From time to time she needs to buzz our door so she can get in. I clarify that she has been doing this for a while, she confirms.

I say ""a heads up or clarification that you would be doing this would have been nice"" and she responds ""I DONT HAVE YOUR NUMBER DUDE.""...lol - they have had plenty of time to exchange info if they needed a favor!!

Again I tell her we weren't expecting someone and it's a little late to just get a random buzz. She responds with ""ITS ONLY 9PM!""

At this point I'm pissed and have so many things to say but instead I just shake my head and go for the door. 

She says ""WHATEVER DUDE"" and I head in.

A. Get another key made! It takes 5 minutes at Walmart. You're a mother for christ' sake.

1,"AITA for not being able to fulfill my bridesmaid duties due to anxiety? | Here's the thing. This happened a couple of years ago, but it's always weighed on me heavily and I want to know who's the asshole in this situation.

A couple of years ago my cousin asked me to be her bridesmaid. 
I agreed but felt it was just for show since she barely talked to me and it was super awkward at the bachelorette party and bridal shower, like she barely acknowledged me.  One day we went for a drive and she told me how two girls backed out of her bridal party and she couldn't bear if one more person did. She knew I had bad anxiety and asked me on the spot to tell her if I could do it or not. 
Of course I felt like how could I let her down so I said yes I would do it. 

Months go by and the wedding is getting closer and my anxiety is getting worse and worse. I can barely leave the house and my medication isn't working like it used to. I know the wedding is approaching and is in a big church which causes me more anxiety. Like I was literally making myself sick over this. Could barely go to work or anything. 

Finally it's about the time for the wedding and I break down crying to my aunt (her mother) who I tell that I don't think I can do it but don't want to let everyone down. My family isn't very understanding of mental health. My aunt says don't worry, try to make it, do some practice at the church and if you can't make it no problem we will get you a new dress and you can just do the reception. I felt a bit better but was still struggling, I wanted to be able to do this. My aunt drives me to the church, which was locked and I walked around a bit, very shaky, very anxious and she was getting frustrated and so I acted like I was ok. 

The day of the practice comes the day before the wedding and I'm throwing up and feeling so sick due to my anxiety, I've barely been sleeping. I break down to my family and told them I don't think I can do it. My aunt calls me and said in a very serious tone  "" I talked to your cousin and we both feel like you need to be there. So get ready"". At this point I'm breaking down. My cousin shows up at my place and I'm crying my eyes out and she's like cmon lets go, and I try to explain but she just looks at me with disgust and leaves. At this point my grandmother calls me and yells, your aunt called and said no wedding no reception. That broke me, my aunt broke her word and I felt so lost. So anxious. It didn't help that my boyfriend was away at work, so I had no one. I called a friend who drove me to my boyfriends house and his mom was amazing.

1,"AITA for showing up with flowers at the workplace of the girl I'm literally dating? | I met the most amazing girl a few weeks ago off a dating app. We've been on two dates and I feel like she's so easy to get along with and super cool. For the first date we met up for drinks and I felt like I could talk to her for hours. We've been texting since and she came to a small kickback the other day that I was throwing with some friends. 

It felt like she was starting to get busy after our second date and we weren't texting as much but I understood as she has a lot going on at work. I suggested I'd pay for an expensive date as a way to cheer her up but she's humble and declined saying that she couldn't let me pay that amount of money for her on a date to which I told her she's worth it and she didn't respond. I've been thinking about her non stop and can tell that she's been super stressed at work based on the way she's been texting (or the lack thereof). 

I texted her the other day telling her I really missed her and that I want to see her and treat her. She responded back saying she just has a lot on her plate right now. I hate to see her hurting so I bought some flowers. We work/live in the same area and she works at a popular tech company so I went to the building she mentioned that she worked at and asked reception to buzz her. They got on the phone with her and after they hung up they told me that she's unavailable.

I tried to text her after but the message ""green texted"" (which means someone blocked you on iMessage). I thought maybe she had her phone up but my girl friend said she probably blocked me and that I'm a giant asshole for ""not leaving her alone"".

0,"AITA for telling my daughter ""That's what happens when you don't listen"" after she got hurt? | My husband’s family had a reunion this weekend. Part of that, was renting out a room of this restaurant on Saturday afternoon. It had a really long oak table where we were all seated. My daughter (10) kept tipping her chair backwards and forwards throughout the meal. I told her several times to not do that, because she was going to get hurt. She would stop for a bit, then do it when I wasn’t looking or I would hear her trying to impress a cousin or something. Finally, I just figured, natural consequences are going to happen. I had warned her enough times and she’s not a toddler.

Sure enough, she ended up bashing her chin on the table. She wasn’t hurt badly and she didn’t require stitches or anything, but she was bleeding a bit, it’s left a mark that’s shown for a few days. When it happened, she looked at me wide eyed. I got up, said “I’ll get you something to clean it up, but this is what happens when you don’t listen.”, before walking away to ask the waiter for some wipes and a band aid (all it really needed upon inspection).

Now, I’m going to say that my BIL (husband’s brother) and SIL (that brother’s wife) are very close with my kids, they love ‘em to death. They’re childless by choice but they’re their godparents and if anything were to happen, they’ve said that they’d take them. So, I know they just love the kids. However, my SIL got mad at my reaction. She said I completely undermined my daughter’s “feelings” and that I should’ve shown her more care. For context, when I came back to the table, she had been fussing over my daughter and my daughter was crying about how much it hurt, something she hadn’t been doing when I walked away. In my opinion, she only did that because SIL made a big deal of it and I told my SIL so. She was fine and even when I talked to my daughter later, she said that she was fine, she was just overwhelmed. If my daughter had been crying when it happened, I wouldn’t have been as harsh as I was in the moment, but we would’ve had the talk later. My SIL still thinks I was an ass.

1,"AITA for going to a pre-planned vacation with my family rather than my boyfriend's mom's funeral? | I'm a teacher so I get about 2 months off every summer but my mom, sister, aunt, and cousin all work regular 9-5 jobs with 2-3 weeks off a year, so it's really difficult to organize time for trips where we can all go. We managed to schedule a girls trip to Cabo from June 1st to 9th. Made payments (almost $3K a person) several weeks prior to the trip and were all very excited to go to Mexico and bond -- I'm best friends with my sister & cousin, and my mom and aunt are identical twins so we're all a very close group.

My boyfriend & I have been together for 2 years. His family lives across the country so I only see them twice a year and it's usually pretty quick. No real one-on-one bonding with anyone in his family but we're all definitely friendly with one another. We like each other's posts on FB/IG, send happy birthday wishes, stuff like that. 

A few days before we left, my boyfriend's mom passed away unexpectedly. I spent days attached to his hip, supporting him, wrote the email to his work explaining what happened, cleaning the apartment, making sure he ate, called his dad & siblings and expressed my condolences, booked his flight, helped him pack, etc. He asked me to go to the funeral with him. I felt so, so, so bad telling him no. I hardly knew his mom and feel like I already committed myself to the trip with my family. He was heartbroken and begged me to go with him for support but I told him that his whole family is there and if anything it's a special time for them all to recount memories of their mother/wife/sister/daughter. 

He asked if he gave me $1500 ""could you go on the trip sometime later? you have two more months off. I know you won't get some deposits back, so I'll give you this money"" and I honestly felt so bad but the thing isn't the money (although obviously as a teacher, I'm not swimming in money) but it's about how this is the *one* time a year that the women I'm closest to can go together.

My mom & aunt told me ""we want you to come with us, but it's ultimately up to you"" whereas my cousin & sister were like ""you should definitely come with us, it'll ruin the trip for us if you're not there, just come, etc.""

My boyfriend was upset and left mad at me, I called/texted a bunch but he didn't respond until days later, anyways I went to Mexico and came back on the 9th and things have been weird with us. Sometimes he's really close with me like usual other times I can tell he's mad I didn't go with him. He said he's not furious at me but just disappointed and sad that I chose to go party instead of be there with him.

0,"WIBTA if I don’t sell my car to a lady who has cancer? | First time poster here, long time lurker, all that jazz. 

I have an older car that no longer meets my needs. It would take a fair bit of money and work to get it up and running again. I have the resources but I don’t want to put in the time or money, when I could just sell it to someone who could do the work themselves (or even junk it for a couple hundred bucks).

My stepmom told her friend that I’ve got a beat up old car for cheap. I’ve done some back and forth with this lady and she doesn’t have a big budget because she has cancer. She just needs something to get from point A to B. 

If I were to sell to Cancer Lady (sorry if that sounds rude), I would have to put in the work, the money, and then tow it 200 miles to where she lives. I’m only looking to get about $500-$800 out of it, but if I sell her the car I probably won’t make any money at all. 

I’m not entirely worried about the money. But I do work 50 hours a week and freelance on the side; towing it to her city alone would put me out ~$150 as well as taking up my only day off during the week. I know there’s plenty of people here in my town who would pay what I’m asking and do the work themselves. 
I can’t help but feel like maybe it’s not morally the best choice to have wasted this lady’s time to get a little more $$.

0,"AITA for telling my family that I was a bitter kid because of how they treated my sister? | I’m 22 and female, and have a half sister who is 26 in May. I’ve always been bitter about how I grew up, because my mom and my sister’s dad spoiled her rotten. It was a contest between my mom and sister’s dad to see who could spoil sister the most, which led to me not getting to do much of anything, because mom spent more money on my sister than me. 

For example: I was in middle school, and planning on taking band. My sister was in high school, and had a trip to some place for a week. Mom decided to spend a good few thousand dollars on my sister going on that trip, and when I needed money to rent an instrument for band, I got told I was shit out of luck. It was like this for pretty much everything in my childhood. It was also like this when it came down to college.

The other day, I was video calling my mom and sister, and mom was talking about how bitter I was as a child. I made a passive aggressive joke that it was because of what my mom did while I was a kid. My sister asked what I meant by that, and I laughed and asked her how she didn’t know. She still didn’t get it, so I basically said, “You got to do everything you wanted as a kid, and mom made sure you never went without, even though your dad would’ve had you covered. But I always went without.” 

My sister and my mom got mad at me. My mom said I was a brat and didn’t deserve half as much as my sister got because of that, and my sister told me I was just hateful. I told them that they made me feel worthless in comparison to my sister because of that, and that it was embarrassing to have to grow up with my sister who’s being handed everything on a silver platter, and then there’s me who got nothing. I also brought up the fact that my mother decided it would be a good idea to pay for my sister to go to an ivy league college, and refuse sister’s dad’s help, and that she basically told me I was on my own when it came to my college. I also brought up the fact that my mother’s planning on paying for my sister’s wedding, and asked her if she’d do the same for me.

They hung up, and then later I got a text from my sister saying that I was an asshole, and that she’d never speak to me again. AITA for telling my family that I was a bitter kid because of how they treated my sister?",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I gave away a necklace which my great grandmother owned as opposed to letting my daughter-in-law have it? | This is my first reddit post outside of my regular subreddits so I hope I am following all of the rules. I am happy to edit if necessary. 

There is a long history regarding this necklace, it's an Opera length necklace my great grandfather purchased for my great grandmother when they were in Europe in the early 1930s. They were quite wealthy but lost everything because of the depression and war and the necklace is pretty much all I have of their legacy. 

I have never gotten along with my Daughter-in-law. She has been a continuous pain in my side since the day she sauntered into my life and she has done a spectacular job of turning my son against me. The only thing she has done to benefit me is give me my beautiful grandchildren but we are on what she calls ""limited contact"" because I feel it's a grandparent's job to spoil the grandchildren and she won't allow it. I know for certain my daughter-in-law is a gold digger because she continuously complements me on the things that me and my late husband bought (our home for example) and derides me for the way I spend money with my live-in. But I can tell from her tone of voice, it's a ""grabby"" type of compliment and not genuine. 

Of course one of the things wants is the necklace. Against my better judgment I let her borrow it once and she could not stop talking about how it ""made her outfit"" and the most phony thank you I've ever heard from a person. I vowed with my live-in that day she would never get the necklace. I am planning on giving it to a friend's daughter-in-law who is much more loving and gracious then the disaster my son decided to marry. 

My son is furious with me. He thinks I'm giving away a family legacy and they ""worst"" that's going to happen is my granddaughter is going to get it. What he doesn't see is that my daughter-in-law is going to sell it for scrap the second my back is turned. My son accuses me of being ridiculous but I just don't see it like that. 


No matter what it's my necklace and I can do what I want with, but before I officially ""turn it over"" I would like to get a neutral opinion. Thank you for reading.",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting to reimburse my sister for an iPad she bought for me? | So, my older sister (31) works at a big tech company in the city with a lot of gadget-happy people. I (F, 27) have recently been looking at buying an iPad, as I travel a lot for my own job and it would be nice to watch Netflix on something other than my phone.

She messaged me on Monday to let me know that someone in her workplace was selling an iPad for $100. It wasn't the most recent model but it was still in the box and had only been used a couple of times, so I said I'd take it (the culture in her workplace is pretty tight-knit, so no one would ever sell something defective).

She bought the iPad on my behalf and I said I'd pay back her the next day, when we were due to meet up for a family dinner thing. She messaged me the next morning when she got into work and said that the iPad had been stolen overnight. I asked what she meant and she said that she had left it on her desk before she went home for the evening, and someone must have taken it in the meantime.

She reported it to her boss and there was a short investigation but nothing was found (since it wasn't company property that was stolen, they didn't really give a shit). The building's internal CCTV only covers the corridors, but not the desks, so there was no way of seeing who might have taken it.

Since my sister left it on her desk and didn't think to take it home, I've been reluctant to give her the $100. She's really upset with me about this, as she and her husband have two small kids and a mortgage to pay (they're just about making ends meet, she lent me the $100 because she knew I would pay her back the next day). But my job doesn't pay that great either and I don't want to pay $100 for something that she just left on her desk. She claims that she ""didn't think it was that kind of  workplace"", but I think it was negligence on her part.

She's already gotten our parents involved. Our dad is siding with me and our mom thinks I'm a monster who is trying to steal food directly out of her grandbabies' mouths.

1,"AITA for letting my neighbor’s dogs runaway? | My neighbor “David” has been living next to us for the past ten years. Over these years, they’ve had 3 dogs which they keep out most of the time. They are obnoxiously loud, bark all morning and night until they’re brought in. The neighbor beside him who is my friend has been annoyed by it but when he confronted David about it, he just told him that he can’t control his dogs or bring them inside because they have dirt all over them and bring mud in from the yard. 

I recently got a job at a hospital a few years ago but the hours have been 7p-7a. Unfortunately, David has his dogs out around 6am every day when he leaves for work and they start barking and barking at the most insignificant things. I get it, they are dogs. That’s what they do. 

Anyway, I went over to his place finally and just gave it to him straight. I told him I work nights and would appreciate it if he could bring his dogs in just until noon or something since it’s hard for me to sleep with them barking. I don’t mind him letting them out for a bit but just not all day. I told him I’ve tried wearing earplugs (only in one ear because I can’t do both) and switching rooms but I still hear them. 

All he said was it’s the morning when everyone is awake and I have to deal with it because he can’t do anything about it. I asked if his wife (who’s a stay at home) could do me a favor and just let them out for a bit and take them back in but he said it’s not her problem. 

I never knew out of the ten years living beside him he would be that arrogant. If I was in his shoes, I think I would be considerate of someone who works nights and sleeps during the days. That’s just me. 

Anyway, I noticed a few weeks ago while coming back from work that his dogs were out of the fence and in the front yard. They saw me in my car and immediately started following me and barking. I didn’t know if his wife was outside somewhere or David himself, but after just stalling there for a few minutes I realized that they might have gotten out. So instead of parking my car, I slowly drove around the street with them following me as I was waving my hand at them. I got to a different street which is connected to the main road and then left, turned around and went back home. 

The following day when I woke up I didn’t hear anything. I assumed they got lost, and that’s what happened. I heard the doorbell ring in the afternoon while I was asleep and looked out the window to see who it was. It was David. I’m assuming looking for his dogs. I ignored it. I then see posts around the neighborhood looking for all three dogs saying they are lost. 

Now today, they still haven’t found them.  He did see me in person on my week off one day to tell me what happened and to look out for them, but I told him that’s it’s not my problem. He should’ve secured his fence. He told me to go fuck myself to which I did.",False,False

1,"AITA for defending my cats behavior. | Throwaway 

Backstory first. I have a boyfriend and we have a pet cat named Ricky. We also have 3 roomates, 2 of which are dating. The couple also has 2 cats and a lizzard for pets.
Lizzard is name lizzie. This will be relevant. 

So this morning I woke up and went into the living room and saw the lizards cage dismantled but the lizard was in the empty tank. I asked my male roomate whats up, and he told me my cat got into the lizards cage and messed up the tank and stressed out the lizzard. Ricky has an obsession getting into this lizard tank. The tank is very large and has a cover/lid on it. But it also has a 4 inch hole in the corner that my cat can get into. So to stop him, we put a tea pot on top of the hole, my cat is not smart enough to knock it off.  They (2 roomates that are dating) recently cleaned the tank, but forgot to put the tea pot on the hole. So when my cat jumped on the tank saw the opening, and took advantage of the situation.

My male roomate was stressed but also chill, knowing it was an accident. I asked if Ricky and lizzie were fine, which they are. No one is hurt. I thought this was the end of it. This is not the first time ricky got into lizzie tank. He has never hurt her but I wouldn't trust him alone with her. Every time he got in is because they move the tea pot and not cover the hole back up. 

Turns out my female roomate is making passive aggressive post on Facebook, messaging mutual friends if me and my boyfriend can live with them, and had a huge fight with my boyfriend on our friend group chat. 

Shit went down. She told us to move out basicly tonight, that it was our fault, she brought up stuff like how our cat ricky ruined their stuff in the past. 
I can bring up plenty of situations when their cat ruined my and my boyfriends stuff, but I get cats do cat stuff and moved on. 

I'm about to flip shit. I understand she is upset about lizzie. But to bring up past things we talked about and moved on? I really want to post on Facebook because she's trashing our names without actually saying our names. 

So would AITA for my cats behavior and not taking this seriously because it was an accident and no pet was hurt? And WIBTA if i try to defuse the situation both on fb and our group chat?

So my cousin is getting married, and she’s being a pretty relaxed bride. We are pretty close so she asked me to be one of her bridesmaids, and I accepted happily. She has pretty relaxed rules for us, and her only requirements for the bridesmaid dresses were that they had to be short and be light pink (she gave us one of those swatch things to get a correct color).

I looked in about 2 malls over a weekend and got frustrated because I couldn’t find a SINGLE dress that matched the color, length requirement, and was under like $200.

I ended up going home and was scrolling through Instagram, and I saw a promo for fashion nova (an online clothing store), so I decided to go on there and just see what they had to offer because I was desperate.

I ended up finding a really cute dress that met the requirements, and it was only $25 (not even the sale price). I bought the dress immediately and was super excited because I could use the money I saved from not buying a more expensive dress on other things.

The dress came in and I tried it on for my cousin (I invited her over), and she was pretty upset. She said that she kind of expected that I would get a higher quality dress because I’m a bridesmaid. I thought that the dress was fine, it was simple, I’ll admit that, but it was the color and length that she wanted, so I don’t see why she was upset, especially if I had to pay for the dress myself.

I find other women attractive, but I don’t advertise it to her. What good does that do?

When they were ready to administer it, they led him over to a little cubby (not a ton of room for multiple people) where they would give him the shot.

This is exactly how the dialogue went from there:

Me: Do you mind if I come in there?

Pharmacist: Uhhh sure, is he scared of shots or something

Me: No, I just want to make sure he isn't getting injected with insulin or something like that (a little crass maybe)

Pharmacist: \*Blank stares at my brother then me after hearing that, holds up the vaccine so I can see it but she has a very clear look on her face that she's annoyed at what I just said\*

Me: Thank you (In response to her holding it up)

Pharmacist: \*After a long pause\* Next time you want to question your pharmacist, go to your doctor's office instead (assuming she meant that I should get the vaccine at a doctor's office, not that I needed to see a doctor as an insult or something like that. But again, a very condescending and annoyed tone)

Me: \*Realizing I might have fucked up\* Do you really think thats an unreasonable request? Vaccine swaps have happened before, I just want to make sure its actually the flu vaccine.

She’s about 21 and constantly raises her hand to share information or stories she has that are vaguely related to the topic but has no meaningful impact on the class. Almost every time she speaks in class, she stutters or trips over words, not a speech issue just because she speaks to fast, I think. Only once has she raised her hand to answer the teacher's question and that was a welcomed experience honestly. Most of the time when she raises her hand to speak in class it’s unnecessary and it’s gotten tiring. It happens at least once every class period. The teacher has started to give her a *look* and she’s started to cut her off mid-sentence to resume class. When she gets cut off other students snicker. I’m unsure if she notices it or not, but it hasn’t stopped her from raising her hand.

Some examples:

* 1st day, we had to share basic information and a fact about us. Most people say “I play basketball” “My favorite color is blue” etc. She goes on to say “I’m a fiery Irish redhead with freckles and passion and…”  It goes on and on.
* Topic was prenatal development and the lecture mentioned how drugs and alcohol affect the fetus the most in the first 12 weeks. The girl raises her hand to something along the lines of “oh I just want to say that if you ask a nurse that deals with pregnancies, she’ll tell you that drugs and alcohol will actually affect your baby throughout the pregnancy.” As if that’s not pretty much baseline knowledge.

My best friend (V) just got her four month old puppy three months ago. This is her first time having a pet, so she is a little overprotective of him and would worry over the littlest things that could harm him. However, there is no doubt that she loves him and cares for him and will do anything for him. She also just seemed to be so much happier once she got him. 

A few of weeks ago, the puppy got really sick.

And the vets weren’t really sure what was going on and if he’d make it. She was devastated and started blaming herself. She began getting anxious and worried and said she doesn’t know what she would do if she lost him and I could tell she wanted to cry. 

I told her that thankfully, she hasn’t had him for that long and if the worst were to happen to him, she will be able to move on quicker. I reminded her that I lost my dog of over 10 years a little over a month ago and that I am still dealing with that, so hopefully she can find comfort in knowing that she can recover more quickly than I have because she hasn’t had him that long. She kind of just shrugged and said “yeah, maybe” and that she had to go. 

I hadn’t really heard from V after that for a couple of days and asked another friend of ours if she had spoken or heard from her. Thankfully, the puppy has made a full turnaround and is slowly getting back to his playful self, but right now V is a little hurt by the comment I made. I thought it was silly and I was only trying to make her feel better. Our mutual friend told me my comment is insensitive to say to anyone, but especially V because of how good the puppy has been for her (she’s been struggling with PTSD and depression). 

I just feel like V totally took my comment out of context or misinterpreted what I was saying. This whole thing is kind of stupid and if they would just let me explain what I meant then they would realize that she was upset over nothing. 

Did my friend overreact or am I actually the jerk here?",False,False
1,"AITA For Not Wanting My Dads GF And Kids At A Funeral? | Basically, my parents are separated, not divorced. They are still married and my dad has been dating this woman, 'L'. She has two daughters as well, and my dad has pretty much consistedly chosen 'L' over me. This has created tension and a strain on everybody, especially my relationship with my father and I. He has basically refused to compromise over seeing her and seeing me, and she is over basically 24/7. Recently, my fathers dad passed away and the funeral is soon. I'm relatively heartbroken over it. My mom is going to go (as that was her father in law for many years.) and now my dad is bringing his girlfriend. In the obituary, after my dads name, it said 'L's name as well and my mother is livid about it, as she was his daughter in law and mom of his grand children, it should be her name. My father is inviting his girlfriend and her children despite the fact that the funeral is very intimate (closest family only, with the exception of some of Opas friends) and they didn't know him AT ALL and despite the fact that I've protested against it and that it's going to make my mother uncomfortable. AITA for not wanting them to come because of the strain it would put on my family?

It took everything in me to not burst out laughing in his face. I was thinking that what he’s saying makes no sense, even though he’s an American citizen, they have a large pool of overqualified applicants to choose from than to choose someone struggling to pass high school calculus. I have parent teacher interviews next week and spoke to his other teachers. He’s a good kid, but he’s just not cut out for a STEM field. He’s doing good in his English course and chemistry class. But he’s marginally passing AP physics, his space science course, and my class. 

I am speaking to his parents next week since they scheduled a parent teacher interview. Right now he’s not even eligible for any university’s engineering program in Canada or USA since you need atleast 70% in the prerequisites. I feel like he’d excel more in another field, or even trades. I was planning on showing his parents his tests and his grades and telling him that he opened up to me of wanting to work at Tesla or SpaceX.

1,"AITA for crushing my brother's hopes by telling him he most likely won't get into any top colleges? | Sorry if this comes off as flexing from my side. That wasn't what I was trying to do, since I'm just here to seek other perspectives on this situation with my brother. Also I'm really sleep deprived and have just pulled two all-nighters in a row, so sorry if anything I said doesn't make sense.

&#x200B;

So, I'm a sophomore at Wharton right now, and my brother Elliot, a junior, is making a list of colleges to apply to next year. What I've found out when I saw his list is that he has *really, really unrealistic expectations.* As in, he's applying to only prestigious universities- all the Ivies, Stanford, Northwestern, Berkeley, etc without applying to any safety schools- and simply does not have the resume to get into them.

&#x200B;

Here's what I mean. I'm not an expert on college applications by any means, but as someone who got into a decent amount of good-to-decent schools (Penn, Columbia, Princeton, UChicago, USC, Duke, Vandy, UVA, UCLA), know a lot of other people who got into good schools, and have talked to admission officers/read my admission files, I'd say I have a decent idea of what it takes to get into a good college. And that thing is essentially uniqueness- almost everybody applying to top schools has good grades, top test scores, leadership positions at clubs, etc. So if you apply to top schools with just good grades and leadership positions in a few clubs, you'll do absolutely nothing to differentiate yourself from 90% of the people applying- and at schools that reject 80%+ of the applicants, being forgettable is deadly, and pretty much a guaranteed rejection. To get in, you almost always have to do something unique that makes you stand apart from everyone else.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, Elliot doesn't have anything to set himself apart- he's an impressive applicant by normal standards (4.5 GPA, 36 ACT, Captain of the Robotics team), but as I've already said, these stuff are not unique in any way shape or form. Almost everyone applying to these schools have these stats. Hell, I remember reading Ivies reject 3 out 5 valedictorians. My point is just that with these stats, he's not likely to stand out in these applications, and if he doesn't, he'll get rejected. And on top of that, he's a rich Asian guy applying as a math/CS major, which is a huge L. So the chances of rejected are hella high.

&#x200B;

When I told him, he got pissed and told me he didn't ask for my advice. That may be true, but I'm just trying to look out for him- he didn't apply to any safety schools (schools he's 90% going to get into, like state schools), so if he gets rejected from the prestigious, competitive schools he applies to, he'll literally have nowhere to go. so I don't think a little bit on unsolicited advice is wrong here- even if it hurts his feelings right now, convincing him his applications are a long shot is the only way to get him to apply to safeties, which is better for him long-term.

1,"WIBTA for not ending overseas vacation with my family early to go home to partner who’s family member died? | My wife’s father is very sick and I have vacation planned with siblings and own parents. We don’t ever really go on holidays and my own parents are ageing and it is just the family no partners. 
My sister mentioned it would be unfortunate if I had to fly back if her father died.
I was confused as to why I would have to do that and my sister seemed pretty shocked I wouldn’t be there for my partner.

The way I see it is I couldn’t do anything here or there if he passed. If my partner asked me to of course I would, but if they didn’t ask I wouldn’t. 

I don’t really want to ask my wife for fear or the appalled reaction I got from my sister. If I ask her about it she will know I’d just come back because she asked not because I believe it’s the right thing to do.

0,"AITA for being upset with my MIL for making Mother's Day about her only? | So background is basic r/justnoMIL stuff that isn’t super relevant here. What is relevant is that my husband and I have gone to counseling to learn to set proper boundaries with his mother and a couple months ago we had a “come to Jesus” with her implementing those boundaries. Since then things have been pretty good. She stills makes inappropriate comments or oversteps from time to time, but my husband nips it in the bud immediately and the issues seem less frequent. That being said, having put up with her antics for over 7 years, I am still super sensitive to her and tend to see the worst.

So to the issue- MIL is going out of town for Mother’s Day. She asks if we can all get together to celebrate early and she wants everyone to come so we can get pictures and share this day. Sure, no problem. We show up with cards and flowers ready to celebrate. 

When we arrive and throughout the meal, she makes it clear this is “her Mother’s Day” and she was sorry she’d be out of town on “my Mother’s Day”. Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t want anything from her. In fact, if she does something nice it will be held over your head forever. It just seemed weird that we all had to get together and make sure I understood we would ONLY be celebrating her motherhood on that day. I’m the mother of her only grandchildren - the most recent was born 8 months ago. It just couldn’t have been “happy Mother’s Day to all the moms here?” 

In my family, we celebrate all the mothers and the same goes for Father’s Day. I understand that every family is different and I want to respect that. This just felt purposely exclusionary if that makes sense?

My husband thinks his mom was being an asshole too, but he is sensitive to her as well. We haven’t said anything to his mom at this point so my question is- AITA for thinking MIL was being asshole?",False,False

My dad wasn't a particuarly bad person or anything, just a bit absent and a bit...timid? My mother was always more dominating and loud compared to him, so usually he was either just absent with work but didn't seem to really teach me any values of what it means to be a man. This lead me to becoming a bit of a pushover and naive person, people would take advantage of me and I fell into a bad crowd who got me into drinking all the time and using me for money etc. Eventually I read self-help books and got my shit together.

So I harbor no resentment for anyone, for many years I've been calm and blessed since I got those self-help books. 

So when I met up with my dad the other day for a drink, we were having a discussion about life in general and I said ''I don't think you taught me what it means to be a man.'' and he looked really shocked and sad when I said that. Now my sister found out and called me an asshole, but I don't think she understands really. AITA?",False,False

One of the classes had a new kid in it(I had no idea she was new) and the kid kept on misbehaving also wouldn't respond to me anytime I shouted her name and was being really sassy to me and saying she won't do things.

 Eventually when she started grabbing onto other kids I had had enough and told her to sit on the wall at the side for a few seconds until she was ready to listen. The kid then threw floats at me when sat on the wall and just as I was going to let her back in the pool she threw her armbands at me in a fit and started crying.

After the lesson she would not go to her mum and sat on the wall crying eventually I got a lifeguard to stand with her till her mum collected her. 

The mum went straight to my manager and complained saying I had not given her daughter any attention during the lesson and it was unfair that I sat her on the wall and that I had left her kid unattended and whatever else she said to make me look bad. She then took it further and emailed in aswell the next day. 
I told my manager my side of the story and he said the mum told him the kid had partial hearing loss. If I had known that I could have possibly reacted better to her behaviour.

Now I feel like pure shit and this parent wont drop this and my manager keeps bringing me back to ask more questions. I literally just burst into tears while typing this in the staff room now.

I’ve also been dating my current SO for about a year now, and she insists I have to change the picture.

&#x200B;

Recently I had an early morning shift starting at 5:30 am, I am not a morning person and was dead tired by the time of my first break, exhausted by lunch time. On my lunch break I very quickly stuffed my face full of food, set an alarm on my phone and tried to take a nap in the break room as it was the only spot I could do so.

&#x200B;

Sometime during my nap a coworker got the idea to play a small prank on me. I had my eyes closed and listened as she whispered (loudly) to another coworker that she was gonna get me with the air horn app on her phone.

&#x200B;

I thought that this would be a great time to get some preemptive revenge. So, when she got closer to me and started lifting her phone to my ear I jumped up out of my chair and shouted real loud.

&#x200B;

That made her lose her balance and fall over, she tried to catch herself and ended up pulling a table down on her hip among other small injuries. Nothing broken, no cuts, just some bruises as far as anyone has told me.

&#x200B;

The rest of the shift and the few days since she's been complaining to our managers that I'm abusive and rude. HR has stepped in and tried to resolve the issue. I have apologized for causing her injury, but feel that she was kind of asking for it by trying to scare me out of my nap. My coworkers are split on the issue; some think she deserved it, others think I'm a massive d-bag for it.

1,"AITA for not wanting to change my signature after I get married even though my current signature depicts my first name and the family name of my first boyfriend? | I made my signature when I was 14, and being the dumb tween that I was, I made it to be my first name (let’s say Mary) and the family name of my boyfriend at that time (let’s say Smith). My signature is very stylized so it’s not like I just write “Mary Smith” in cursive, and you can’t really make out the names Mary or Smith, only the letters M and S are obvious so most people don’t even know that that’s what I’m signing and not my actual name (let’s say Mary Stevens). I signed a lot of official documents using that signature over the years so I just stuck to it.

I told my fiancé the story about my signature back when we first started dating and he just laughed. Then yesterday he mentioned that now that we’re getting married I finally have an impetus to change my signature, and I was surprised because I actually don’t plan on changing it. When I told my fiancé that I was thinking of just keeping my signature, he looked at me like I was crazy and asked why on earth I want to keep signing the family name of my first ex when I will be married to him and take his last name.

It’s definitely not because I am still holding a torch for my first ex, I don’t even know where he is now. It’s just that I’ve used this signature for all my personal and professional identification and documents, I don’t want to go through the trouble of changing my signature on everything, and honestly I really like how my current signature looks.

I've never been happier and whilst she wanted a big glitzy wedding I managed to convince her to have a small affair in Scandinavia with family and close friends, then the money we saved can either go to a house deposit or our honeymoon.

We were having a talk this weekend and she wanted us to get all our secrets and issues out of the way so we could start the new decade and marriage with a clean slate. I found this odd but decided to do it anyway as I didn't have much to confess. 

When we were at university we had a period of about a month where we weren't speaking, we had a massive argument and whilst I remember clearly that we hadn't broken up or ""go on a break"" we weren't speaking to each other. The argument started because she was getting close to some guy and she wanted to open our relationship. I was totally against it and she finally agreed with me but wouldn't speak to me.

She confessed to me that during this 2 month period she went ahead with it anyway and in her words ""It was a mistake and made me realise how much I loved you"". I could understand if it had been one night, but for 2 months? No.

Eventually, whilst drunk, she admitted to my wife that she was in love with my wife. At this point, my wife told her that wasn’t appropriate, that she should talk to her own wife about this, and that they shouldn’t remain friends or talk. She then completely cut her off.

My stepbrother wanted to play on it. Him being so into it actually turned into a big help to distract him while I studied, so I made a new profile on it for him so he wouldn’t mess up my saves.

When I got back to school I eventually got annoyed with having to click on my profile each time I started a game and each time I went to the eshop. So I just deleted his profile.

So, this early this morning I got on the train to go to my dads for thanksgiving. I usually go home to my moms, but she and my stepdad are going to see his family and Im not up for going plane trip. Anyway I brought my switch again for the train ride.

When I told him I deleted it he started crying. Like not full on crying, but his eyes were watery a little and red. Now he’s holed up in his room.

The first rule we made when we started to plan this trip is that it would be childfree. The two people in our group that have children agreed that their children were young enough not to be traumatized from not going to Disney at 3 years old.

For personal reasons, one of my buddies had to drop out of the trip last minute. Since everything has been paid for, he said that if I could find someone to take his place he wouldn’t expect to be reimbursed in any way, except for sweets from Honeydukes and mouse ears.

I managed to find someone, but before I could say anything to the group. My girlfriend (hopefully soon to be fiancée, I plan to purpose on the trip) told me her sister wanted to take the empty spot. I asked how, because her sister just had a baby and at the time of the trip she will be 6 or 7 weeks. She said that her sister would just bring her daughter and we would make it work.

My girlfriend is a huge pushover when it comes to her sister and has never said no to her before.

She wouldn’t listen and started rambling about her daughter getting pictures with Mickey and Elsa (she also named her daughter Elsa btw) and how much fun she’ll have. I interrupted her and said that the trip was adults only and her newborn was not allowed. I then pointed out that a lot of the places we’ll be going to after the parks are adults only and no one would want to stay behind with her and the baby. Plus I don’t think an unvaccinated newborn should be taken to Disney.

I was called a dick and how dare I tell her how to parent her child and it was creepy that a bunch of adults wanted to go to Disney without children. The last thing I told her before I hung up was that the empty spot had already been taken, by someone, so sadly she cannot come, but we'll take plenty of pics in our coordinated disneybound outfits and wizard robes to show her later.  I think she cussed me out, before I ended the call.

My girlfriend thinks I was mean to her sister and said I should apologize for not giving her a chance to come on the trip. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for telling my best friend [22F] who has type 1 herpes that she should stick to using std/positive singles dating apps? | Hey!

So my best friend, we’ll call her Tracy, has type 1 herpes below the belt. She’s had it for about 4 years, doesn’t get outbreaks, and also doesn’t take meds for it. She recently confided in me about this.

I was trying to be helpful and give her advice and so I told her that it would probably be best for her to stay away from normal dating apps (like tinder, bumble, etc) because she’ll probably just face more rejection since dating on those apps is already hard enough. I told her she should make some accounts on the apps for people who are positive for STIs. 

Tracy was hurt that I said this because she said she’s tried those apps and they made her feel like a pariah and she also argued that 50% of people in the US have her type of herpes. To which I told her that yes, technically this is true, but most of those cases are oral aka cold sores.

This happened about a week ago and I can really tell that I hurt her feelings but I was just trying to be helpful. I mean, I really think most guys (at least at our age) just aren’t going to want to date someone with herpes, which sucks but is the unfortunate reality of the situation.

1,"WIBTA if i photoshopped my bridesmaids tattoos out of my wedding photos? | I’m getting married in 2 months and one of my bridesmaids has an arm full of tattoos. She has previously covered all of them with makeup for work events when it was absolutely essential. 

I asked her if she would cover them up for my wedding just to not draw attention to her and for pictures etc. She said she wouldn’t feel comfortable with that as it’s part of her identity and she doesn’t want to just for my ‘aesthetic’ wedding. 

I talked to my photographer and she said she could cover them in the photos in the editing process and give me some edited and unedited photos etc. I decided to do it. I mentioned to her that that was what I was going to do (I thought her problem was just not wanting to change herself for my wedding, I thought it would be fine to fix the photos).

1,"AITA for trying to reunite what I am CERTAIN is a set of identical, separated-at-birth twins? | In 2017 I moved in with 2 roommates from Craigslist in their mid-20’s, Heather & Jeff. I lived with them for a little under a year. Heather was on the shyer, more reserved side and not easy to talk to, but we got along well. I moved out just over a year ago about 20 miles away, and hadn’t seen her since, though we’re still friends on Facebook.

Recently, I joined a new gym, & my second time there I was surprised to see someone who instantly recognized as Heather behind the front desk! This was surprising as she lives 20 miles away; but I was absolutely certain it was her. I said, “Hey Heather! Good to see you again.” She gave me a really funny stare and told me she’s not Heather.

Her voice sounded just like Heather’s as well. She told me her name is Maddie, and it was clear she didn’t recognize me. I walked away feeling super embarrassed and puzzled. That girl looked, sounded and acted **so** identical to Heather in every way, shape and form; to a degree that is impossible to be a simple coincidence.

I pondered things in my mind, and on my way out approached Maddie. I asked her, “Sorry if this is too personal, but I’m wondering - are you adopted by any chance?” She responded that she is, but hasn’t made any effort to find her bio family. I told her that I strongly suspect that I know her identical twin sister, and explained things to her. 

I showed a picture of Heather on my phone to her, and to my surprise she didn’t act all that impressed, just giving me a simple, “Hmmmm. Okay.” I told her that I have Heather’s #, am friends with her on Facebook, have her address and would be happy to connect them, and she responded disinterestedly, “No thanks.”

I called Heather later & explained things to her, and **she too** seemed disinterested. I found Maddie’s profile on Facebook (by searching “people who work at \[name of my gym\]”) and texted Heather photos of her. But still, she acted disinterested. I’ve met Heather’s parents & they strongly resemble her, so what I suspect is that Heather’s mom had an extra baby (Maddie) that she gave up for adoption and never told her about.

I continued going to the gym, and almost every time I went Maddie would be there. Every time I saw Heather’s exact double, it would continue to bug me. I feel like I discovered something really amazing and groundbreaking, and it’s going unappreciated.

I added Maddie on Facebook and she accepted. Maybe she didn’t know it was me, since I have the mascot for a beloved baseball team of mine instead of a picture of myself as my profile picture. Having both girls as friends, I messaged both of them into a three-way Facebook chat, finally forcing them to interact with one another.

I was promptly blocked by both of them, and don’t know how things turned out. I’m now pretty nervous to go to the gym, and am considering looking for a new one. Was I the asshole to try and reunite these girls who I’m positive are twins?",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I (25F) asked my grandfather (75M) not to bring his new girlfriend (70sF) to my wedding? | My grandmother (GM) was one of my best friends my entire life. Unfortunately, she had a lot of serious health problems so I spent my entire life unsure if each time I saw her would be the last. As I started to get older and things were getting serious with my now fiance, I began to get hopeful that she would at least be able to make it to my wedding. But, she died 2 years ago.

8 months later, my grandfather (GP) had a new girlfriend (NGF). It was a bit of a shock to everyone because it was so soon, but we didn't want him to be miserable and alone so we were supportive. The only thing that me and my first cousin (17F), who was just as close as I was to our GM, asked was for him to not bring her to our family Christmas that year. It was the first Christmas we were going to have after our GM died, and we weren't ready to see someone else sitting at her seat at the dinner table. It also would have been the first time we met NGF. He got really upset and refused to come to Christmas. It became a big fight with various people in the family taking sides. My mother and aunt (my cousin's mom) wanted us to ""be the bigger people"" but we were just grieving the first person we'd both ever lost and we weren't ready yet.

There have been a bunch of other issues surrounding her in the last 1+ year causing family-wide fights. I don't have space to go through them all but I'll give one example. A few weeks ago, my GP started having stroke symptoms so they rushed to the hospital. Luckily it wasn't a stroke, it was Bells palsy from his new hearing aid. The problem was that they thought he was potentially dying and NGF didn't call any of his family. We didn't find out until my mother saw him next and asked what happened to his face.

So basically I've only met her once, and she has been the topic of numerous family-wide fights. I'm having a hard enough time knowing my GM won't be at my wedding. I think that seeing a strange woman in her seat, especially after all that's happened in the past 1+ year is going to be too painful. All this time I've told my GP I have no problem with him having a girlfriend and I have no major problem with the woman herself. I just wanted to not be rushed into acting like she's part of the family when I haven't even come to terms with the loss of the actual part of the family. It's taking longer than it should have because he's been really disrespectful and rushing us with this big change. I don't think it's been resolved enough at this point and I don't want that lingering heartbreak to spoil a day when I'm supposed to be happy and focusing on my new husband. But, my GP would be really upset, possibly to the point of refusing to come, and I know some other family members would be displeased with me for causing problems.

1,"AITA for accepting it when I ""got my way"" after crying? | Some light backstory: I'm a crier. I cry at *everything.* I'm not even usually all that upset when it happens, it's just a weird physical reaction that I go through at the slightest hint of negative emotion (my own or others). My boyfriend of the last year has been *incredibly* understanding and patient with me about this, and I'm working with a therapist to get a better handle on myself.

&#x200B;

Here's the issue: we recently went out to the other side of the country to visit my family, which was his first time really spending a good amount of time with them. They all get along great, which I couldn't be happier about! One of the days we were out there, though, I went through a small series of inconveniences (a small screw-up on a work email I had to deal with, our dogsitter accidentally locked herself out of our house so I had to call our neighbor to let her in, things like that) that soured my mood a little bit-- and then I found out my dad had gotten us dinner reservations for a seafood place that I'm sort of ambivalent to.

&#x200B;

This is where I potentially become the asshole. No one in my family makes a ton of money, so we don't go out to dinner very often; for that trip, it was reasonable to assume we'd only being going out the one time. Not only was I ambivalent to the chosen restaurant, but there's another restaurant in town that I really love and I'd hoped we'd be able to go to that one, and I guess on top of all the other tiny disappointments throughout the day it was just the one that pushed too far and I started crying. To be clear, I wasn't even that upset! Just a little disappointed. But I couldn't stop myself from crying. I really, really tried, it just happened.

&#x200B;

My dad asked what was wrong, and I told him honestly that I'd hoped we could have gone to the restaurant that I liked instead, and he offered to cancel the reservation for the seafood place and get a reservation for the other place the following night instead. I accepted, and was really grateful. It was a really nice thing for him to do, and I really appreciated it.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend was *mortified.* He said that the way I complained was whiny and childish, and he couldn't believe that after all the work I've put into not giving my tears the weight of genuine sadness that I'm not even feeling, that I would ""manipulate"" my dad by crying to get my way. I'm still kind of in shock that he saw it that way. I told him it wasn't like that, my family's used to how I cry over nothing, and he said that's even worse because that just means they know to drop everything and ""fix what's wrong"" with me so I stop. I don't know. I'm really shaken by this, am I really being manipulative? Should I have told him not to change the reservations even though I was really happy he did? I don't think anyone was heart-set on the seafood restaurant, but I guess I didn't get a chance to ask. So please, Reddit, I need some outside perspective. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for getting mad over my kids eating ""my treat""? | Like a lot of people we're in isolation so the kids - Becky (11) and Josh (8) are eating through everything in the house. The problem is that they never ask before they do, which would be fine if they knew how to make anything other than PB&J sandwiches or take whatever isn't nailed down.

My wife isn't working at the moment so I've been supporting the family as best as I can. We get by quite comfortably but obviously we've (I've) had to cut back on a few things. I don't spend much on myself but I do occasionally treat myself to stuff for baking at home, which I do every other day. I love making myself some oat tray bakes, but I'll also make some peanut butter bakes and chocolate brownies for the kids as that's their favourites.

Anyway, after a particularly long week I made some of these oat tray bakes for myself and was cooling them on the counter overnight. After doing some afternoon work for clients I went through to the kitchen to find about a fifth of the tray bake still in the tin. I went upstairs and, yep, there's a big plate of crumbs and two kids sitting on a bed playing video games. They had eaten through their treats yesterday so when I was making mine they had asked if I'd make them more of the things they like. I had told them no because of the previously mentioned 'taking without asking' which ruins their appetites for supper.

The kids had overstepped their boundary and eaten my treat because they were hungry but just wanted to take whatever they wanted. I was tired and overworked, and yes it's a bit pathetic but they were ""my"" tray bakes. I told them to get their butts downstairs and help me make more to replace the ones they stole.

My wife was on my side but my eldest kid told me that they were both hungry and they have a right to eat, I have no right to say what they can and can't eat because I'm not the real father to her and her brother. She got sent to her room and told she can come back down once she figures out what I'm angry about. Now my wife is mad at me because ""it's just food"" and I've no right to  send her daughter to her room. I told her (half joking but not really) that she can go to her room as well.

Right now my son and I are making tray bakes together and we've snuck a couple of triple chocolate muffins in there for him as his payment for helping, but I'm now starting to think that I've gone overboard because of some stupid snacks.

1,"AITA I broke my fake friend's computer screen and now everyone's pissed at me. Am I the Asshole? | Basically, we have computers supplied by our school. And they commonly break, crack, malfunction, etc. So basically, they're fragile. But there are not many consequences when breaking these computers. Either 50 or 75 dollars depending on the damage and that's it. So we were changing in the locker room and my friend places his computer bag with his computer inside on top of the lockers. (These lockers are about 4.5 ft high) and I... knock it off. I do this because it's pretty common to knock off someone's stuff that they put on top of the lockers in my friend group and we do it all the time. And even though I said the computers were fragile... I meant had a lot of flaws but they could take a beating. I had knocked off friend's computer from the top of the locker before so I knew that it was most likely okay. Well, he instantly gets pissed, exclaims that ""That was my computer"" in this super pissed tone and it kind of caught me off guard. I kept telling him it was fine and he rushes to open the computer and check. When he opens it he starts freaking out but that emotion slowly transitions into lashing out at me. He starts going off about how I broke his screen and that I was dumb, etc. It was this tiny screen crack at the bottom as if a small object like a rock or a marble had been directly thrown at that location, also a couple of hairline cracks came from the center too. Side note: I'm not saying he faked it to get me to pay to fix his computer (we'll get more into that in a bit) but I still have my suspicions. Anyways I basically tell him to piss off because obviously I would pay for it if it was my mistake. But I'll cut him some slack in the heart of the moment anyone would be mad. Flash forward a bit and people I know and don't know started coming up to me and saying things like ""Good luck paying 75 dollars!"" and ""How's \* friend name\*'s computer?"" Okay... tf. Apparently he went around telling everyone about it and talking mad crap and I don't know what he said to the people he talked to but everyone who came up to me made it sound like I butchered 7 children and served it to my family. The next day even some of my close friends start talking crap, saying that is was unfair he had to pay for it even though I had and have full intentions of paying for it. And it was no longer ""His computer cracked"" and somehow spiraled into ""His computer broke"" which made it seem worse then it was. It really showed how much of a fake friend he is. Outside of this story I always thought of this guy as a fake friend, he only acted like my friend because we shared a common friend. So this kind of behavior of screwing over my reputation isn't really surprising. So I just want to know... am I the asshole?",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I asked my wife how much she weighed? | So my wife and I recently moved and needed to get a scale for the new place, as we threw out the old one. I stepped on it first out of the box and it gave a higher number than expected. Turns out it needed to calibrate and then gave me a regular reading for my weight. I stepped away and my wife stepped on. 

Without much else happening, I came back in the room after stepping away for a second and all she said was “I need to lose a lot of weight.” And just kind of sat down on the couch. Now I have lost 60 lbs since the day we got married, and I am also had to earn various fitness certifications for my job.

1,"AITA for forcing my friend to buy me an uber to get home? | Ok so first of all, this is a throwaway account because whatever.

So my friend group hangs out a lot and in order to save gas/time/money, we end up carpooling a lot. Today my friend, Carly, wanted to take her younger sister, Annie, to see animals at a farm. This seemed like a spur of the moment thing since they called me to tell me to get ready about 10 minutes before they showed up at my apartment. My friend, Stan, was already in the front passenger seat and Carly was driving with her younger sister Annie in the backseat, so I got in the seat across from her.

&#x200B;

We end up at the farm, but we don't stay long due to the lack of animals and just things to do in general. Afterwards, we hang out some more at a park and we get food. Along the way, we end up picking up another friend, John, but we all decide to go home. Stan, John, and I all live relatively close so Carly was going to drop us off at home in the order of me, Stan, and John. 

&#x200B;

She pulls into my apartment complex and stops a few feet before my building. I ask her to pull up closer so I wouldn't have to walk as far and she would have to move up anyways in order to turn around and leave. She refuses. So I put my foot down and refuse to get out because she was being difficult. This stalemate lasts a few minutes before Carly decides to leave... with me still in the car. She ultimately decided that I ""had my chance"" and that she was going to drop off Stan and John then she was going to go home. She said that I could get out at one of their houses and find a way home from there. But due to unrelated reasons, I wouldn't be able to get home if I did, so I stayed in the car and watched them leave one by one until it's just me Carly and Annie left in the car.

Carly drives back to her house like she said she would, with me still in her backseat. She asks me how I plan to get home. I ask her to just drive me back home and offer her gas money. She says that she was serious when she told me that she was not going to drive back to my neighborhood. I remind her that every time that I have given her a ride, I have made sure that she actually makes it home safely. So she says that she'll order an uber for me, I offer to pay but she eventually decides that she doesn't want to accept it. 5 minutes later, the uber arrives and takes me home but since then, the whole situation has been running through my mind.

1,"AITA for being mad my roommate cleaned my side of the room? | Okay, so I’m (18F) in college and I have a dorm room which I share with my roommate (also 18F). We don’t really get along too much. It’s not that we dislike each other, it’s just kind of an awkward relationship because she’s really shy and quiet and only ever talks to her boyfriend. 

Each of us has a bed with pull-out storage drawers underneath, a desk, a dresser, and we share a closet and mini-fridge.

My roommate is a clean freak; I am not. Her desk and everything is always really organized, while my stuff is kinda all over the place. I had a bunch of clothes piled up on top of my dresser and some stuff on the floor also. Basically our sides of the room are like night and day.

She asked me last week (politely) if I could please try to keep my side of the room clean. I said sure, I’ll clean up in a few days because I had a huge exam I was studying for. She said okay. 

Then today, I got back to the dorm after class and guess what? She’d folded all my clothes and put them in the dresser. She’d even folded the clothes that were already in the dresser (that were previously haphazardly thrown in there). She stacked up my notebooks and textbooks that were scattered all over the place up in a neat pile on my desk.

0,"WIBTA for reporting my son to his PO for writing fraudulent check for $1600? | Here is some background. My son is 17. He lives with me and has almost no contact with his dad by his own choice. When he was 14, he got caught smoking a joint at school and was arrested. Shortly after being arrested, he was hospitalized twice for alcohol and drug overdose. Those incidents were never reported to the police. At his hearing for the joint at school, he was put on probation for 9 months.  

3 months after being placed on probation, he tested positive once again for drug use and was arrested again. At his probation hearing, his probation was extended for 18 months. 

Fast forward a few more months after a move and change in school in an attempt to get him away from those friends, he steals a phone at school and gets arrested again. No jail time, but probation got extended until his 18th birthday. 

A few months later, he tested positive for THC once again. His PO gave him an ultimatum, long term placement or inpatient drug rehab. He chose the rehab. Stayed there 4 months. 

3 months after drug rehab, he snuck out the window one night and was in a 17 mile police chase until they crashed the car and then he ran on foot from the police to my house. He was apprehended at home at 3 in the morning with guns pointed at me while I was cuffed on the cold ground as they searched my house. He was only detained one week in juvenile detention for this and is now awaiting his probation hearing to determine if he will go to long term placement for this last offense. 

That was 6 months ago. We are still waiting his trial. Since that offense, our relationship has improved dramatically and he has been clean on every drug test. He has stopped sneaking out and is doing well in school. 

Last month I opened a checking account for him because he is an aspiring music producer and has been getting paid for producing music for his friends. Last week, his bank card got “stolen”. I reported it stolen. But then a check for $1600 was deposited in his account. I went straight to the bank and stopped the check and reported the fraud. When I told my son that I was going to report the fraud to the police, he confessed that it was his friend and they were going to split the money. 

The thing is, he continues to find ways to break the law and doesn’t seem to learn from his mistakes. If I report him, his fate is sealed and he will go to placement until he is 18 and possibly have a new charge brought against him for fraud. If I don’t report it, what lesson am I teaching him?

1,"AITA for having a troubled student expelled 6 years ago? | So to set the stage I am a principal in a fairly.... corrupt part of Pennsylvania. If you’ve seen the documentary “kids for cash” than just know it’s somewhere around that area. So six years ago we had this student that I’ll call John. This boy was to be completely honest one of the most brilliant people I’ve ever met. I wholeheartedly believe if he had chosen a different path in life he would have been valedictorian. But John just loved doing bad shit. Smoking in the bathroom, showing up to school baked, calling teachers ungodly names, fist fighting, you name he probably did it. 

But honestly John wasn’t a bad kid. His family was judged extremely harshly, all of them felons, each parent in and out of jail. So he was treated like white trash by students and teachers alike. It’s understandable why he would act the way he would.

So it was half way through Johns tenth grade year when the superintendents son told John that he had been “fucking his crackwhore mom all night long”. John was 5’ 10” and 140 pounds soaking wet at 16 years old. Despite that I have genuinely never seen a worse beat down in my life. It took less than an hour for me to get a call from the super telling me to get rid of him.

I went along with it at the time not paying much thought to it. John was sent to the neighborhood reform school and from there to juvenile detention. Somewhere along the way he graduated high school early and joined the army. He’s still a very active part of the community while on leave and I actually introduced him to a school assembly where he spoke of how he turned his life around.

I noticed he was short with me before and after his speech but thought nothing of it, figuring he was a man of few words.

Yesterday I saw him eating lunch with an old teacher of his that I remember him being particularly close to. I went up to them asking if I could join and then John pulled me aside.

He gave me a speech about how I was a key piece in what was ultimately some pretty messed up experiences in his life. I don’t remember too much of it except the words “The way you guys did me may have been standard, but it wasn’t right. So sincerely Jake (my first name which I thought was incredibly rude), go fuck yourself”.

I’m torn on whether what I did really was the tough love he needed or if he really could have been so much more if I had been there to stand up for him. So reddit AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for faking a death in the family to avoid paying a cancellation fee? | My wife and I are looking to sell our house, a few weeks back she made a booking for an assessor to come through and inspect the property. She asked me to make sure I could take the day off work so I would be there to let them in. I am a shift worker and don't do Mon-Fr 9 to 5 so it is no real inconvenience for me to arrange to be home on any given day, the trouble is life just got in the way, I was busy and I forgot until the day before when I got a reminder email notifying me what time they would arrive.

By this time it was too late to adjust my roster so i called the company thinking I could reschedule. The rep told me that cancelling within 2 days of the inspection usually incurs a 50% fee unless it is due to extenuating circumstances. Off the top of my head I lied and said my father in law had passed away that morning in a car accident and I was very sorry for inconveniencing them but it just isn't possible for me to deal with something like a property evaluation right at this moment. The company rep was incredibly apologetic and expressed her sympathy, and waived the cancellation fee. I said I'd call back to reschedule in the new year after the dust had settled and the grief was less raw.

Well what do you know my wife checks the mail and received a card from the real estate company personally addressed to her and expressing their sympathy for our loss (it's a relatively small local business). She asked me if I knew what it was about, I told her what had happened and she went apeshit at me. She said it was my fault for not fixing my schedule like she asked (true) and that I shouldnt have lied like that. I said I feel bad that the employee took it to heart like that but that I had saved us $150 in cancellation fees so I did what had to be done. I said I'd reschedule an appraisal with a different company, she said it's not just about that but now she feels she can't trust me anymore. 

I know I am the asshole for forgetting about the appointment in the first place but I feel like I made the right choice to minimise any financial loss that would flow from my bad decision. My wife obviously disagrees so now I am second guessing myself. Am I also the asshole for lying to avoid having to pay the cancellation fee?",False,False
1,WIBTA if I raised rent almost 100% | I'm interested in investing in real estate and I've came upon a property that looks decently priced but it is currently occupied by tenants paying 800/mo.

1,"WIBTA If I stepped down from my friend's wedding 2 days prior? | A good friend of mine got engaged last July and asked me to be her maid of honor. I've had my reservations about the whole thing from the start seeing as they had only been dating for a month when he proposed. And there seem to be a lot of red flags with the guy. I tried to be supportive and help her plan it last summer (because weddings take a lot of fucking planning) but one thing or another got in the way. She's super scattered and flakey anyway so we just never made any solid plans. They didn't set a date until mid January. I happened to start a new job in January so I have 0 free time for anything now, especially when she lives an hour away and was my baby sitter (but stopped babysitting to plan her wedding) so now I also don't have a babysitter.

So now we're a couple days out from the wedding, there is no real plan, she barely answers my texts to try and figure out what's going on. There isn't even a rehearsal. And she keeps making plans without saying anything to me and then getting irritated when I can't participate because I wasn't given notice. I couldn't attend her bachelorette party because I had to work, told them all that day wouldn't work for me, but it's my fault apparently. 

I'm so over this whole thing. I really don't want to go. I don't want to be a part of it. It's exhausting and stressful and has sent my anxiety through the roof. So would I be the asshole if I told her I didn't want to be part of her wedding 2 days prior?

1,"AITA for pinching a ladies arm fat at the dinner table? | So before I even get into it, I wanna preface this by saying I have always considered myself TA in this situation. However, I recently remembered this event and thought I’d get a second opinion. 

Also sorry for formatting, and English isn’t my first language. 

This happened about 3 years ago so I was 16F at the time. My mom had been friends with our neighbor Ann for a couple of years, and since she lived a couple houses down she would visit frequently. Before this event I had a couple encounters with Ann, and she always made me uncomfortable because she was constantly talking about weight loss and dieting. 

Now there is nothing wrong with wanting to lose weight. However, Ann would always be talking about 30 day cleanses where she would do nothing but drink water with lemon and Kayan pepper. Essentially starving herself. When she wasn’t on her cleanse she was mostly eating unhealthy foods so her weight would constantly fluctuate. She would swear by this method, and would also brag about how she had been doing this for 15+ years. 

She was also always trying to convince my mom and I to try this ‘diet’. I particularly remember one time when I was 14 she took me out to dinner, and told me that I should attempt this diet(because like most girls at that age I was self conscious of my body and wanted to lose weight). She described it to me in great detail, and bragged about how she had been skinnier than most girls(with the implication that she was skinner than me at my age) while she was in school. 

This actually led to me trying to restrict what I was eating, but I’ve always loved food so I wasn’t super successful(luckily). Fast forward 2 years, I had started working out and actually improving my body in a healthy way. So one evening my mom invites her over for dinner, and once again she’s going on and on about her cleanse. So I told her that her method was extremely unhealthy, and would mostly lead to loss of muscle and water weight. I explained that eating healthier and working out would be a lot more beneficial in the long run. 

She started getting pretty angry at what I was saying, and began to argue that she was healthy and her diet has worked her whole life. This is the part where I’m most likely TA. I started getting pretty worked up, and in the heat of the moment I reached over and squeezed her arm fat between my fingers. This was a gentle squeeze, but it pretty much highlighted the point I was making about loss of muscle. She got extremely upset, and I ended up leaving dinner early. 

I know I’m probably TA in this situation, and I’ve always felt bad about how I handled things. I would never do something like this now, but I thought I’d put this out there and get some outside opinions.",False,False
1,"AITA for refusing to split the cost of a flight with my boyfriend? | I'm on a throwaway so I'm going to change up the details a slight bit.

My boyfriend (23M) and I (23F) are both from LA. We met there and have been dating for just over half a year now. I moved to Toronto, across the continent in Canada, for school just a short while ago.

My boyfriend has this idea that him visiting me is almost like a favour to me. He says that we should split the cost of flights 50/50 when we fly across the continent to see each other, but so far the only thing planned is him coming to see me twice this month.

I am a broke graduate student and he is significantly more well-off than I am. I have expressed before that I was feeling lonely, but I never specifically requested that he come to see me.

Today we had an argument because I said that I didn't want to pay for half his flights (800 USD, half = 400). He told me that was not fair because he was spending ""so much time in transit"" flying across the country (5-10 hours one way, depends how you fly) and that ""the person being visited should front the majority of the costs"". He also labelled me greedy. When I told him that if he cared about me, he would just pay for his flights in full, he called me manipulative.

It's a huge amount of money for me and I don't feel comfortable with this arrangement. I asked a friend and my dad today and they both said this was not a good way to deal with expenses. Am I the asshole for refusing to split the cost of flights with my boyfriend coming to visit me?",False,False
0,"AITA for taking away study notes from my partner who refused to help me write them? |  At the beginning of the year, my boyfriend and I began the same college courses. All of them were new to me, but he was retaking a few of them after dropping out about half-way through last semester.

I began to write digital study notes on all of our lectures, and we both agreed to write them together and use them as a shared resource. We tried to see if this was a viable method we could be expected to keep up with, but unfortunately he couldn't handle the workload. Beyond that point, they became my personal notes that only I was writing. However, I didn't change the sharing permissions- so he could still access all of my notes at any time.

Soon, all this recent stuff hit and our studying was converted to exclusively online. All of our tests and exams are now online and open-book, making my notes now especially useful- all we have to do is ctrl + f keywords to find the answers, barely any studying needed!

Now when this happened, my partner very much struggled with the transition to online learning. I soon became the only one that was actually watching the online lectures, keeping track of the work that was due, and reminding him of deadlines. When it comes to tests for courses he hasn't done before, he relies entirely on my lecture notes to answer all the questions.

Now, here's where the problem starts. I find the note-writing I do to be quite a large workload, and it imposes quite a bit of stress on me. Recently I've been struggling to complete them in time for the tests coming up in a few days, so I asked my partner if he could help me out by writing notes for a single course lecture.

His response was no, he wouldn't, because he didn't need my notes for that one course. When I told him that I write notes that he does need for other courses, and I'd appreciate some help and recognition for all the work I've been doing to help him out, he still refused. He expressed that he felt scared he wouldn't do them the right way, and I said I didn't care how they were formatted. Still, he refused.

Now I felt really betrayed and used because of this. He has none of his own work he's been doing- he's with me all day, and all he does is play video games and barely get out of bed. He hasn't even said a single thanks once for all the work I've been doing to keep his grades afloat. He really seems to resent me at all suggesting that he's even slightly reliant upon me.

So I've finally decided to remove his access to my digital notes, leaving him completely stranded. He hasn't found out yet, and I suspect that he only will once he attempts the test in a few days. I feel a bit of guilt about it, and I don't know whether completely depriving him of that resource will cause him to fail. I also know that he suffers a lot with various illnesses like depression, and maybe he's been struggling with the workload because of it. AITA?",False,False

1,"AITA for ceasing to feed the homeless man outside of my apartment because he wants me to cut the meat up for him? | In the last 2 places I've lived, I've chosen one nearby homeless guy to help out. When I used to smoke, I'd shed a cigarette for instance, & even give them a hunk of a roast I'd make, or even a whole chicken breast half, with trail mix & fruit too. I'd even ask them what kind of sauces they prefer..

I'm extremely financially down right now, & have been for a little while. I am feeling like he is taking my kindness for weakness though. He is missing teeth, but I've seen him eating fried chicken etc no problem. I've watched him pull a 12+ inch knife out of his bag & cut the food in front of me while we visited & he gave me some honest feedback on my recipe/texture, as I requested.

Recently he asked me if I could cut the whole thing up into little pieces for him. Given he has plastic ware & the knife, it's resonating with me that he's pushing the envelope. He wants a healthy hot meal set down right on his bench so he can avoid getting up & walking around the bench to his bags & getting his utensils out & just wants to eat it with his fingers.

He's not exactly starving either, in fact most of the time I see him, he has a huge soda & some tasty restaurant food that someone else bought him. I've also seen him scooping out canned tuna with some chips or whatever.

Idk, I've heard many similar stories throughout my life. Complaints about the kind of bread bought, etc.

I was kind of outraged that they sent a letter out almost shaming those that didn't contribute to the church. To me the letter read that he was disappointed in those that gave nothing financially to the church. That just doesn't sit well in my book and the more I stewed on it the more frustrated I got. I ended up calling and essentially saying that those that contributed nothing or little should not be shamed with a number game sent in the mail. If anything you should be sending a letter to those that contributed nothing letting them know that the church has resources available and that they will always be welcomed to contribute spiritually. He sounded shocked and said finances are a huge part of the church. I kind of went off at that point and said I would be switching memberships.

0,"AITA, for not wanting to listen to my boyfriends music? (He makes the music.) | Boyfriend is a musician. Use to be in a successful local band but hasn't played out anywhere since well before we started dating. Our relationship is fine but his music has been really getting on my nerves. For one it's not my type and I don't think it's that good although I would never say that to his face. But the main reason it bothers me is because he's too in your face about it. When we're in the car he's constantly putting on Cd's he recorded of himself or playing tracks of himself from his phone.

0,"AITA for quitting my job on ""short notice"" and leaving the company understaffed? | I recently got a dream job oppurtunity that would require me to move across country. I'm supposed to start late March and earlier this month as soon I got the offer I let my boss know when I needed my last day to be and said that I could even try to negotiate with my new job to start a week or two later to help while she finds my replacement. 

My boss is acting like I'm trying to screw her over by taking this job and now I feel guilty. I work in a small library with under 10 employees, only two of us (outside of management) being full time. The other full-timer recently put in her notice to start a new job as well. Between the two of us we do a bulk of the work there.

As soon as I gave my notice she asked why I didn't say that I was looking for another job and that all this is very last minute and puts not only her but my coworkers in a bad position because I handle a lot of the day to day important tasks like opening and the money. She made me feel like I was being very inconsiderate. 

I told her that I was sorry and it wasn't intentional just bad timing. That I realized it would be hard for her to cover my hours as well as my other coworkers which is why I was giving her a months notice instead of 2 weeks and that I would even try to stay  a week or so past that if possible.  And that I'd be more than happy to help with training anyone new.

Ever since that convo she's made a big deal about announcing I'm leaving and that everyone will have to pull together to cover my shifts. She said she may not be able to approve vacation requests and now I'm sure my coworkers are resentful of me as well. She talks loudly in her office to managers at other branches about how she's going to be understaffed and it's basically my fault and how stressed out she is. I feel like all this is very passive aggressive but I'm wondering did I do anything wrong?

I'm really excited for this oppurtunity for multiple reasons and I feel like it would give me a chance to start over but I feel guilty now for leaving in a way that puts the company in a bad position.

1,"AITA for being flakey? | So, I feel like an AH, so I need some help getting some perspective. Also, on mobile. 

I have a fairly close friend that I wish I could see more. We've gone through it. We worked at a minimum wage job together and graduated high school together. We're very different people now (she's married with a baby on the way, and I've been focused on my career), but when we get together it's great. 

Here's the AITA. When we graduated high school, I moved 4 hours away. Last week I moved 9 hours away from my home town and where she still lives. My parents never taught me how to drive, and it's never been necessary until recently to learn, so I always went back to hometown via a long (expensive) train ride. I now no longer see my parents, so going back would only be to see her. 

Now, dont get me wrong, I really do want to see my friend, but spending $300 for a weekend visit is a lot for me to swallow. I can afford it if I scrimped and saved every penny, but it would be very difficult. I'm also an introvert, so the idea of being a guest in someone's house for 3 days with no alone time makes me anxious. 

Because of this, I have cancelled more than a few times on plans (she has too, but less than I have), and I'm seriously considering not going to her baby shower because of the cost (I just moved and am sleeping on the floor because I cant afford a bed yet -.-) and the 9 hour trip.

0,"AITA? I went to pick up a date but I drove off after seeing sketchy individuals. | So, I met a girl on a dating app this past weekend. Since the start of our conversations, something felt a bit... Off.

First, her profile stated that she was 26, but she said that she couldn't be out too late because of a curfew. I blew it off as maybe she lives with her overprotective parents. I planned on asking more about it on the date. 

Next, she wanted to meet up on Easter. I don't personally celebrate, but I know that most places are closed and families usually have plans. There would be almost nothing to do. 

Finally, before we decided to meet, our conversation within the app disappeared, meaning that she blocked me or temporarily deleted the app. Today, the conversation reappeared and she apologized very purfusely and asked to meet up today. She said she was ready *at that very moment*. 

At this point in sketched out as hell, but I also have a tendency to overthink things so I decided to meet up after I finished my errands.

I went to pick her up from her house and when I pulled up there was a white car with two guys in the front seat. It was about 60 degrees F and they both had on coats with their hoods pulled up, looking down and obviously avoiding eye contact and making sure to cover their faces. 

When she came up to the car I locked the doors and rolled down the window. I asked her who the guys were and she said ""They're my friends, they are just smoking."" I looked back at the car and one guy looked up and back down quickly, then closed the driver's side door, which was previously open. There was no smoke coming from the car, not a cigarette or any weed in sight. I told her it was too sketchy and I left.

0,"AITA for not speaking to my sister for 3 years? | My [30F] sister [37F] and I have never gotten along. She always bullied me growing up and is just a horrible person in my opinion. She won’t stay in therapy long enough for an “official” diagnosis but we’re 99% sure she has BPD/Narcissism based on what her childhood therapists would say and how she behaves.

I could go on and on with examples but I’m limited by the subs word count. Just trust me on this one.

She now has 3 kids that my family supports 100% while she pretends to work jobs and just sits and home and does drugs (in a home my parents bought for her).

Now this may seem irrelevant but it’s important. When I was in college I got pregnant and decided to abort. Not going to give any reasoning for the choice because it’s not relevant for context.

Now to the part where I might be the asshole. 

3 years ago I got engaged to my now husband. My mom wanted to throw a bridal shower and included my sister as the host. My sister was then suddenly engaged to her new bf. Spoiler alert, they broke up. The day before my bridal shower she has a meltdown. Screaming, throwing things, etc. I give her food and tell her I love her, trying to be the bigger person. Later she texts me that she’s sorry and says thanks. Cool. Whatever.

The next day, she’s is nowhere to be seen for my shower. She is, however, on Facebook posting about what a great mother she is and how her family never supports her. She doesn’t answer anyone’s calls or texts. 

The next day is Mother’s Day. We were all supposed to meet at a relatives for a family gathering. She’s an hour late and ignores me.

We all get our food and sit down at a table for our immediate family (there were about 5 tables total). I was raging and said “we missed you at the bridal shower yesterday.” She says “you KNOW why I wasn’t there.” I honestly had no clue and still don’t. But I said “because you’re a bitch?” My mother snaps at us to stop so we do. 

My niece turns to me and says “I almost wished you a happy Mother’s Day but I forgot you don’t have any kids but you have dogs does that count?” I said I guess I’m a dog-mom so she jokingly wished me a Happy Dog-Mother’s Day. My sister then says “she’s a mother to the dead child she aborted.”

I saw red and almost blacked out in rage. 

I just walked out of the house. A few minutes later my mom and niece picked me up on the side of the road and drove me home. I haven’t spoken to my sister since I called her a bitch. My family has begged me for years to forgive her.

I’ve been thinking about it and maybe I shouldn’t have started it at our relatives house. I called her a bitch in front of her kids and I feel really bad. She’s got mental issues and she can’t help the fact that she’s like that. I think she’s incapable of empathy but I’m not, so maybe ITA. I should’ve known it wouldn’t have ended well.

I immediately apologized and said I didn't know how that she felt so strongly about it. She told me she didn't even know what to say, and that no one had ever asked her that question before. It soured the whole evening and probably ruined any chances of a third date.

I really didn't think it was that big a deal, I get that it's courtship, but I figured since she had told me earlier about not liking people who are spoiled/sensitive and the wealth disparity... I just didn't think much of it at the time.

My ex and I split exactly 1 month ago after dating for about a year and a half.

Obviously he did a lot better than I did, went to uni and did well there and now works in finance. I work in childcare and he out-earns me hugely. I love my job and wouldn't give it up for the world but am aware of the difference. Sam has studied and worked with people from much better backgrounds than me but has never treated me any different even with the salary differences. 

Since he's worked for his current company he's made a friendship with one of his colleagues. Her name is Amy, and I'll admit that she's way prettier than me. I've met her several times and to be honest I don't like her. I didn't have a problem with her to begin with, but when we first met we were chatting about clothes and things, and she asked me where I shop. When I told her *average budget clothes shop* she couldn't stop herself laughing. Also, Sam brought me to one of his work parties as his date. Stupidly I spilled my drink on my dress, and Amy was laughing her head off. 

Whenever the three of us meet she relentlessly cuts me off to carry on her own conversations with him, even when he brings it back to me she cuts me off again. I know for a fact she doesn't like me. 

Also, what I said earlier about how he's never brought up the career/educational differences between us, he's started to since they've become friends. We've argued about certain things, and he's said that I can't possibly understand because I'm not as educated as himself, he's said his job is *much more* stressful than mine when he's always been very understanding of the stresses I go through. He's gone from acting as me equal to openly wishing I was on the same ''professional level'' as him. 

I know for a fact that this is all that snob Amy's influence. The way she's acted towards me before. I'm 100% sure she's putting the idea that he needs to be with someone ''on his level'' into his head. This coupled with the fact she's asked him to come hang out with her at her parents house makes me very worried about what she wants with him.

Sam thinks I'm making something out of nothing, insists they're nothing more than friends. I don't suspect him of anything but I know what she wants, but he thinks I'm wrong to think that of her.",False,False
1,"AITA for not letting my kids go on vacation with my ex because it's my time with them. | So right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because I won't give up my appointed time with them. My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. 

&#x200B;

A little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. 

&#x200B;

Well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to ""think of them"". I told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.

&#x200B;

Well, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to Disneyland"". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.

&#x200B;

I'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being ""can't tell them the truth cause they already know it"".

0,"WIBTA If I don't contribute towards my work colleagues buying a micro pig for another colleague's birthday? | Tldr: my colleagues bought me fish which I wasn't expecting in the past for my birthday. Another colleague's birthday is coming up and they want to buy them a pig and I don't really agree. WIBTA if I don't contribute? 

I really wish this was a joke but let me explain. This colleague of mine is about to turn 40. We will call them George if that's okay. Nothing against her she is a great person. Now George still lives at home with their parents and owns a dog. They are going through the phase of desperately dating around, and they have always wanted a micro pig.

My colleagues love to celebrate birthdays. They bought me fish, bless them, for my 20th birthday because I was very lonely at the time as I had just moved out from my parents house etc. I really appreciated the thought and I love my fish dearly, but sometimes I feel a little bit tied down by them, as I'm not always at home (I spend a lot of time around my boyfriend 's house) and one day I eventually want to move away and that may be an issue with fish as if be looking to go to another house share. Don't get me wrong I really really appreciated the thought, but I don't think they took into consideration the commitment it takes to look after an animal. They did mean we'll though. 

Although I expressed slight interest in what I would hypothetically name an axolotl before my birthday, I never ever expected to see fish when I walked into my room. I am currently in a house share with a colleague, as it was the only viable option at the time. 

Back to George, my concern is they still live at home and it really isn't fair on their parents to bring a surprise pig into the house. I'm also concerned about how the pig will interact with the dog.

If course I want to celebrate their birthday, but I just simply don't agree with buying someone a micro pig without taking into consideration the commitments that go into looking after them. Besides little guppies are very different to a micro pig.

So will I be the asshole if I just buy my own gift for them?",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my daughter she has to cook her own meals? | 
My daughter is 16 and recently has watched several documentaries, read a few books, medical journals and has come to the conclusion that she wants to become a vegetarian. My husband and I support this, however the rest of us are not vegetarians. We don’t make carnivorous meals every night, but I would say at least 5 out of 7 days a week. I always have what would be a vegetarian side dish, but I am also not a short order cook. I said she can come grocery shopping with me, I’ll buy the food, cook books, etc, and on nights we’re eating meat, she can cook her own food. 

This upset my daughter. She says her siblings don’t have to cook their own dinner, why should she? I said because they’re eating what I’m making in the first place. She said that this was “favoritism” but agreed. My husband thinks I should cook for her, but he doesn’t cook the meals in this house, I do.

1,"AITA for throwing out my roommates non-vegan food? | When my girlfriend and I put out advertisements for a roommate we specified that we keep a strict vegan house - no exceptions. This meant no meat in the house, no dairy, no eggs, not even honey. We were very clear on this and outright said another vegan would be ideal. And that actually worked out pretty smoothly! A girl we'll call Jessica moved in and things went along swimmingly for the past three years. Jessica was also an ethical vegan and there was no fuss over food, no drama, everything was peaceful and we all were pleased with the arrangement.

Enter Jessica's new boyfriend, Charlie. Charlie absolutely does NOT agree with veganism. Ever since an incident where he drunkenly tried to store a bunch of half eaten sausages in our fridge and I told him he wasn't keeping that shit in our house, he's had a big problem with me. Whenever he comes over he'll make snide little comments about our little vegan decontamination zone, and loudly talk about how much he loves meat and all the the meat he recently ate. To sum up how childish he is, he went as far as to ask if he was allowed to take a non-vegan shit in our toilet in front of a bunch my guests my girlfriend and I were hosting which was completely embarrassing for everyone. He's a complete dickhead, but that isn't what the main issue is.

I figured Jessica wouldn't put up with Charlie for long given how he behaves, but not only has that not happened, he's talked her out of veganism entirely. When Jessica let me know that she was no longer vegan, I told her as long as she didn't store it in the house, it was fine. Seeing her bring meat takeout into our house to eat was upsetting, I won't lie, especially given Charlie would often be grinning like a rat during the entire ordeal. Not to mention the smell.

Emboldened by Charlie, she's started to store non-vegan food in our fridge. First it was butter and some liquid egg whites, which my girlfriend begged me not to start something over given how tense things had gotten, but earlier today I came home and found multiple packets of bacon taking up nearly an entire shelf of the fridge. I gathered them up in a trash bag alongside the butter and other stuff that had built up and just tossed it all in the bin outside. When Jessica returned and saw it was all gone a shouting match broke out and now she's claiming I can't force her to keep a vegan fridge, and our agreement meant nothing at all. I told her perhaps it was better she find another house to rent at, and she called me a controlling dick.

I don't think I'm being controlling **GIVEN THIS AGREEMENT WAS CLEARLY SPECIFIED**. It wasn't a hidden clause, it wasn't something I sprung on her. In my opinion Jessica and Charlie are both behaving like absolute fucknuggets, but when I vented to my brother he said that I was actually being a dick in this situation.

My partner has expressed multiple times that she’s sad that she missed out on a traditional proposal and wedding, so I decided to propose with a real ring and then we can plan a real wedding. I told my parents about this and they said it was tacky and looked like a gift grab since we’ve technically been married for 2 years. I’m just trying to give my partner something she always wanted.

1,"WIBTA for stopping my daughters allowance and kicking her out of my house | Throwaway for obvious reasons, my wife and I have had 4 kids. 3 of them are angels, a 3 year old daughter, a 6 year old son and a 10 year old son. They're kids, but they behave with the upmost respect and are a pleasure to come home to each and every day after work. Our oldest daughter (19), is quite the opposite. I regret raising her in the same household as my other children.

She is a heavy substance abuser, very alcoholic and just a horrible person in general. It honestly sucks because we tried our absolute best raising her as a child, not spoiling her but teaching her the value of everything, sending her to a good school and letting her have the best education, whilst also living in a good area with access to many sporting and entertainment facilities such as a cinema and a large shopping mall. She used to be a good child, but all changed when she began attending high school. 

Her grades used to be very good, she had many friends and many people loved her. My wife and I try to love her, but she is troubled, doesn't work and depends on us to get her through every single day. She dropped out of high school. She is very distant to our other children, they tend to ignore her whenever she is home. She always asks for more and more money, and her ""needs"" keep expanding. We've tried sending her to rehabilitation for her substance issues and have been to many counselors but no amount of trying has changed a thing about her behavior.

We gave her a monthly allowance, but she blows through it incredibly quickly on unnecessary things that fuel her addiction. She doesn't have a job, doesn't agree to go look for one either, even when we've arranged interviews for her. She is always very grumpy, grouches, and also always brings many, many guys home to presumably sleep with them, whether or not the rest of the family is home. 

It is so difficult to talk to her, we ran out of the options we could think of. My wife and I got fed up of this behavior, and told her to either find a job or actively seek help for her addiction. We gave her 2 weeks, which was generous, to get her life sorted. Of course, she didn't do anything but stay home or go out and get high and wasted. We immediately decided after that to kick her out, stopping her monthly allowance, and taping a note to her bags with her clothes and basic necessities, giving her enough money to spend a couple nights at a nearby motel and really think about her situation.

1,"AITA for yelling at my mom after she ruined my jeans | So my mom does laundry on saturdays and she likes to combine her clothes with my sister's and mine. It's okay if you want to wash jeans or sweaters but she also combines our socks and pantys because ""it's a waste of water to wash only five pantys"" lol and I really hate that. I've confronted her about it and it got to a point were I had to do my laundry on a weekday in secret. Accidentally I mix a jean with a red t-shirt and it got dyed. It has happened before so I figure I would wash it again next wednesday and it would be fine. (this part is important because I've been gaining weight due to anxiety and I've always had body issues problems. This jeans make me feel good or at least not bad looking)

That saturday my mom took ALL the clothes and she put clorox on my jean and guess what. There are big white stains on my favourite jean. When I asked about it she said that she thought the redness would come off and didn't expect that result and that she would buy me new ones. I knew she felt guilty about it but it's not the first time she has ruined some jeans doing the exact same so I just can't fully understand how she thought it wouldn't happen again. I started crying and she asked why if they were only jeans so I told her that it was the only jean that fitted me (with red eyes and a bit of despise in mi voice) and she looked heartbroken.

I think have all the right to get mad at her. I know that she tried to help or at least wouldn't do it on purpose but now I feel bad that I've made her heart broke. Like I would talk to her but I know that if I tell her that I'm responsible for my own laundry she would say it's a waste of water and money, that I don't have the time (which is partially truth but I've managed to do it for a month). If I tell her not to do it anymore she would feel useless (we've talked about it before when I started cooking and didn't want any help) and I don't want to make her feel that way is just that I don't want her ruining my clothes anymore. She also isn't the type to say she's sorry. Like you know she is but she wouldn't tell you straight forward so I guess waiting for her to initiate the conversation would not happen.

0,"AITA for calling my sister out for being a bad mother | so, i’m currently 18 and have an older sister who’s 4 years older than me. around the time i started transitioning into high school, she had found out that she was pregnant. with her boyfriend not being in the picture at the time, i was left as one of the primary people to take care of her child. of course, i was ecstatic, and had enthusiastically helped babysit my niece whenever needed. this usually ate up most of my time, and by the time she got a job, i was watching my niece more than 40 hours a week with no pay.

me having to watch her for the majority of my week got into the way of my academics, and it was really difficult to try to get a job myself or keep up with any extracurriculars. this continued throughout the entirety of my high school career, with me only starting to get paid around $1 an hour for the labor i did throughout the week.

this wouldn’t necessarily be an issue in itself if i was treated okay, especially since i know how expensive child care is. the issue is that she’s grown to feel entitled to my help. she often doesn’t take care of my nieces basic necessities, and will routinely “forget” to feed or bathe her. because of this, i have to constantly step in as a parent and take care of my nieces needs, along with doing recreational activities (painting, playing music, reading) with her.

fast forward to now, i’m about to be a sophomore in college and just got my first job. i was excited initially at the thought of this, but soon became really concerned for my nieces well being. my nieces father is slowly coming back into the picture, which made me more hopeful for her quality of care. unfortunately, my sister instead spends most of her time hanging out with him, not paying too much attention to my niece. even now, it isn’t rare for her not to feed or bathe my niece, and her “forgetting” to feed her breakfast this morning was my last straw. 

i angrily confronted her, claiming that she needs to own up to her responsibilities and become a better parent. this led her to jump on me and attack me, claiming that “i don’t have the right to talk to her like that”. my mom and her boyfriend separated us, and now my face is scratched up and we’re not on good terms. my mom says that way i approached it wasn’t okay, and that i should’ve went about it in a different way. i completely disagree due to my frustration, but i really do want to know if i actually was in the wrong.",False,False

1,"AITA for telling my friend ""You know what, go the fuck home""? | My friend, we'll call him ""A"", is someone I love to death. We've known each other since 2nd grade and only really started hanging out together in high school. A few years ago, I was hospitalized for Schizophrenia and he was one of the people that I personally knew (so not friends of my parents, family, spouses of family) that visited me. I always make a point of it that I can never thank him enough for being there for me, and being with my family, in the best way he could.  He's a type of person that feels really guilty about a lot of stuff in his life, to a level of irrationality, and he drinks every day to numb the pain. He smokes weed now and then, and does cocaine (with me !) every once in a blue. Believe it or not this whole ""get so high you forget the pain"" thing kinda made use grow closer.

Fast forward to more recent times.

This guy drinks and drives. All the time. One time he got so drunk he went to the base of a bridge and ran out of gas, not knowing how he got there (I went and helped him). He already has a DWI and he's lost the trust of his parents (they dont know about the DWI;  probably kick him out for that) because of being drunk. His parents, and him funnily enough, aren't super strict Muslims, but they follow the holy book, pray, etc.  Whenever we hang out, either I pick him up or he comes to my house and I drive from there. Every time I ask him to drive, his excuse is ALWAYS ""Yo, I'm drunk, I can't drive"". I counter with ""you be driving drunk to (insert neighborhood) to do (something I'm not gonna say on the internet) and all of a sudden you can't drive."" Then he replies, you really gonna make me drive, I'm drunk bro, what if we get pulled over.... you know what, if you don't drive, I'm going home."" And that's interesting to me because I'm thinking why not stay by me for a bit, sober up, and THEN drive home? You're gonna immediately go home, fully drunk, after going so hard over not drinking and driving ?

Fast forward to today.

He pulls up to my house, gets out and says I'm not driving with a big ass smile on his face. I'm like ok, why ? He says he's drunk. I bring up the thing about him drinking and driving all the time. He gets angry and says you know what, if you're not driving, I'm going home. At that point I've had enough of that line, essentially holding me by the fucking balls every time he says it, and told him you wanna go home, go the fuck home.

10 minutes later I get a text from him saying I'm the only person that forces him to drive drunk and that DWI's are serious.

1,"AITA for calling my wife’s friend a snob? | Me/wife (Wendy): 30s m/f

Friend (Francie): 30s f

Wendy and Francie have been friends since they were in college, so about half their lives.  Wendy has multiple serious illnesses and can’t work or drive, while I work in a low paying job and go to school to be an English teacher (this is relevant I swear).  Francie has a very well paying job, for anonymity’s sake I’ll say she’s a lawyer.  

Until about six months ago, we lived a plane flight away, with Francie living in Denver and us living in Chicago (again, not where we really live but the distance is similar).  Francie would come visit us a few times a year, We all really enjoyed these visits and had a great time catching up and hanging out.  About six months ago, her “law firm” got into a lot of trouble; and Francie was looking for a different job.  She found what has to be the ultimate dream job for a “lawyer” in downtown Chicago.  Wendy and I, but especially Wendy, were very excited.  Because she doesn’t drive and can’t work, she doesn’t have much of a social life around here so we were thrilled that she’d get her best friend moving back.  

The trouble started almost immediately.  We offered to help her move, but she said her new law firm paid for her movers. We made plans to go see her the first week she was here, but when we showed up, she seemed very unenthusiastic and just didn't want to hang out with us.  Wendy messaged her that night just asking if things were ok, and got this response:
""Hey it was great seeing you too.  Sorry if I was upset.  This whole thing has really been pretty traumatic for me, and I think I just want to lick my wounds in peace for a while.  Definitely appreciate you and [my name] reaching out ❤️ can I ping you this weekend?""

I work with teenagers who have survived the worst if the worst in my student teaching, homelessness, foster care, abuse, etc. And Wendy has had major medical issues.  So I thought calling getting a dream job a ""trauma"" was just ridiculous, but I didn't say anything.  Wendy was immediately worried, and texted back saying, ""if you're traumatized, you shouldn't be alone.  I'll come and hang out with you."" To which Francie responded, ""Please don't."" 

We were pretty shocked, but didn't say anything.  Since then, Francie has seen Wendy max once a week.  Several times, Francie has been too drunk to drive Wendy back to our house and has had to call an Uber for Wendy.  Meanwhile, Francie has done a lot of ""social"" things, like join fancy gyms and woman's clubs, and dating.  

We had a group zoom call this weekend, but Francie had to cut it short to do a zoom with her weird woman's club.  I wasn't happy, and sent her a text telling her to quit ignoring her best friend and basically said she's a snob.

Francie sent multiple texts to me and Wendy, saying that I'm.the AH.  At first I thought I wasn't, but my mom said I needed to calm.down before texting and the way I worded my reaction was wrong, and Wendy agrees.

1,"AITA for telling this girl losing a dog is not the same as losing a child? | This happened about a week ago and I'm currently dealing with the repercussions of it. 

I work in an office environment. Came into work one morning and as I passed our break room, I saw through the window on the door one of my colleagues, a girl in her early 20s (we'll call her kate), was crying in there. Two of my other colleagues were there comforting her too. 

I continued to my desk and got on with working. When one of the other colleagues passed by I asked what was wrong with Kate, out of curiosity. My colleague tells me Kate's dog had died. I had honestly thought it would be something way worse judging by how hysterically upset Kate had looked. 

Anyway, I got on with my day. Fastforward to later, I'm on my break making a coffee. I see that Kate is doing the same, so I take the opportunity to give her my condolences because she still looked upset. She thanked me and we got talking a little, and she was telling me how she'd had this dog for *such* a long time and how it was *so* hard to deal with the loss. I humored her until she came out with something along the lines of ""I feel like I've lost a child"".

I snapped at this point. I found it extremely disrespectful to anyone who's lost a child. And to compare something as precious as a child to a dog is ridiculous to me. I said something like ""No offense but are you seriously comparing losing a pet to losing a child?"" and she seemed speechless, presumably guilty. I explained to her, quite calmly under the circumstances, why this was wrong and how insulting it was, etc. She starts crying again and walks out.

I shrug it off and assume that's the end of it. Until later that night when I receive a message from another colleague telling me how AWFUL I am for pointing out that a child is worth more than a dog. I was removed from my work group chat, and several people actually deleted me as a friend.

Back to the present day, I have now basically been exiled from the group. Most people at work are not talking to me unless they have to discuss something work related. I am not invited out for lunch anymore. Also for context the people doing this are the younger people in our office. They were already cliquey and I believe they already disliked me and have used this as an opportunity to gang up on me.

1,"AITA for telling my older brother that he has an obligation to help with the funeral of our abusive dad? | Our dad mellowed out quite a bit after I was born but back when my brother Jeff was younger, he was a real prick, as Jeff would put it. 

Jeff said Dad would knock him around when he drank (which was all the time), would constantly yell and berate both him and Mom, and was just an all around shitty human. 

I’m not sure what happened when I was born but dad mellowed out a lot after I was born. Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he’s never looked back. 

I know that he got sober not long after my birth so I’m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn’t entirely Jeff’s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. 

Well, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom & I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn’t helping at all with the funeral planning. 

She asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. 

I went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. 

He went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with “that asshole’s” funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn’t want to cause any more problems so I left. 

I haven’t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I’m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn’t want to help. 

So AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom’s sake?

0,"AITA for confronting my professor about his mistake? | I am in graduate school. I was discussing the testing accommodations process with my professor. He sent me an email asking me to meet him after class to talk about it. When I got to class today, he said: “you were supposed to come before class” and sounded mad. I told him I must have misunderstood because I thought he said after. His response was, “No. Before.” I double checked his email to make sure I didn’t get it wrong, and sure enough, he said after.

Now at this point I could have just let it go and let him accuse me of missing my appointment, or I could defend myself. I chose the latter and I am wondering if I AITA for doing so. After class, I said that I really looked at his email and he did tell me to come after class. He said, “ah, so you want to argue with me?” I said, “I’m not trying to argue, I just don’t want to be accused of something I didn’t do (not showing up to a meeting with him.) At that, he picked up his stuff and stormed out of the room.

I am feeling really shitty about this. I feel like I shouldn’t have said anything since professors should have respect from their students, but I also felt it wasn’t fair that he was accusing me of missing a meeting with him before class when he clearly told me after class in the email. I don’t want to be blamed for something I didn’t do. So did I do the right thing not letting it go or AITA? ",False,False

Now he wants to propose to her and has asked me for my engagement ring which was a family heirloom and passed down from his grandma. 

He has also asked for other pieces of jewelry back which were gifted to me from his mom and grandmother because they said they wanted to keep it in the family and see our kids have it one day. We have no children but if I have kids one day with someone else I’d be happy to give them these gifts.

1,"AITA for complaining about an Amber Alert? | Last night at around midnight, my phone, which was set to Do Not Disturb, started blaring loud klaxon horns full-volume with a message about an Amber Alert. It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).

&#x200B;

I complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to ""on"" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.

&#x200B;

Additional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short *so that* she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.  


To complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?

&#x200B;

(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been ""See? The alert worked.""  :|  )

Am I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?

1,"AITA for asking my neighbor if I can use their WiFi | So I have not had internet access at my house (had to cut that out of the budget due to losing my job) and am getting a laptop here in the next couple of weeks. I’m getting it for free as a gift and the only problem I have is that I don’t have internet to use on my laptop. 

My neighbors are usually very nice and will help out by letting me borrow their mower, help jump my car when it won’t start, just little small things. So I figured it wouldn’t be a big deal if I use their WiFi connection since they won’t even realize I’m using it. I went to their house and one of them answered the door and when I asked if I could use their WiFi, he seemed really annoyed that I asked and said “no, absolutely not.

1,"AITA for not wanting to baby my brother's one year old? | My brother's baby was difficult from day one. She would cry for everything. What I noticed early on was that my mom and brother would jump to tend to her every time she cried, even if she whimpered. She's now a little over one, walking and starting to talk but she doesn't like strangers and is super attached to mom, dad, and grandma. So attached that she cries when they leave. My brother is afraid to leave her with anyone because of the crying which I think makes things worse. When she gets going she shrieks at the top of her lungs, her nose running, and it's really hard to console her.

She slightly likes me so I watch her from time to time but when she cries for no reason, I ignore it until she calms herself down. Then I play with her. Last week she cried so hard she threw up. 

I feel like if she was given more chances to console herself, things wouldn't be so bad right now. My mom thinks I'm an asshole but I think their neurosis will rub off on the kid. What's the verdict?",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I complained about a condescending healthcare worker? | I just gave a blood donation,  whilst sitting in the waiting area afterwards one of the staff walked up to me, in front of other donors, pointed at the donor health form I filled in prior to donating and said ""It says on the form to use a black or blue pen, what colour is this young man?"" ...  now I'm colour-blind, and I thought I'd used a black pen,  so I told her as such,  she muttered ""It's green, now you need to go over the form again in black"" and sat next to me in silence while I completed the form.

0,"AITA for telling my wife she needs to relax her attitude about religion? | I grew up a Hindu, she grew up Muslim. My family never pressured me into following any faith (only thing they did was not allow beef inside the house) while hers were a lot more devout. I’ve maintained a laissez-faire attitude to it but my wife, ever since I met her has been vehemently against religion. 

As neither of us are religious, we agreed we wouldn’t raise our children (6m and 4f) in any faith.  That was working fine until a couple of months ago when my grandfather died. I realised most of my great memories of him came from my childhood where he would tell me the myths and legends from Hindu texts such as the Mahabharata and Ramayana, so I decided to use them as bedtime stories I’d tell them to my kids. In my view, they aren’t overtly religious and if you replace the word ‘god’ with ’king’ you’re pretty much set. The stories have morals, like telling the truth and being generous and kind, which are values I think the kids should learn. However, when my wife found out she firmly asked me to stop with the Hindu legends because she felt it went against our agreement, and I said I would. 

Now yesterday, she walked in on me reading to our kids from a child’s version of Greek Myths and Legends. She got far more upset saying that I was doing the same thing I’d agreed to stop doing. 

At this I said she was being ridiculous. First, I thought she objected to the Hindu stories because Hinduism is still a very popular religion and that might influence them, while with the Greek myths it’s a dead religion and no one is encouraging them to worship Zeus. Her next point was that she didn’t want mentions of God at all in the house, which I said was ridiculous. The kids were probably exposed to the concept of deity by now, either through speech, or films or tv. Besides, in my view not raising them to be religious is not the same as completely ignoring the idea of god. Finally, I said that her reaction was perhaps too severe because at 4 and 6, they probably thought it was a cool story about a bloke fighting a lion and not about a power to which they should be obedient.",False,False
0,"AITA for refusing to wipe my 8 year old niece ? | Me and my husband (soon to be ex) are separating but it’s fairly amicable. We are still living together while looking for separate housing. We have together a 9 year old daughter and he has a 8 year old niece. We don’t live at our home country and niece and her mother came to live in the same country as us a couple of months ago.
Today was the first sleep over, all went well until today. We haven’t spend a lot of time together due to living in different countries for the last couple of years, but the kids are close.

After lunch niece went to the bathroom (we all knew it because she didn’t close the door going in and screamed after getting inside to someone close the door because she was going to .. take a dump) and after 20 minutes inside, following dialogue ensued:

Niece: “Auuutie come clean me”
Me , thinking she was joking: “what do you mean, do you need more toilet paper?”
Niece: “NO! You need to clean my butt.”
Me: “Why can’t you clean yourself? You are almost 9 years old”
Niece: “yes!! But I always get shit in my back so I don’t clean myself.. my mother cleans me!!!!! Come do it”
Me: “I’m not comfortable cleaning a 8 year old butt. Your cousin learned how to when she was 4 and I haven’t done it since.. I’m sorry, but im not going to clean you.  I’m not comfortable doing so, but I can give you pointers then leave.”

She insisted a lot I refused, but gave her “pointers” on how to clean herself and left the bathroom. She called me after and told me she was clean and left the bathroom. I had to call her back there to flush and wash her hands, what she hasn’t done.

When my (ex) husband got home (he went out to take the trash) I told him finding funny the situation but he thinks I am the asshole and that I maybe should have cleaned her and that if she tells her mum, she may get upset with me. 

TLDR: 8 year old niece wanted me to clean her, I refused and told her how she should clean herself. Soon to be ex husband thinks that I was Asshole-ish and should have cleaned the child.

0,"AITA for not being considerate of my niece who’s in the weight loss surgery process? | This is an old story, and my niece is still angry about it. 

My wife, me, and my son and daughter went bowling with my two nieces, and nephew. My niece Serena (19F) has been morbidly obese for most of her life and finally decided to get weight loss surgery. She’s on a pre-surgery diet. Originally, only my family was going but my brother and sister-in-law asked if we could bring their kids along because they wanted to see their cousins. I pulled them aside and recommended for Serena to not come along because the place we go has a really nice restaurant part of it and my son and daughter always order a big burger, fries, and Coke when we go. I said it may be tempting for her, and this wouldn’t be fun. Maybe we could put together a gathering at one of our houses. 

My SIL and brother said it would be fine, she’d be able to handle it. I told them I had no problem with her coming but talk to her first. I assumed they did because we all went together the following Saturday. We enjoyed bowling for some time and then we ordered. 

My wife got a burrito and chips with dip, my son and daughter their traditional burgers, and my other niece (17F) and nephew (15M) both ordered an unholy amount of food. Teenagers get hungry certainly and there was a lot. Serena got a little red in the face and when the food arrived she blew her top off. She snapped at us that we were so disrespectful and to have a little consideration that she’s only had a smoothie and an apple today. I was surprised and asked if her parents had told her we planned to eat. She angrily said they did but she thought we’d have a little more tact and maybe eat afterwards. My daughter mentioned she was hungry and my niece just stomped off, went in her car and left.

We stayed, enjoyed the rest of our night, and upon returning home we’re assaulted with texts from my sister-in-law and brother that we’d never said we planned a whole dinner (we did), and that Serena was driven to tears her family thinks so little of her and is still crying now. Serena texted my daughter and said she knows that she’s jealous she’s losing weight and my daughter is overweight but that doesn’t mean she can try to intentionally sabotage her diet. My daughter cried, I was livid at Serena and blocked her number off my daughter’s phone.

My Mum can be quite overbearing and likes to be involved in my business since I’ve been home again, for example, when I went to visit my father a few hours away over the Christmas’s period she was texting me daily saying how much she misses and loves me. I reciprocate with a ‘love you too ma’ but the constant pandering was a little much for me. 

This issue arose again recently. Ma and her husband went on a mini break for five days. When she came back, she practically ran to me and hugged me, saying how much she had missed me. 

Here’s where I may be the arsehole. When she asked ‘did you miss me?’ I said ‘no Mum, you’ve been gone for five days and I’m 28. It’s fine’ she got very upset and started saying how much she had missed me.  I then said ‘Mum, that’s weird. You were on holiday with your husband and should have been enjoying yourself not worrying about me!’

i’m going to try sum this up as quick as possible. i (33 yo female) got pregnant at 15 with my first daughter who is now 17. after i got married i was blessed with my second daughter who is now 9 years old.

my husband and i have agreed to raise our kids strictly to avoid them making the same mistakes we did as teenagers. so we have set some rules around the house:

- the youngest has a strict curfew of 8pm and the oldest 9:30pm
- the oldest has a phone but we have enabled time limits, so she is only allowed to spend 90 minutes on instagram and snapchat per day
- neither of my daughters are allowed to wear makeup unless we are attending a wedding or other formal occasion
- their electronic devices are kept in our room after curfew
- no dating allowed for the eldest
- no locks on room doors
- random room inspections
- no private browsing allowed on devices, we check up on internet history every 1-2 weeks
- both daughters (particularly eldest) must give proof that they have done either homework or reading/writing to have access to snacks

so far this system has worked well, my daughters are performing well in school. aside from the occasional argument or two.

Ever since I was young I've had this really strong aversion to peanuts, pecans, etc you name it. My mom even at one point had me tested by a doctor to see if I had an allergy to them. Just even thinking about eating them makes me nauseous. This has never been very relevant in my life until recently. My friend group in college is constantly suggesting to go out for lunch, and Asian food is a very popular choice. The problem is that I'm also kind of a picky eater, so mixed with the use of nuts in Asian food there isn't always a lot for me to eat. I own up to this aversion, it's my problem and I don't expect anyone to change where they want to go because of this. However, me constantly ducking out of lunch has gotten suspicious because they know when I'm busy. Lately, I've been thinking about claiming the reason I can't eat anything there is because of a minor nut allergy. I in no way want or expect them to stop eating in these places since they love them, but I'm desperate for an excuse for why I can't eat anything there and they can stop trying to cajole me into eating food that makes me physically nauseous. I'm super embarrassed because it feels very childish to simply say 'I just don't like it' because to me its a real problem, but its mine and none of my friend's faults that I'm awful with food.

But the reason I yelled at him is because of what he did to my other little cousin, who is much smaller. He grabbed my little cousin, (who is 3 years old) and tried to throw him down a small flight of stairs. Luckily, instead of falling down the stairs, he landed on his butt and didn’t fall down.

My parents have been asking me to visit a lot and emotionally support her and show her how we're all a family doing it.

Well I don't want to. The whole reason for the divorce is an affair that SHE had and was totally responsible for. This is a self inflicted wound and it's her ex-husband that's the victim, not her. I tend to be aloof to her, often ignore her and just scroll past her Facebook posts when she's talking about how she feels. She completely brought this on herself.

1,"WIBTA if I block cars from leaving the carpool lane? | I was driving home in rush hour yesterday when I realized that almost every other car in the carpool lane had only one person in it. (Not including hybrids that are allowed to be there). There is also a well known trap that the highway patrol has set up to catch these lawbreakers which everyone conveniently avoids by exiting the lane a mile and a half before. 

I was talking to my coworkers today about it and told them that what I want to do is block someone from leaving the lane likely guaranteeing the driver a $400 ticket. 

People acted like I had confessed to a murder. There were arguments that I could be preventing someone from seeing a dying relative or some other kind of emergency. I said that it was much more likely that it was just people being entitled assholes.

0,"AITA for not tipping at a self serve frozen yogurt place? | The yogurt place in question is Froyoland. I used to go there all the time with my dad, but he became a health nut and so we stopped going. I went there the other day with my GF after having not been for months, and they had a new fancy register. This one looked like an IPad and would swivel so that the customer could sign when they use credit and swipe and stuff. 

Now in case you don’t know, Froyoland is self serve. You pick up a cup, then you fill it from the frozen yogurt machines and add toppings. At the end you put your cup on a scale and you pay based on weight. 

So I was a little confused when this fancy screen payment thing asked me what percent I wanted to tip. I chose 0%.

So here’s my deal. For one, I have no clue who I would be tipping, and for two, no one working there helped me do anything, so I do not see a reason to tip really. It’s not like a restaurant where the server, well, serves you. But on the other hand, I know some companies and restaurants are allowed to pay their workers less because they expect tips (which is messed up in itself, but that’s for another time and place). I don’t know if Froyoland is one of those places, and if by not tipping, I’m depriving the workers of their fair salaries.

He said he prays for me, and this kind of annoys me. I get it, he has his own coping mechanism, cool. But I don’t want him to think that my accomplishments and happiness are because he was so generous to pray for me to his sky daddy. 

I told him to stop, and he says he respects my “religion” (he used that word directly) but I have to respect his faith and expression.

So I shot her a text and she texted back she had been admitted to the hospital.

1,"AITA For listening to music on a hiking trail? | My friend invited me on a hike with a group of his own friends (whom I don't know too well).

I've never really hiked before, but it was roughly an 8 mile trail so I brought along some things to keep me occupied in case I got bored, one of which was a music player.

At the start of the hike, we walked about two miles with other groups lingering near us/passing us/us passing them. During most of the time, our group was talking to each other so I figured it wouldn't hurt to play some music to pass the time. I'm a big fan of rap so I played various songs from genres like party rap or gangsta rap.

Now I FIGURED this was ok because our group was chatty the whole time, so what difference does some music matter? And other hikers didn't stay near us that long anyways, so any music they heard would only be for a short while.

Despite this, my group suddenly went quiet. After we took our first break, my friend took me aside and asked me if I could quiet it down. I obliged and we hiked another mile and I realized our group was chatting again, I quickly started playing the music and they quieted down.

One of the group members eventually asked if I could stop playing it, I told her ""you guys are talking a lot but get upset when I play music?"" 

They told me the music was disrupting the hike, I said if they have no problems constantly chatting, they shouldn't have a problem with the music. I felt like I was getting ganged up on. Eventually one of the group members got mad and demanded they just go back to the parking lot and end the hike. 

As we were walking back, I made sure to turn the music up as loud as possible the whole way back since they thought it was ok to gang up on me for wanting to listen to it, but acceptable for them to talk.

1,"AITA for telling my mum that she would be considered higher risk if she caught COVID-19 | I thought this would be pretty simple, but the amount of arguments it's caused has made me wonder if I was out of line.

I (19F) am a massive hypochondriac, so I look at the updates for corona pretty regularly as well as statistics because it makes me feel safer. The one downside is that I'm now also concerned about my mum (56F). While she was telling me that there's no reason to be anxious, I told her that my anxiety was more about her than me. She asked why so I said that the relevant statistics show that obesity and older age make people high risk so I feel like I should take extra precautions to make sure that she doesn't get sick.

This started an argument that has now been going on for 5 days. 

My mum says that, despite her age, weight, and general health, she is a healthy person and to suggest that I'm more concerned about her than I am myself is saying that I think she is less healthy than I am. I agreed with her, because my only health issues are mental health related. 

The argument then became about her/my weight. I am on a diet because I've gained some weight over the past year (still healthy, but I'd prefer to get back to my original weight) and she says that dieting will make my immune system worse and I'll be more susceptible than her. I disagreed because I'm not starving myself or avoiding nutritious food, I'm only eating smaller portions of healthy food. According to her, me dieting puts me at a higher risk than her obesity. 

It's now at the point that I won't eat anything she's cooked because she's choosing not to wash her hands to ""prove"" that she's heathier than me, which is setting off my hypochondria and causing a lot of anxiety. I live with my mum as it's close to my university and saves money, so I can't avoid her.

My friends are telling me to keep the peace and apologize. My dad has shouted at me down the phone for making my mum stressed (they're separated but have a good relationship, he lives overseas).

0,"AITA for having a car on my property towed | First time poster. Me and my husband have been renting a house for 3 years. We are now raking the steps to own it. We have a huge front yard which wraps around. We are friendly and get along quite well with our neighbors.  Since Saturday an SUV has been parking in our grass on the side of our yard we can't see from our house but it is clearly our property.  I contacted the home owner and he said that there have been issues with this in the past and gave us a number to call the police.  Car was there this morning when I left for work, called the police they came out and said it wasn't registered to someone around here. So they told us we have to right to tow it. Once I came home the car was gone. A few hours ago the car is back ,we go to a few houses and knock on doors nobody knows whose car it is. So we get it towed.

1,"AITA for getting my girlfriend to file for child support? | My (27M) girlfriend (27F) and I started dating 3 years ago. She has an 8 year old son from her previous relationship. We also had a daughter born at the end of last year.

Things are great! Having a baby is the height of human experience, no question. We live together, the 4 of us. The biological father of her son is in his life. He gets him every other weekend, and on tuesdays/thursdays picks him up for a few hours after school and returns him before bed. 

I'm not going to add my opinion of him as a father because I don't feel it's my place, or relevant to what's going on. All I'll say is we have him 80% of the time, and provide everything for him. He doesn't have clothes at the father's, we pack him a bag every weekend he goes to stay over there. 

As far as support goes. He gives my girlfriend $400 every month. Not thru a court order, just something they agreed on years ago. Here's where my dilemma comes in. I don't think it's fair after finding out what he makes. To me he's been getting off cheap for a long time now. Not having him sleep at his house but 4 days a month means in my opinion he should be providing as much as he can for his son. 

I got the ball rolling on this a while ago. My girlfriend was against it and apprehensive at first, which really offended me as it felt like she was protecting her ex's feelings at the expense of our family's well-being. So there were plenty of arguments and nights spent sleeping away from each other. I unfortunately had to resort to an ultimatum of sorts, as it had gotten past the point of frustration for me to have to worry about anything of a financial burden when we were leaving money on the table. 

So eventually I talked her into it. She filed for a court order support. I guess when the father found out he flipped out in anger. Saying it was bullshit and my girlfriend had no right to do this to him. To me, this is manipulation. You'd only be angry about going to court if you knew the court was going to take a fair amount, what they deem acceptable for him to provide based on his income. This is him trying to get out of paying for his son and to me it's shitty behavior. So he's pissed off. To my girlfriend, the way I went about forcing the issue was unbecoming of me. I don't really care, as when the money we recieve increases, our lives will be more comfortable. I think she'll see I was right when this happens. I'm curious to see what outsiders think of this?

1,"WIBTAH If I told off people in school for eating | So I know the title sounds weird, but I have something called misophonia that basically makes me feel anxious, angry, and upset anytime I hear or see someone chewing, eating, or breathing to loud. I have had it since the 6th grade, and I am currently a sophomore in high school. With misophonia it is hard for me to function in school because if I hear or see someone chewing gum or eating I get distracted and only focus on them. This was manageable for a while, but recently it has been getting worse and worse. Last week on Monday I almost reached my breaking point.

&#x200B;

That Monday, I somehow managed to avoid breaking down and crying in front of the entire class for 7 hours. In every class I went to people around me were chewing gum or eating chips. At one point, the person directly behind me was given gum and I learned that she was the loudest chewer I've ever heard, and during that same class we have the lunch period so people come back with apples and chips. After an entire day of mental torture, I went home and snapped at anyone who messed with me. For a week after the incident I was incredibly irritable and would get super angry at people just for coughing or for me seeing them with food. I can legitimately say that that Monday was one of the worst days I have experienced in a year or two. Two days ago I was close to having a repeat incident but it didn't get as bad.

&#x200B;

Lately, I have been starting to consider telling people in school about this. I haven't told anyone at school because everyone loves their gum and chips and I feel like if I tried to explain this then they would either feel like it is a burden on them, or that I am trying to control them. When I told my family about the condition, it took them a year or two to actually start eating less around me, but it still feels like they are incredibly annoyed by it.

&#x200B;

I wanted to get some other peoples opinion about this because I don't feel like the asshole here, but I have the condition and I am almost certain that no-one else in my classes has it.

1,"AITA for being upset with my brother/best man for working on my wedding day? | Hi,

&#x200B;

So my brother is my best man. We have had a shaky relationship, but I feel like lately he has turned himself around and I thought it would be a good gesture for our relationship for him to be my best man.

&#x200B;

At the time, my brother was unemployed, and I figured that meant more time for him to be there for me with the wedding stuff. A couple weeks ago he got a new job and I congratulated him, at the same time politely reminding him that he makes sure he gets off the wedding day as to be there for me to prepare. He told me he did and everything is good to go.

&#x200B;

That was a month ago, we are now two weeks to the wedding and my dad (not him) informed me that the person that was supposed to 'cover' his shift that day called out, so now he has to go in that day. While he would still technically be able to attend the wedding (ceremony starts at 7, he gets off at 3 and is an hour away), this puts a HUGE damper on the plans we had as every person in the bridal party had a role to play in getting ready.

&#x200B;

I called my brother and asked him to let his boss know that's it's unacceptable that he needs to go in to work that day and that they need to figure it out. He told me to 'calm down bro' and that he can't do anything about it- with this attitude of not caring.  It upset me. He's my best man and he won't be there for the majority of the day.

I don't want my brother to get fired from his new job obviously, but I feel like he isn't prioritizing his role as best man for me.

I got pregnant and then found out I was the other woman, they broke up, we (ex-wife and I) became best friends, she started dating someone new that was also a friend of mine at the time, and they moved away with my daughter's sister. 

Well, I firmly believe, because of my own past, that my daughter should not be deprived of a relationship with her siblings. So I encouraged, as much I as I could in my own single motherhood, no money position, to make it happen. As soon as she was old enough to fly by herself, I sent my daughter out to see her sister every summer for a month or so, even if I went without. I even sent her with a few hundred dollars for this time because she eats like a horse and I know they aren't exactly rich. 

Well, love of my life walks in, we build a life together, and end up moving close to them for work reasons. Pleasant surprise for everyone involved. 

Who they were when I physically saw them last, is not who they are now, and I have recently discovered that when I sent my daughter out to see them, I was subjecting her to squalid living conditions with meth addicts. It's subtle, nothing they can't hide from a surprise CPS visit. I see her bf grooming my daughter's sister, who is now 14 years old. Nothing illegal has happened (yet) so nobody with any authority can do anything. Believe me, I've tried. I've called every law enforcement agency I can find and they can't do jack shit.

 My daughter and her sister, They love each other, and are best friends, even with so many years between them. I can't end this relationship, can I???

I talked to Mom about it, she says she sees it too, and has been told by other people, but refuses to leave. 

I have sent them money whenever they needed it, supplied gifts and school clothes for my daughter's sister for years, even when I could barely pay my own bills, but I can't anymore. For a while I felt like I should keep minimal contact because I understood being in a situation who feel like you can't leave, but I would rather live on the street than subject my own child to this, and I feel that by continuing to provide support and contact, my own child is in danger. I've offered to take her myself, even just for the summer, but mom refuses.

Their lease is up in January so he’s still paying his half but after that, it’s up to his ex to pay it on her own. She can’t afford it so she’s been looking for a new place to stay but it’s very hard. We live in a tourist town so not only is year round housing expensive, it’s also incredibly hard to find. I’d say 85-90% of landlords around here prefer to rent their properties out as weekly vacation rentals. 


My son had an easier time finding a place because he’s a truck driver, meaning their child isn’t with him the majority of the time. He’s either with me or his mom. So my son was able to move 30 minutes away where year round rentals are much cheaper and easier to find. 

His ex can’t move there because the schools are crap.  The schools in our town are amazing, some of the best in our state iirc. 


My husband and I live in a house that was built to be a vacation home. Our main house is on stilts and there’s a 1.5* bedroom apartment underneath. It’s tiny but it’s got a full kitchen and bathroom. 


*I say .5 bedroom because one of the rooms isn’t technically a room(no windows or closet) but it’s big enough for a twin bed and a small dresser. 


We used to use it for my MIL to stay in when she would visit so she didn’t have to walk up the stairs but she has passed away. It’s now used as a guest “room” but we don’t get many guests. 


I told my son’s ex she could live there. We only asked for 2 things; money towards groceries($50 a month to go towards dinner and snacks for our grandson when we watch him and they are welcome to eat dinner with us whenever) and to pay for any damage her cat may do (don’t think this will be an issue but just in case). 


I don’t see the issue. She’s a nice girl. We have a close relationship due to us being the go to babysitters for our grandson(not an issue at all, we love it!). And I know her landlord personally and he has nothing but positive things to say about her(and my son).

1,"AITA For Telling My Boss To Not Hire Someone After I Initially Recommended Her? | I'm M23 and I was on the subway a few months ago and heard two girls talking who were around my age (new grads) and one was talking about how she wanted to get into software/tech sales when she finishes school this year. I kinda jumped into the convo and introduced myself because I'm in software sales and just got a promotion from the entry level role she'd need to start at. I told her some good companies in our city, what the day to day is like, how to evaluate a good company, and what pay to expect. I gave her my card which has all my info and told her if she wants a referral to my company or more help landing a gig in sales I'll be more than willing to help. She was surprised but thankful to me and I got off without giving her a second thought really. I have helped people before break into sales and I had like 3-4 people help me when I finished school so I'm always looking to help and pay it forward. 

She reached out to me via text and we went in depth into compensation, how to interview properly, how to make cold calls, cold emails etc. How to apply for sales jobs and basically everything that would land her a great job. The one problem I had with her is that she was pretty rude, rarely ever thanked me for all the help I was giving her, and when we'd text or call she'd end the convo with a K BYE. I remember thanking everyone that was helping me so much for even taking the time to talk to me when people were helping me land a job, but she acted like she was doing me a favour and not the other way around. I still gave her a referral to my company and prepared her to interview with my current boss and former manager and we roleplayed a lot of scenarios etc. But she was pretty rude imo throughout, and was acting like I was trying to get into her pants maybe. 

She had the interview and because of our prep did well, my boss said he'd hire her and asked for more feedback on her from myself, and I just flat out told him that she's rude and was unappreciative of the help I gave her so we shouldn't hire her. He didn't care and was like OK. 

HR let he know she didn't get the job and she called me kinda pissed and I told her I told my boss to not hire her because she was rude to me throughout my time helping her and was unappreciative to me. She called me a huge douche, fuckboy, and that I only wanted to fuck her and she was being cold to me so I'd get the hint I didn't have a chance.

We'd save the money and keep it in an account, he can have it back after he moves out. It'd be over half of his paycheck to get him down to a reasonable income (60 a week) for a sixteen year old. He has no expenses, aside from gas for the car he shares with his twin; they rarely fill the tank up more than twice a month.

He just bought his girlfriend of two months a five hundred dollars guitar; we don't like his spending habits and want him to save some of this for later in life. We're not extremely wealthy, he doesn't have the college fund or trust that I had when I was his age and I want him to have a safety net, but he won't listen to us about saving money, so in essence we plan on forcing him to do so.

We've had some pushback from relatives saying that we're being too strict or taking his hard earned money. Obviously, he's not happy about it either, but he said he'd keep the job regardless because he likes it (he's working at our friend's store). We told him that if he wants to make ""adult"" money, he can pay ""adult"" bills. He's well aware he'll get it back when he moves out. Several relatives are saying he's young, and to let him enjoy frivolous spending while he can. We're on the fence about the issue.",False,False

1,"AITA for continuing my run after a friend gets hurt | I've run on aggressive trails for a decade. My main man, ""Pumpkin,"" who is also a seasoned trail runner, was visiting me over Thanksgiving. I have a local friend, ""Bill,"" who started running recently, sticking to treadmills and roads. I introduced him to trail running (we've run together 3 times) a few weeks ago.

Pumpkin and Bill come to my house to run while Bill's and my wife go shopping. The day before Bill and I ran 10 miles, which was his longest run thus far (read: he was fatigued). The three of us head to a local trail network that has about 16 miles of technical routes. We decided to do about 8 miles.

A mile into our run Bill goes down on a root. He's grabbing his ankle, which is swelling, and he's clearly in pain. He runs internal diagnostics to determine the damage. No one here is a doctor, but Pumpkin and I have had serious running injuries. After a while Bill is able to stand, put weight on his injured foot, and limp. His run is clearly done.

Here's where I think ITA. We determine Bill can walk back to the trailhead. Pumpkin and I sprint to the car (a mile away) to pickup Bill midway. Pumpkin or I should have walked with him while the other got the car.

We meet him at the trailhead. Bill debates going straight to the doctor, and I tell him I'll drive him anywhere he wants. Sadly, his wife took their car keys so he's dependent on someone else. I drive to my house and Pumpkin and I get him settled with his foot elevated with an ice pack, drinks, snacks, and the remote. He's adamant Pumpkin and I finish our run, so we shorten our planned distance and I tell him I'll take him anywhere he wants to go when we return.

At my house alone, Bill is diagnosing himself via WebMD. Pumpkin and I were confident it's a bad sprain and tried to him convince him before leaving. Bill texts his wife, who is an hour away, that he is concerned it is broken and she considers going back to my house before they can get any shopping done. Bill's wife is being driven by my wife with our baby in the car.

She suggests he reach out to a friend who lives 45 minutes away to take him to the doctor's, which he does. I do not have my phone on me during this time.

Pumpkin and I return about an hour after dropping Bill off and learn he's been taken to the doctor's by the friend who drove 1.5 hours to do so. I text Bill and tell him I'll pick him up from the doctors and take him to lunch after he's done. Like any emergency visit, it takes hours. His wife returns and joins him.

He has a mild-to-moderate sprain with an air cast and must rest for at least a week. Full recovery expected within 2-3 weeks.

My wife claims Pumpkin and I have no emotional intelligence and should have stayed with him. It is his first running injury and he has only been to our house 3 times prior. She also says we should have kept our phones on us during the run.

My perspective is I gave Bill multiple options and he chose to hang out at my house while we finished the run.

1,"AITA if I don’t want my son to speak Spanish with his father | You’ll see, my husband’s parents are both from Argentina, this means that he is very connected to their culture and even speaks Spanish fluently. And so when our son (10M)  started to get interested in his father’s culture, he taught him the language. At first he didn’t really speak it at home, only when he was practicing it with my husband. 

But recently he has started to speak Spanish with his father at home. For example when he wants my husband to help him he calls him in Spanish, when they are doing something together they talk Spanish or when we are in the living room but and I’m reading a book they have conversations in Spanish. It feels like they are excluding me, or like they didn’t want me to understand them. 

So when last night I was with my husband in our bed and suddenly our son shout something in Spanish, I ask my husband what happened but he just walk out of the room without saying anything. I was really scared until I realized my son had lost his book. I was really angry after this, I didn’t knew what had happened and my husband didn’t even told me. I told him that he couldn’t speak Spanish with our son anymore, except when they were practicing it, I’m done with being left out. My husband is really angry at me but accept it. But my son didn’t, he know refuses to speak with me and only speaks with my husband.

I understand that my son liked it but it was really uncomfortable to not know what my own son was saying.",False,False
0,"AITA for keeping a gift solely for my son rather than splitting it between him and my girlfriend's kids? | I’ve been with my girlfriend for four years now.  I have a son from a previous relationship and she has two children of her own from her’s.  My son is turning 18 very shortly and will be graduating.  Her children are 12 and 14.  

Pretty much since my son was born I’ve put aside money for him in a separate bank account.  When I first started I was never able to add much to it, but I worked my ass off and made sacrifices in order to be able to put in what I could.  It now has over $40k in it.  I’ve been shooting for an even 50, but came up short.  Still I’m proud that all my hard work and sacrifices are about to pay off for him.  I’ve daydreamed about being able to do this for him too many times to count.  

My girlfriend knew about the account. There have been some hard times in our relationship where using some of the money would have made things easier, but it was always a hard line for me not to touch it.  She was never happy about it per say, but would eventually respect my decision.   Now that my son will soon be graduating however we’ve come to a point where we are unable move past.   She doesn’t want me to give the full amount to my son, she wants to split it three ways between all of the children and to give her children their thirds when they graduate. 

We are a great team usually.  It’s almost unheard of for us not to be able to work through issues and come to an agreement so this is sort of new territory for us as neither is willing to budge on this issue so far.  She’s fighting dirty too, she’s been making it out as if I don’t really love her children. At least not as much as my son.  I do love her kids.  That’s not in question, but the truth is of course I love my son more.  I feel like that shouldn’t even be that controversial of a thought.  I truly doubt she loves my son as much as her own children even if she’d never admit it. 

I honestly don’t even know if I would be able to split it up even if I chose too.  This is been something I broke my back over and gave up things for myself for for almost 18 years now.  Even thinking about splitting it up is difficult for me.  Inside there’s just a big “NO” feeling that comes up when I try to consider it. 

I also feel like it’s really shitty for my girlfriend to make this such a demand.  Putting this money aside was never easy and she had no part in that.  In fact she did pretty much the opposite putting herself into debt(which I now help pay off) and I don’t particularly feel that she should have deciding power over this money. 

Neither of us have been backing down and it won’t be too much longer until it’s time to give him the money.  ",False,False
1,"AITA For basically calling a dad a shitty dad at a movie theater? | Right, so took my girlfriend to go see Toy Story 4 today. She's been excited for weeks about this, and I knew she wasn't going have many days off until it was out of circulation. So, we get tickets, and sit down. And we sit next to a father, and two girls, had to be about 6-8.

All through the movie, the kids are bouncing around and talking the whole time. And I can tell my girlfriend is getting pissed. I'm getting annoyed, too, but I recognize they're just kids. They don't know better; they're dad, on the other hand, is a different story. My dad would have pulled my ass out of the theater, and basically told me to cut the shit, or we were going home.

I looked over to their dad, and he was on his phone. Which absolutely infuriated me. Kids talking during the movie is one thing, but a father basically doing nothing to stop it gets to me. Keep in mind, the two girls were actually sitting next to me, so the father was two seats away. So I ask the father to get off his phone. He gives me a look, but puts the phone away. For about a half hour. Again, not saying anything to the kids, as they legitimately talked through the entire movie. I actually get up to tell an usher, but of course no one actually does anything.

Movie is over, and I'm livid. Mainly because I can tell this really affected my girlfriend's experience. The family is leaving, and of course, they leave their shit in their seat. So I just say, as he's leaving, ""yep, of course you're not going to clean up after yourself."" Guy pretends he isn't listening, so I just say, "" Pretty awful parenting you're doing there.""

The guy turns around, and basically says that it's been a long week, and he just wanted his daughters to see the movie. Separation, he has the kids all week this week, and all that jazz. So, I say, ""yeah, and you're sharing this theater with other people. Going to a movie doesn't mean you get to be a shitty parent. I guess we're just lucky you didn't take the kids swimming, right?""

That's when the guy proceeds to tell me to go fuck myself, and leaves with his daughter. And yeah, a good part of me feels like an asshole now. Maybe I should have just let bygones be bygones.

1,"AITA For Throwing Milk At My Girlfriend? | My girlfriend and I have been seeing each other for just over a year and a half. We have a great relationship, and rarely ever get into a fight. 

But this morning was different.

I wanted a bit of harmless fun, so I grabbed the 6 pint bottle of whole milk from the fridge and underhand tossed it towards her after I waited for her to turn around, and after I said ""think fast"". She didn't think fast. She put her hands up to her face and screamed. The bottle fell down onto the ground, the lid came off, and milk went everywhere.

We were both upset. She was upset because I threw milk at her, and I was upset that she was upset, because I did say ""think fast"" before throwing it, and it's not like she doesn't know the 'rules' of think fast. I was also upset because she made me clean it up.

This is making me reconsider our compatibility for one another, and it's making her reconsider the same thing. She hasn't spoken to me in a few hours and is ignoring my messages. She's locked herself in the bathroom and isn't making a sound.

1,"AITA for erasing my (18F) mom´s (57F) Netflix account? |  School is making me miserable rn. The only bearable part of the day is when I get to watch Parks and Rec. on the family TV. I had the TV about an hour and a half when my mom demanded that I give her the remote. She didn´t ask, she just demanded. I said it was my turn and she could have had it any other time of day (from the time she woke up to about 7 p.m.). I said that I would let her have the TV after the 20-minute episode.  She said she wanted it now, I said no, she turned the TV off and took a cable making it impossible for me to watch. I changed the remote batteries to ones I thought didn´t work (they did) and deleted her Netflix account. 

To be fair, I was trying to be an asshole. I went to my room to continue watching the episode, before having to do homework, again. My brother (28M) tried to act like some sort of moral agent and went and started to scold me? I wasn´t having any of it, especially from him, who is super mean to mom, literally all the time. I told him to get out of my room. He said I should apologize, I said no, so he took the internet away from me. I NEED the internet. Can´t sleep cause of stress, so I use internet, I have online classes, homework, an exam tomorrow, etc. Also there is absolutely nothing to do, we are in quarantine. 

After thinking about what I did, I felt a little bad about what I did, so I swallowed my pride (extremely hard to do after being raised by a mom who has never said sorry) and went and apologized. She was ready to forgive me, but when I said I wanted an apology too, she freaked and said she was my mom and she deserved respect. I agree but I don´t think it means she deserves to get away with things just because of it. Also, I think I also deserve respect. I am legally and adult I think it is ridiculous that I am being grounded. I am the asshole, but is she too?

1,"AITA for writing a letter to corporate and getting a Chipotle worker reprimanded | I woke up a little early today and wanted to grab a chipotle burrito before I went to class. I arrived right as the store opened. I ordered the usual which includes guac. However, before the girl working the counter could scoop I noticed the guac was slightly brown and looked like it was probably from the night before.

When I asked if I could get fresh guac she responded by stirring the brown guac and almost scooping it right on my burrito. I told her no I don’t want the brown guac. For some reason this really irritated me and I couldn’t bring myself to ask when freshly made guac would be available.

I paid and ate my burrito in the store and typed an email to corporate right then and there. I said how slighted I felt by this girl who obviously didn’t care about her job at all and how she might as well have spat in my face, which I realize now was probably a little harsh.

1,"AITA for not caring if my neighbor is annoyed by our dogs? | My wife and I live in a relatively quiet neighborhood in a major metropolitan area. This is a up and coming neighborhood, where houses are reasonably nice, in a reasonably desired area, so this is not a very fancy neighborhood. We have two dogs (beagle 1yr and hound mix 7 yrs) and a fenced in back yard. Our dogs, being both hounds are relatively loud, and when the beagle gets excited, she runs around in the back making this excited yelping noise usually no longer than 1-2 min. They also bark at passersby and the neighbor when she is out in her back yard (through a wooden fence). When they are barking across the fence they are wagging their tails and appear to want to play with the other dog. When my wife and I are getting home from work or leaving they get very excited and will yelp or bark a bit as we are coming up the driveway. Whenever they start to bark, we either let them inside if we are not outside or go over to them to try and quiet them. We do not leave them outside when we are not home and usually the barking is no longer than 15-30 seconds depending on the situation. On usual days they are not left outside for more than 2 hours or so at a time and we do everything we can to keep them quiet at night. The beagle can get excited when we let her out before bed, but in general after 9 or so there is no barking. We have been planted a lot of plants and made the backyard very pleasant to sit in and frequently sit back there with both of the dogs.

&#x200B;

Our neighbor has a dog, who is ""dog-aggressive"" and apparently frightened of other dogs as well. She feels that she cannot take her dog out into her back yard while our dogs are in ours due to him being scared of our dogs barking at him across the fence. We have suggested letting them meet, but the neighbor does not think her dog would be friendly to ours. Our neighbor and my wife text and she complains about our dogs all the time and also yells at our dogs to shut up across the fence. She suggested getting them bark collars that spray citronella when they bark. We did that and it worked for all of about 1 week before they decided that wasn't enough of a deterrant and started ignoring it. My wife tries to look out our bathroom window to ensure that the neighbor isn't in her backyard before letting our dogs out. Now the neighbor has asked us to make a schedule for when our dogs can go outside. My wife and I have irregular schedules and that would be challenging, but honestly I think it is kind of ridiculous and I don't think we need to.

0,"AITA for consuming a ""free"" alcoholic beverage after being informed it was against policy for the resteraunt to give free alcohol? | This happened yesterday and I still feel weird about it.

Yesterday was my birthday and my husband and I went to a popular seafood chain with a seasonal all-you-can-eat special. 

Seeing how busy it was due to the promotion, we sat at the bar and each ordered one beverage to consume while waiting. We paid for these drinks and tipped at the bar prior to moving to our dining tables. 

At the table we ordered our specials, and a second drink each while eating (though not at the same time; my drink order was first). At one point I realized that the waitress was attentive to our additional courses, but had forgotten my drink - she happily brought it when reminded, and felt bad. However, when nearly finished, my husband (who ordered his drink after me, with a new course) remembered his now forgotten beer and decided that so close to being finished that he need not ask about it. Knowing a birthday cake awaited me at home, we would not need dessert, either. 

The waitress came, asked if we wanted further orders, and we said that we thought we were finished. We did not inquire about the beer. However, instead of bringing the cheque as anticipated, she brought the beer and said, ""Here is the beer anyway, but I will be taking it off your order"". Shortly afterwards, the manager came.
She started off with, ""I know you won't be drinking the beer but we cannot credit off the alcohol. Instead I can credit off $10 from the bill."" We were a bit confused with the wording but nodded in agreement. After going through with the transaction, the manager made a move to the drink and said, ""Can I take this away now?"". Confused, my husband explained that it was implied he was being given the drink. He didn't argue, only stated a fact. The manager replied that it was against policy to provide free alcohol, but left the drink on the table and walked away.

We both sat there, confused, not knowing what to do. I asked if we should leave it. We mulled it over. On one hand, he had planned on leaving it be prior to all this. On the other, we knew it would be dumped out, as we had seen this happen (rightfully) at the bar with a returned order earlier. We also didn't want the waitress to get into trouble. (Please note at this point a tip had been left for the waitress when squaring our bill with the manager - we had seen no reason to be withholding despite two drink mix ups). I reasoned that technically the $10 was removed from the entire order, not specifically the drink and so the beer itself was not free, even if intended.

In the end, my husband drank his beer at an appropriate pace (he did not just pound it down) while we carried on our conversation in the busy restaurant until he was finished.

So we decided upon a sushi place we’ve never been to with great reviews. We walked in and the waiter was nice enough, but the prices were hella expensive.


In total 9 pieces of sushi was 12$, and a salad was 5$. So in total we ended up paying 34$ for all the food. Which is a lot in terms of sushi. Here’s the thing I don’t mind paying for expensive food if the food is good and it fills me up.


The sushi wasn’t good. Each piece was dry, and dipping it soy sauce was no good because the soy sauce was overly salty and lacked any flavor. The salad was actually really good, but it was so small it was laughable. I mean seaweed salad that was served was smaller than my fist overall.  


Maybe it’s because I’m hungry but I got pretty salty and felt robbed blind for shitty food that didn’t even fill me up. So I payed the bill and refused to pay the tip.


Here’s where I’m not sure if ITA, the waiter was ok, didn’t talk much but he was nice.

MIL was nice enough, about 5 minutes into our meal she starts talking about how she has started selling a supplement (juice based) and proceeds to hand me her freshly printed business card. It says she is a ‘certified nutritionist’ (she doesn’t know my educational background). 

Fact: there is no such thing as a’ certified nutritionist’ in fact the word nutritionist holds no meaning academically, anyone can claim this. (If you want to see a professional, make sure they are a registered dietitian) 

I tried to change the subject several times. But when she said something along the lines of : “I specialize in food intolerances and allergies” I called her out. I told her calmly (in my regular speaking voice.... the table could hear) that how she promoted herself was dangerous, and there was no such thing as a certified nutritionist. I added that she could be found liable if one of her “patients” had adverse effects due to her negligence.

1,"WIBTA for testing my boyfriend? | So a short backstory on me, I am a model. And with that most of my previous relationships stem from the guys I am dating on really dating me because of my looks and the ""status symbol"" of dating a model not because of me as a person.

This is something that has caused a lot of anxiety and depression in my life and I have been really trying to find people in my life that care about me not what I look like. Now that is not to say that my looks can't play a role (physical attraction is important to me as well) but I can't be with anyone where that is the only or main reason why they are dating me.

So that brings me to a guy a started dating fairly recently. I really like him and he seems like a good guy. Takes interest in my hobbies and is supportive of what I do. He enjoys lazy days around the house and cooking for me at home instead of always wanting to go out (which with a lot of guys it just seemed like they wanted to show me off). So I really really like him.

But his friend DM'd me the other day and told me, ""Hey, just thought you should know. You boyfriend has been telling anyone who will listen about all the dirty shit he gets to do with 'this model chick I have been banging'. I'd want to know. Hope for the best!""

I have only met this guy once and I don't know how close he is to my boyfriend nor do I know why he told me this. For all I know he is just trying to start drama.

We got to talking about life and shit once most people had left, she was last single person who hadn't gone home yet (but everyone elses so was off doing other stuff, mine at her sisters house watching her niece). 

She got quiet and said she had a question /needed advice. She wanted to know if we thought there was a reason she was single, since she was sick of it. One of the other girls said her 'standards' were kinds high, to which she took offense. I said her attitude was a bit uppity and entitled, she again got upset and wanted clarification. We said that her refusal to date men below the upper middle class, and how she looks down on men below it (which yeah she does shit talk them a lot saying they aren't worthy of her or real men need to keep up and such) and that will scare even upper class men away unless they just want a one nighter.

She was visibly upset and said she shouldn't have to settle for anything less than she deserves. Which yeah she is the 2nd highest income earner in our group, bringing home a tad over 100k a year. The third friend with us chimed in and said that shes doing herself a disservice by keeping her dating pool so small. That the wealthier guys go after less wealthy women all the time so she ls got a ton more competition than guys in her income bracket do. She said she shouldn't have to settle for a loser she has to take care of jusr because of all the trophy and house wife wanna be wh*res out there taking all the good men. This admittedly made me mad, my finace plans to stay at home once we get married, and I make similar income to her high income.  I said if you didn't want to her our opinion she shouldn't have asked. I left then apparently after that she started crying about being alone and how we were mean to some of the others. Which made me (and I assume the friends that she asked) wake up to some *very* upset texts from her best gal pals on the group.

Did we do wrong? All we tried to do was answer honestly.",False,False
1,"AITA for getting upset over a wig? | TLDR:  Mentioned I was into red hair, friend amazon primed a red wig as a joke, wife and I laughed about it but she wouldn't try it on, cleaning up several months later going to throw it away and try one more time get her to wear it, wife again declines and accuses me of trying to change her not being satisfied with her natural hair etc...

My wife and I have been together since dating in high school, married for just over 9 years now.  We're a pretty vanilla couple, been faithful to each other had a couple of kids and enjoy each other.  We don't get into disagreements often, we usually defer to the other in order to avoid conflict.

It was innocent enough, somehow the conversation got onto hair colors at a party and I mentioned that I kinda had a thing for red hair.  A couple days later found a mystery Amazon package on the porch and opened it to find a red wig inside.  We figured out it was a friend at the party who had sent it as a joke, my wife and I laughed about it.  She wouldn't try it on complaining that it made her head itch thinking about it.

The wig got tossed on a shelf and forgotten about for several months.  We were cleaning and organizing this morning and found the wig once again.  I asked wife to try it on for me before we threw it away but she still wouldn't.  She accused me of not loving her as she is, wanting to change her, not caring that it made her itch thinking about it.  I told her I wasn't asking her to change her hair, I do love her natural hair color the red is just kinda my thing and I wanted to see what she would look like.

As it goes this stupid red wig has become a big deal.  I'm annoyed she wouldn't just try it on for me, she thinks I'm unsatisfied and ""hate her hair"".  I had to leave shortly after the dispute, I texted her and apologized for being upset but she's left me on read for several hours now.",False,False

today at 9.30pm i felt hungry and craved something sweet at the same time so i decided to make crepes to satisfy both of my needs. 

so i went to the kitchen and started making them and heard my mom watering her garden so i finished the batter quickly and took it to my room because i didnt want her to know that i was making something. 

*the last time i wanted to make food at 9 she yelled at me so i went to my room without eating anything. (i didnt have any dinner that day)

i waited for her to finish and go to her room and then i went back to the kitchen to cook the crepes which was at 10.30. then i cleaned and went to my room to play online games with my friends. 

at 2am i heard my dad and little brother making noise and then my mom came out and i heard that my little brother was vomiting. that meant that my mom was changing sheets etc. 

i wanted to come out of my room and help but if you dont know...
You cant pause an online game.

so after my game i came out of my room and asked whats up with my bro and hows he doing and she just yelled at me, told me nothing was wrong. and then started yelling at me about how i made crepes and she said that...

""all you do is eat eat eat""
""why do you always cook so late""

My husband recently got offered a promotion RIGHT before our son was born. He works driving transport was offered to drive to a city that's 8 hours away, stay over night then come back the next day, thus meaning I will be home alone with both kids two nights a week. Today was his last day of leave and he ended up going into work in town. Last night my son WOULD NOT SLEEP! so I was running on very little sleep this morning when we got up. I put him in his swing and went to take care of me (take my meds, get something to eat, something to drink) and he starts crying, screaming his head off because he's hungry AGAIN I had JUST fed him. So in the middle of me getting breakfast I get a bottle ready and put it in the microwave, as it's warming up I grab the waffles from the freezer and a bunch of stuff falls out So I'm trying to get that back in while my kid is screaming and I forget about the bottle and end up making it to hot so now I'm running the bottle under cold water to cool it down. I get my waffles made, get the bottle and head to the living room I set my stuff down bring the bottle over and go to prop it up with a burp sheet, I normally don't do that but I needed the space in that moment. When I went to prop it up I stepped on my husbands shoe that for SOME REASON is in the middle of the living room and I almost fall. I get the bottle propped with the first sheet and go to grab a second one when I trip AGAIN on these fucking shoes. So I picked them up and to let out some of my anger I went to throw them at the closet door by the front door. Well one of them I threw and somehow hit the tv so I turn it on to see how bad it is and the left side of it was all lines so you couldn't see the screen. So I call my husband at work and I'm hardly able to get out what happened because I'm crying so hard. You could hear in his voice that he was LIVID!! but thankfully he didn't lose his shit on me. I spent the next 3 hours ugly crying and feeling awful. He ended up going and getting a new one but obviously he's still pissed. We've hardly talked today. To top it off, he makes a comment about how he didn't get to finish setting up his truck (he does his first over night trip tomorrow) so that made me feel better.. It made me start silently crying again because I feel like all he cares about is work, this whole week that he's been off he won't stop talking about this new route and how he's bored because he's not at work.

0,"AITA for having the nickname 'untouchable', apparently culturally appropriating the name of a marginalized group? | I'm Indian-American, from New Jersey. I play soccer and am known to be pretty damn good. As a result, people have come up with a nickname for me: untouchable, as in nobody on the pitch can touch me-- I'm too fast, my ball-handling skills are too good. You get the idea. I can't say I wasn't proud of the nickname-- the fact people liked me, a high schooler, enough to be fans and give me a badass nickname really was flattering, so I encouraged it.

&#x200B;

As it happens to be (I just found out recently), there's a whole caste of Indian people known as untouchables for the exact opposite reason-- they're seen as dirty and thus not touched, and are marginalized. As it happens to be, my ancestors were a different caste who sat at the head of the caste system and lorded over the rest. I was informed of this by a girl who happened to be said marginalized caste, and she tells me it's 'cruelly ironic' how I come from the top of Indian society but have called myself the opposite. She also told me I should stop.

I think she's making too much of a big deal about it-- it's incidental, with a completely different context and meaning. I shouldn't have to tell people to stop calling me what they want because of a coincidence.

1,"AITA for expecting equal treatment? | Some background - I (19f) have been staying with my brother -B- (23m) and his long term boyfriend -K- (25m) for the time being for obvious reasons. My only other option was going home to our parents who I don't get along with.

Since living with them I've noticed a few things. Like when my brother cooks he always sets aside some of the leftovers for his boyfriend to have for lunch which means it's off limits even if I want more. He told me after a few days that I had to limit my shower time to under thirty minutes and after I told him I needed extra time because I'm a girl he laughed and said that's a stupid and untrue. He also does his boyfriend's laundry, evening ironing his things. When I asked him to do mine too he said I was grown and could do it myself. Well, if I'm grown so is K.

At one point I drank the last of this really good orange cream float drink and K got mad at me because he apparently makes them special for B. I hadn't noticed that the bottle was marked with my brother's name or obviously I wouldn't have drank it which I told him. He rolled his eyes at me and told me to pay more attention next time.

1,"AITA for telling my daughter [26F] that I [55M] will not walk down the aisle with her stepdad [50M]. | My wife and I divorced when my daughter was 6 years old, and my wife had custody of my daughter for the most part since I was too busy working 50 hours a week, she quickly moved on to be with another man 7 years younger than her. I knew from many stories I've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. This may sound immature but I made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that I was her only father and to not betray me. But I have no control over what she or they do in their home. Fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. She has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me I would be the one to do it. Even though I know they're very close, I don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. I am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. I got a bit angry and told her I absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy I barely know. She told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that I'm being petty over something that happened years ago. I told her I wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but I won't be there to see it. 

I was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their kids or parents, so I wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle.",False,False

1,"WIBTA if I told my MIL she has to sell her house and get a new one if she wants the baby to spend time at her house? | I’m currently pregnant, so this isn’t an issue so far, and SO and I haven’t brought it up to his mother yet. I wanted other people’s opinions before we committed to the fight that this will ultimately be. 

A few months ago (February) MiL discovered she had cockroaches. They were just babies at the time, and it was only two they found even though they cleaned the whole house. So she told us they were gone, and considering they’d cleaned the whole house and only found those two, we believed her. 

Last week we were at her house and there was a HUGE cockroach on her wall. She just shrugged and squished it, going “Idk where they keep coming from!” SO and I believe they are living in her walls, and are now past the baby phase, and she’ll likely be infested with them soon enough. We didn’t mention anything, but took the baby things we had stored there out ASAP. 

Now we’re in the position where we don’t want the baby down to her house at all until we know the cockroaches are gone.. but we’ll never really know. She’d easily lie to us and say that they’re gone so she can see the baby. We considered paying half to have a professional come in and get rid of them, but the issue is they don’t clean their house often. Dishes are often left out, along with food, FIL has done some half assed repair jobs (newspaper in the wall to patch a hole, near a sink, perfect moist conditions for cockroaches). So if we pay the money to have it done, they’ll inevitably end up with them again. 

We’re thinking of telling her the baby won’t be going to her house - she’s more than welcome to come to ours. But if she wants overnights/spend time with the baby at her house, she needs to sell the house, and move to an area that has less bugs in general (she lives in the poorer part of the city, bedbugs and cockroaches are an issue in that area). We don’t feel like it’s too bad of a compromise - she’s talked about selling her house before.

Now, I don‘t give a damn about anyone’s religion as long as they don’t shove it in my face and I respect people with conviction...
But while I respect her for her choice, I don’t want to be in a relationship with a religious person. It’s less that I don’t like religion but more that I feel worried about having someone with a collectivist mentality next to me (all religions are collectivist to the core).

They're 10, 12 and 13 (nearly 14). 6 months ago I gifted the 13 year old a tablet (with my sister's permission). Since my sister and her ex husband divorced the 13 year old has had some anger issues. I've tried to get my sister to get him to see someone but not had any luck. He doesn't get violent with other people but when he gets really angry/upset/frustrated I have seen him throw objects across the room.

A couple months ago my sister came to me and said that money is a lot tighter this year but she wants her kids to have a good Christmas as it's their first one post-divorce. The ex husband is being a dick about Christmas and won't collaborate with her on presents (he won't split the cost or divvy up the lists, and he's apparently buying the kids half a dozen stupidly expensive presents each). The two younger kids both wanted tablets like the oldest son has, and the dad is not getting these, so my sister said she would.

She asked me if she transferred me the money to pay for one of the tablets, would I be willing to pay for the second and store them at my place so the kids can't find them. I agreed but suggested we wait for black friday and do it then, and she said that was a good idea. The two tablets have since arrived and are wrapped up and ready to go.

In the time between me ordering the 2 tablets and now the 13 year old has had another anger incident, and this time he threw the tablet I bought him 6 months ago. The screen is shattered, but when my sister got it repaired the actual image was seriously distorted, the touch screen was unusable and the memory was wiped. The guy said the throw had broken the actual machinery so it was beyond fixing at that stage.

My sister said we needed to figure out what we were doing with the tablets. My solution was to return them so no one gets a tablet and the new ones can't be broken, which sucks but the kids will get more upset if their brother smashes their tablets. Failing that we just give the littleuns their tablets and the 13 year old gets a talk about not throwing tablets across the room.

My sister's solution was to buy the 13 year old a new tablet, so all 3 kids get one each. She wanted me to chip in on the third tablet.

My response was that that sounded like a terrible idea. The kid needs therapy, not another tablet to throw across the room.

My sister's response was that these are her kids and she'll decide. Then there was a gap of an hour before she messaged saying she was sorry she snapped, she's just frustrated, and she can't afford to buy the third tablet on her own.

I am very much against the third tablet, but it sounds like she intends to gift the younger 2 their tablets anyway and a third tablet for the oldest might be the only way to make sure his siblings could have theirs in peace, but I am really not okay with buying a third one just for it to be broken.

1,"AITA for 'stealing' my Dad's business idea and making a success of it? | Title says it all really. 

I (26M) technically ''stole'' my dad's business idea. When I first heard it from him, it was so simple yet so...genius. I can't say exactly what it is here, but it was genius. 

The thing is, me and my dad (55M) are complete opposites. He's the more introverted and quiet type. He's always been *very* intelligent, but he's lacked the ability to *get things done.* 

I've been told I'm more like my grandad (75M, my dad's dad). Physically, I look more like my grandad, but personality wise, I guess I'm a bit more impulsive and hot headed and not as intelligent as my dad, but I get things done. Perhaps I'm more ''traditional masculine'' than my dad. Its like I should be in the older generation, and he should be from the newer one.

When I heard my Dad's business idea, I was amazed, but I didn't truly believe my Dad could pull it off. He doesn't get things done. He's always been full of great ideas, but ideas not put to use are useless. 

So I took the idea and ran with it. I got IP rights and started the business with it 2 years ago. Since then, its been a massive success. Not millions or anything, but into the six figures and the potential to make millions is there perhaps in the next half decade if things keep going well.

My dad was very upset when I did this, but didn't say much. I could tell by his facial expressions. My mom (55F) said I've done her proud and done the right thing.

Well I confronted my dad yesterday to ask him how he feels and he said I'm a ''fucking asshole''. He said he felt betrayed by me and nearly started crying. I told him straight, ''You've always been a man of ideas, but I'm a man of action''. 

Then my sister (28F) walks in and starts saying shit to me, defending my dad. Both my mom and granddad have taken my side. I even offered my dad 20% of all profits, but he rejected and told me to get out.

We've had some problems with these apps displaying our restaurant withhigh delivery times because the delivery drivers / bikers (not our employees) are slow, slack off, and in one case, never delivered the food. It's not fair for our business to be penalized for their bad behavior so we'll mark the orders as delivered as soon as we hand the food off to the drivers.

Last night I had a customer call me up and demand to know where his food was. He had placed the order an hour earlier (a bit long but not unreasonable) but was very insistent that I explain to him why his food was marked as delivered when it hadn't arrived yet. I've found that explaining things to customers doesn't really help, so I calmly reassured him that the delivery guy already has the food and he was on his way. He asked several more times and I gave him the same answer.

That's when he threatened me. He told me that if the food wasn't delivered to his door int he next fifteen minutes that he would 1. report us to GrubHub and 2. backcharge us for the food and the tip.

A long while ago, an ex-girlfriend of mine, say 'Sarah', and I had a very tumultuous relationship. We were on and off, but eventually while together I found out she started cheating on me with a guy she lied about for years.

I believe she's otherwise a good person. We just weren't right for each other and she handled it very poorly. I had handled other aspects of our relationship poorly; I'm no saint. We've worked hard to re-forge a friendship and it's gone pretty well all things considered. She's made immense strides as a person and has earnestly apologized to me for the past.

Her birthday was this weekend and is incredibly important to her, so she came to visit me and we went out together to have some fun. Currently, her boyfriend, say 'Henry', is in jail right now for a victimless crime, so he's unavailable. Of course if Henry weren't in jail, they'd be spending the day together. That's fine and obvious.

What's bothering me is that he calls her from jail to ""thank"" me for taking her out on her birthday. She and I got into a very brief argument about this. She thinks this is a kind and thoughtful thing for him to say, and I think it's very insulting to both her and myself. My reasoning is as follows:

1) She's my friend, I don't need his permission or thanks to go have fun with her on her birthday, or any occasion for that matter.

2) Her and her birthday celebration is not a responsibility to just be handed off when he goes to jail. She is not an object. I took her out because I enjoy her company and recognize she loves her birthday, not because I was ""covering"" for him. I'm not his subordinate for when he's not around.

3) His ""thanks"" implies a statement that I'm a convenience for when he's not around. I don't like being treated as if I'm only worth hanging out with when he's not around. I think I'm worth more than that.

She disagrees with me and thinks I'm over-reading. It sounds like a trivial point, but I don't think it is.

1,"AITA for telling a customer I was on break instead of answering her (supposedly) simple question? | I'm pretty freaking bummed about this because I have a good job that's easy, walking distance of my apartment and has a union. I am on a probationary period and because I got written up I could get fired. I guess I need some input if I was in the wrong or not. 

I am a cashier at a grocery store. This morning another cashier ended up calling in sick so I handled the morning rush by myself. It wasn't brutal but I didn't get a chance to go to the bathroom the entire time. My manager was also late relieving me so I finally flagged him down, we had a quick conversation and he said he was sorry but please take a 15 minute break and come back. I was like cool. 

As I was walking through the store, a woman (I won't describe her because that sub was banned a few years ago) stopped me and asked me if I knew where the Cadbury Cream eggs were? I found this crazy because literally right behind me it looked like an easter rabbit had vomited pastel all over that corner of the store so I got the impression that she wasn't really even looking. I told her I was sorry I was on break and walked away. 

Before people jump to YTA I need to explain something about the last appx 30 days I've worked at this store. I've found that a simple question, especially when confronted on the floor like that, is never one question nor is it simple. I had to pee so bad that I didn't want to get into a long drawn out conversation that I've gotten into in the past. 

Not five minutes later my manager came flying into the breakroom and told me I was being written up for being rude to customers. I explained I was on break and hadn't had one since 5:30AM (it was about 9:45) he told me it didn't matter and the ""customer is always"" right. I told him I really had to go to the bathroom. Then he wrote me up for arguing with him. I told him I wasn't arguing I was explaining. He told me I was a toenail away from getting a third write up which would have me fired immediately and that my choices weren't boding well for my future at the company. I really, really need this job.

1,"AITA for putting my foot down with regards to my debt situation with my fiancé? | For some background, I'm 24f, and my fiancé is 28m. We've been dating for around 3 years, and we met at a yoga class I taught.

My fiancé comes from amazing wealth (compared to my family at least), and for some context, his family owns several million dollar homes, including a couple that he technically owns.

He's really been cagey about only one thing (and we're nearly perfect on everything else), which is paying off my student loans. Due to some poor choices on my end, I ended up with nearly $100,000 in debt which is a huge burden for me to carry.

Given the circumstances and the ridiculous rates I have to pay, not to mention its effect on my credit score and upward mobility from a career perspective, we've largely agreed that he'll pay things off once we settle down which is his family's way of telling us to get married.

With the wedding less than 3 months away, he's getting cold feet. His dad is fine, but he doesn't want to go behind my fiancé's back. I'm aghast and indignant that he's suddenly pulling out of something we'd talked about. And it worries me about the future where in marriage, he's going to be strict with *his* money and *my* money which is not what I have in mind. Given his family's wealth, I will be signing a pre-nup of sorts, and have spoken to a family friend who is a lawyer who agrees that it's not an onerous thing. With all of that down, I'm disappointed and hurt to see him go back on his word. 

I want to put my foot down and insist on this before we get married. I want him to follow through or at least setup a payment plan in the next few months. In all the stress of wedding planning, he's conveniently pushing away this conversation, which is his way of avoiding it. I wonder how things will be after marriage, and this is something I don't want to think about. What should I do? Am I the asshole if he's the one who backed off on a promise that means a lot to me and helps me immensely in my career and work/life situation?",False,False
1,"AITA for letting my daughter have friends at my stepdaughters birthday party | My daughter is 12, my step daughter is 7. My daughter is with her mom most of the time, so I like her time with me to be special. Her visit this time coincided with my step daughters birthday, so she was going to be there for the party. 

My wife told my daughter she could invite one friend to the party so she had someone to hang out with. However, like most 12 year olds, my daughter struggled to choose which friend to invite. She told me that she was worried that some friends would get angry if they weren’t invited. I told her just to invite her whole friend group to make it easier.

I thought the older kids would do their own thing at the party, but they wanted to participate. There were more younger kids, but the older kids were definitely more talkative and just did more. After the party, my wife raged at me for inviting more 12 year olds without consulting her and for “letting my daughter take over her daughters party.” I pointed out that I want my daughter to feel welcome and happy when visiting and I never want her to have social struggles because of anything going on. I also planned the party with my wife so I don’t think I should have to consult her about some changes. She accused me of favoritism but I feel like she’s playing favorites.

1,"AITA for mentioning that I had a chronic toothache while my wife was in labor? | I’m posting this from my wife’s account and both perspectives are included. I, the husband, am asking if I’m the asshole. 

This is a topic we’ve been debating for the past almost two years now. It’d be great to get some outside perspective and judgement. 

My perspective (husband):

My wife went into labor three weeks early so somewhat unexpectedly. Over the prior couple months I had started developing an intermittent toothache. About two or three hours into the 19 hour labor, I probably ate something delicious. 

After eating something delicious, I can’t quite remember what it was, my tooth started hurting in an ungodly way. I’m talking sharp, eye-watering pain. Her contractions at this point were very far apart, and she was in very little discomfort. 

Over the next couple of hours the toothache became a competing topic of conversation with the imminent birth of our first child.  I didn’t want to leave her side to look for medicine until her parents arrived. 

Once they arrived, to my surprise I was able to find an oral numbing medication at the hospital convenience store. That with a couple Excedrin was able to alleviate the pain just as my wife’s contractions started to pick up. 

Am I the asshole for discussing my mouth pain during her labor?

Wife’s perspective:

My husband had been complaining about a toothache for months and months throughout my first pregnancy. It kept getting worse, and every time he’d complain I’d say he should go to the dentist, but he refused. 

So as he mentioned, as I was in labor he started to once again complain about this tooth pain. Granted I wasn’t in terrible pain, but for a few hours while I was in the hospital getting ready to push a child out of my body he continued to complain frequently about his toothache. 

I did feel bad he was uncomfortable, but I had asked him multiple times to get it checked out, and there were other things at the moment I felt I should be focusing on. 

I’d like to also mention it wasn’t just he mentioned once or twice his tooth was hurting, this dominated the conversation for probably a couple hours.

I remembered that I had a bunch of old magic stuff in the attic that I used to practice with when I was younger. So I went to my aunt and uncle and said that I'd be happy to put on a little magic show and they said yes and thanked me. I didn't have a lot of time to prepare so by the time of the party, I put on the worst show in the history of magic. I got too confident with my memory and forgot more than half of the tricks I pulled. I was really awkward the whole time and tried cracking a bunch of jokes that didn't go over well with the audience of children. This wasn't like funny awkward, this was like terrible awkward. The only trick that worked was a ""magic coloring book"" which some kid in the audience spoiled for everyone else.

1,"AITA for not giving some of my payout to my unemployed parents? | Here we go. I (21F) study computer science at university. Awhile ago, I built an app and made a good chunk of money (about 70k, being purposefully vague about the details). My parents were paying my tuition and expenses for college, but I took over for them when I got the money. Full disclosure: they had paid about 60k in college expenses at this point). 

Well, the pandemic economy has hit my dads company hard, and he unfortunately had his position cut. My mom should have a job to go back to when all this is over, but they are obviously hurting for money right now. 

My mom called me yesterday and said that my dad was too proud to ask, but they are really hurting for money. Their savings were decimated by a medical bill a few months back, and the remainder + unemployment are barely enough to pay the mortgage and other sundry. They’ll supposedly be out of cash by June. I told her I’d think about it and give her an answer by Monday.

I don’t think I’m going to give her the money. This cash is supposed to be for my future and I earned it through hard work. Next year tuition and living expenses will almost decimate the money I’ve earned. My mom has subtly referenced the fact that they paid for my first three years of tuition and I have an ability to help them. But I’m still basically a kid and they are adults with the ability to work and plenty of nice things to sell if needed.

1,"WIBTA if I don't tell about a financial aid to my wife's cousin? | (Throwaway because wife knows about my main account)

Background: my wife is pregnant, her cousin (C) had a baby 2 months ago. The C and her husband (H) have loans for everything. Cars (2), bike, jewels, TV and other things like that and they keep crying about how their life is so difficult because they have so much bills to pay but in fact they just don't know how to manage their money. Besides that they keep apart of our family, never inviting anyone to their house (recently they moved and didn't told anyone) and everytime they are invited to someone's house, they go but look angry and don't talk to anyone (Last time that I invited them, they didn't say hello and goodbye to me)

Now my doubt. Once I knew that my wife was pregnant started to work 2 jobs because her health is not the great and has to be at home all 9 months and recently find out that the government of our country has a financial aid to pregnant mom's and have another to the baby once she is born. We applied and got the financial aid. Now, my wife wants to tell her cousin about baby's financial aid but I just don't want to tell them this because I think they are ingrateful and only think about themself and probably they would use the aid to keep buy stupid things instead buying stuff for their baby.

1,"AITA for getting upset with my mother and sister about getting gifts for my Fiancee, when she's explicitly asked to get nothing? | So, my fiancee(F/28, if that matters) is of the sustainable mindset. She also gets serious anxiety when people give her Christmas gifts, as though there should be some sort of reciprocity. Instead of gifts, she has asked this year that people take time to learn something new, donate to charity, read about mental illnesses, and other sustainable options. The closest she has offered to getting gifts is smart consumables(e-gift cards, non-plastic wrapped items, time with people). A lot of the people I've talked to totally understand this and are behind alternative options. 

Now, here's where I'm struggling. My mother and sister are VERY STRONG in their love language of Gifts. Each year, we make an Amazon wish list and get a few things for each other so that it is things we would like to receive. It works for us. I talked to both of them and explained the situation. After talking with my sister about it from my understanding, she seemed to be set on getting me gifts(which is fine) and an e-gift-card to Lowe's for my fiancee(we are renovating our house, so it made perfect sense). I left it at that for a few weeks.

We had our gift exchange at Thanksgiving. I understood that I would be getting gifts, but when my sister came forward with gifts for my fiancee, I told her that they likely would not be accepted. Sure enough, my fiancee(who was out of town) did not take them as they were things she wouldn't use and they weren't what she asked for. I blew up to my mom and my sister, telling them both that they needed to find a way to get gifts that my fiancee would want. If we are going to go so far as to ask for things from each other and be expected to get some of the requested items, why couldn't they do the same for this new addition to the family? 

The result of that was my sister telling me that I was a jerk for not understanding that she likes to give gifts, and my mother backing her with the same idea. To which I responded that it will be very hard to get my fiancee to any future Christmas celebrations, which I would hate. I don't want to have to ""lay down the law"", and I don't want to be the mediator here. I plan to spend my life with this woman and I don't want her feeling uncomfortable at family holiday gatherings.

1,"AITA for asking parents if they having more kids? | Whenever I'm talking to someone and they have kids I will usually use that as a conversation filler.

Me: Hey, how have yall been?

Them: great, and yourself.

Me: So how old are your kiddos

Them: 2 and 5

Me: Cool, I have a 3 and 6 year myself. Do you plan on having anymore or is two enough?

The question is worded differently depending on how many kids that have, if they have all boys or girls, etc. The gist of the question is the same though. **Are you having more kids?**

My wife informed me last night that asking that question is rude and it's too personal. I've asked this question to at least 20 different people over the past few years and I've never sensed any awkwardness or felt it was too personal. It seems like a harmless question to me, but maybe it isn't? She says I don't know their situation so it's best to just not ask.

A bit of background, basically my ‘mum’ adopted me when I was 10 she was my dads partner who has been in my life and treated me as her own since I was 1 so I don’t know a life without her, My dad was abusive towards her so she adopted me in order to get full custody when my dad was sent to prison and they separated. Me and my partner ‘James’. have been together for multiple years and already have one child a boy called ‘Noah James smith’.


Now onto the story I fell pregnant for a second time and we found out we was having a girl which was what we wanted and my partner said we should make her middle name my mums name so we decide her name would be ‘Maisie Mary smith’. When we told James mum we was having a girl she naturally asked about the name so we told her and her whole attitude changed she eventually admitted that she’s the child’s real grandmother so she thought we’d name her after her, so ‘Maisie Maria smith’ now this pissed me off because although my mum isn’t related by blood she’s been an amazing mum and an amazing grandmother to our little boy. 


This has caused arguments between James and his mum as she won’t let it go that we hadn’t chosen her, she thinks it’s disrespectful and that we don’t want her involvement in our children’s lives which just isn’t true at all. Because of all of this arguing and his mother’s initial reaction James has came to me and said that he thinks we should just change the name to his mothers name to keep the peace I don’t think this is fair on my mum and I don’t think we should be guilt tripped into changing our child’s name so I’ve refused and even went as far to say that our first child has his name so his family have already been recognised and they’ll both also have his family’s surname so it’s only right that at some point my family is recognised this has caused argument between James and myself.

I have very ""ethnic"" hair despite not looking like a member of a specific ethnic group. I didn't have decent haircare advice or knowledge until adulthood. My adoptive mother tried the ""take the kid to the salon for advice"" route, but because she only used white salons, there was no good advice to be found.

No, and I repeat no, white hairdresser can do my hair. I've tried stylists at every professional level. None of them can do it. I now go only to salons staffed by a very specific ethnic group for my hair cutting and styling needs. In my state, there are only two options. In bride's state, there are none. 

Every single time, white people think the answer for straightening or curling my hair is to add more heat. This is incorrect, and will just burn my hair. So I use this question as a litmus test for if a stylist is good or not. The bride's stylist answered wrong, so I'm not using her.

The bride wants everyone to have curled hair, and all her stylist will be able to do is ruin my hair, not achieve what the bride wants, and make everyone feel bad.

1,"AITA for letting trash and dishes pile up in our dorm room? | At the beginning of the year when I met my roommate, I told her that I enjoy tidying up and cleaning, and that I would do most of it. She was obviously excited about that, the only thing I DID ask her to do was take out the trash, because I’m so bad at remembering to do it when I’m in a hurry for classes. The first few weeks she took out the trash, but after that, she stopped. There would be at least four trash bags sitting by the door waiting to be taken out and she would just ignore them. 
I like having a clean area, but my roommate would not mind living in filth. I always tidy up the room, and sometimes it will stay a little bit messy if I’m busy or stressed, but I always get around to it. I also have a lot of dishes that pile up in our sink, mainly because I hate doing dishes and I do them when I’m completely out of dishes and I absolutely have to. She never offers to help with cleaning, and says to her friends that she doesn’t even use the dishes here, which is partly true. She uses them very rarely, and recently she’s started using them more. She does not wash them. 
I deep cleaned our bathroom yesterday which was FILTHY while she and her boyfriend just lounged around. Right now there are four trash bags stacked up against the wall, and she always makes a stink about having a trash bag for recycling too. (Yet she never even takes any trash out!) 
She only ever takes out the trash if I ask, and even then she makes me feel weird when I ask (body language, facial expression) as if I’m acting like a mom and making her do a chore. 
I’ve tried before to just continue to let trash pile up and it took 1. A horrible smell to start accumulating and 2. At least six trash bags and some big amazon boxes for her to actually take it out herself. And even then she only took one trash bag. 
She and her boyfriend also leave trash everywhere, and there have been a few times where I accidentally threw something out that someone wasn’t “finished with yet” 
I just feel like if she’s going to sit there and literally watch me clean the room, and if I’m the one who’s providing a clean living space for her, the least she could do is take out the trash or pitch in with the dishes here and there.

It hurt so bad right at first, and there is probably going to be more pain as I deal with it, but at least this way I’ll actually move on and not do the same thing to myself that she was doing to herself that created this situation in the first place

THEM: I think the lesson is to be careful about getting invested too quickly, especially before you’ve talked about what you’re looking for

ME: I’d rather not have anyone trying to tell me lessons to take from this.

Please don’t try to preach to me about how to handle these types of things again. If I want advice rather than an ear to vent to, I will ask for it.

THEM: 😅 nvm I guess, back to the poly stuff (what everyone else was talking about while we talked about this)

ME: I don’t mean to go off 😂 I just know where I’m at the process that went into the choices that I made in a way that you don’t because I haven’t posted enough context on this server for any of y’all to, and getting told what I should take from this by someone that does have that full context just rubs me the wrong way, especially while I’m still in this painful place about it. No worries though 😊😊

THEM: I was trying to help bc that’s what I did with the girl I liked before this one, and especially because no one else answered your message.

Now when I’m walking up to the coffee shop, I recognize her sitting on the outside chairs on her phone but she doesn’t see me. I could hardly believe that it was the same girl that I matched with because she was wayyyy more heavy than she looked in her profile pic. And I don’t mean just a little bit thick, I wouldn’t mind that, but she was borderline obese looking like a mountain. So I kinda froze not knowing what to do then just panicked and walked away. I blocked her before she could text me anything and just went home annoyed at the waste of time. My friend laughed when I told him the story and said I was dick, but honestly I think she’s the asshole for trying to catfish me and wasting my time. Yea I know ghosting is an asshole move and really hurts the person, and that would be true in any other circumstance if I told her that I would meet up with her but had no intention of doing so. But I did have the intention to go and I did go. The only reason I left is because she wasn’t being honest with me and portrayed herself as someone else, likely knowing that I wouldn’t have talked to her if I really saw her. So who’s the asshole here? Me for leaving the date with someone I barely recognized or her for trying to deceive me about her looks, wasting my time and gas only to find out she’s a catfish to my disappointment?",False,False
1,"AITA for not asking permission at work to attend family wedding? | I've been with the company for over 13 years. Hard worker, never makes a fuss. Do my job, help out extra nights and weekends when needed. Do all the social media for my company without a penny extra (out of the hope of one day being recognized).

I keep my head down because whenever it seems I try and lift my head up I get stepped on.  People take long lunches, dress casual, take advantage.  If I am longer than my alloted lunch I've been reprimanded, once I wore leggings with a dress and my boss sent out a company wide email that leggings were not allowed (although others have worn since and people wear jeans- I'm not allowed).  I am white, my coworkers are not.

My coworkers have taken 3 weeks and 2 week vacations with no trouble.I stick to a week and a half even tho I am given 23 days. I don't want to step out of line and ruffle feathers.

Anyways...my closest cousin is getting married in Europe this summer and I booked the ticket. I told my boss today. She said its not approved and I can't take off that much time.  Ticket is non-refundable, nope too bad.

I am so furious I want to quit. I know thats not rational because I have bills and family that I can't go without a solid paycheck for too long.

My parents think I'm the asshole because I didn't ask permission.  My co-worker thinks they are being unfair to me because she was allowed to take two 2 week vacations.",False,False
0,"AITA for reporting a Lyft driver for asking for my number? | I got into a bad collision Saturday night and I’m still waiting to hear if it’s totaled or not. I’be been really stressed out about how I’ll get to school, work, and appointments until it’s fixed. At the time I was also thinking about how I can’t afford my coachella hotel and pay my deductible plus Lyft rides to get around. Thank god it’s postponed now... On top of that I’m feeling a little stiff.

You guys get the picture: I was in a bad mood the following day of the accident.

I call a Lyft after work. The driver starts the small talk. “How are you” “this is where you work” “do you like your work” “I’m in accounting but I just do this on the side”. I was being short because i didn’t want to talk and figured he would get the memo. Finally I politely said “hey man I’m having a rough day and I just need time to myself right now”

Now you’d think he would just stop right? Wrong. “Ohhhh bad day?? Sometimes we have bad days but then we have better days” then he continued to go on saying similar things. I’m just sitting there looking out the window as he keeps talking. He asked me more questions about work, and I started feeling like he was trying to pitch something to me. He was basically forcing me to answer his questions about work because when I was would ignore him he would turn around like he was waiting.

He asks me what’re my days off and what’s my phone number and I just snapped. Basically said how he’s being inappropriate and making me uncomfortable when I’m having a bad day.

AITA for reporting him to lyft? I don’t know if he asked for my info to be flirty but he definitely was making me uncomfortable.",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting to call my stepdad ‘dad’ but also expecting him to call me his daughter? | I’m 22 years old, and I’ve known my stepdad my entire life. I’ve also known my bio dad my entire life. I love them both very much, and I’m lucky in that they love me very much. 

My mom had 2 kids, my older brother and me. My dad had PTSD from being in the military so he would disappear a lot growing up. My mom married my stepdad who came into my life around 4, and he is also from a military background. Weirdly, my stepdad and dad get on but I’ve always drawn a clear distinction that 1 is my ‘dad’ and 1 isnt. 

My older brother on the other hand calls them both dad, and he is super close to my stepdad. Sometimes it makes me angry because my brother would rather do things with my stepdad than our actual dad and my stepdad always seems to be ‘closer’ to him than me. He will always introduce my bro as his son wherever they go. 

Now me on the other hand,  I made it clear when I was 14-15 that I would ONLY call my stepdad ‘stepdad’. He accepts that but in return I feel like he isn’t as close to me. He buys me stuff, texts me memes, etc, but he also calls me his stepdaughter and that pisses me off. Like. You’re the one who raised me and you’re the parent. Call me your daughter or don’t you care that much?

I spoke to my mom regarding this and she said that my stepdad is trying to maintain the boundary that I asked for and that it isn’t fair for me to deny him being called a dad because he put me through college etc but expect that he calls me his daughter. She told me it’s all in my head that he isn’t as close to me because he loves me very much.

1,"AITA for not accepting my roommates compromise of my boyfriend coming over to spend the night once a week? | For background: Ive been living with my roommate in a 2 bd 2 bth for 1 month now. Before we moved in we discussed my boyfriend and I did say he would be spending the night some nights. She accepted it.

Ok. So, yesterday my roommate texted me and asked me if my boyfriend spending the weekend with me is going to be a weekly thing, I said yes. She proceeded to tell me her issues with that and due to “past roommates” she doesn’t feel comfortable with him spending the nights with me on the weekend because she wants to fully relax on the weekend but “cant” because theres a man in the apartment (She didn’t go into full detail about what happened with her past roomies) 

The problem is, Im a full time student, and my boyfriend works full time Mon-Fri, and we both live an hour away from each other. So obviously, Friday night- Sunday afternoon is an ideal situation for us to spend time together. 

I don’t want to compromise with her because there really isn’t any comprising that can be done besides, “don’t bring him over every week,” which I don’t feel comfortable with, since I am paying rent, and I am a grown woman.

Granted, as a woman, I can understand her uncomfortableness at a certain degree, like if my boyfriend was just roaming around the apartment. Using our stuff, or being in the common areas, but he’s NOT. 

My boyfriend stays in my room the whole time he stays with me, unless he uses my bathroom which is right across my room so its a 2 second walk outside my room. My boyfriend doesn’t go in the kitchen what so ever, or anywhere besides my bedroom. The only time my roommate has seen my boyfriend was when she was moving her things in the beginning of the month, so he could introduce himself. Im also very courteous of her as we are very quiet in my room, we have tried everything to do to accommodate to her.

So, AITA for not accepting her compromise and her point of view? 

TLDR; roomie feels uncomfortable with boyfriend spending weekend with me in my bedroom but shes never seen him, or heard him, his “presence,” makes her uncomfortable.",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I report my neighbor to our landlord? | I am having a conundrum lately. I live in an apartment building and our neighbor across the hall is becoming slightly problematic. I mean, he seems to be a nice older gentleman and all, but he doesn't seem too keen on keeping things tidy or clean. 

I wouldn't be considering the complaint, but this man lives in a pile of absolute garbage. He enlisted the help of my husband recently to take some trash out (which is fine), but my husband says that he went into the apartment and it was piled from floor to ceiling with trash. There were rotting containers of meat on the counters. Four of the bags my husband helped take out were full of used cat litter and apparently the cats have just been going anywhere and everywhere in this man's apartment. It is disgusting. 

Every few weeks, there will be an abominable stench in the hall outside the apartments. It is so bad that we have to plug our noses when we leave. We have a terrible fruit fly infestation now, which is crazy since we make sure our apartment is clean and we rarely leave fruit out in the open. 

I am considering reporting the situation, but I don't want to come off as though I have anything against this guy himself. I just have issues with how his mess is affecting our comfort in our own home. I would hope that maybe they could look into what is going on.

1,"AITA for losing my shit at my Dad when we were having an extended family dinner? | &#x200B;

 We were having a farewell dinner with my aunt and uncle because I'll be flying to the UK to start University. Because I don't have much time left in the country I brought up the issue of me getting a replacement phone. I'm not the type of guy who needs to have a new phone every year. I'm only asking to change my phone now because for the past 3 months I going from fully charged to 50% in 5 minutes. I brought this to my parent's attention 2.5 months ago so I wasn't exactly springing a trap on them. We discussed it a bit with my uncle and aunt but eventually they agreed to get it for me as an early birthday present and everything was good.

Then my Dad started to bring up issues like how I need to study hard in school and not waste my life away. I'd be completely fine if it wasn't the 32nd time in the past week. To give you an idea of the kind of people they've been acting like recently: they reminded me that I had to go out shopping to buy winter clothes for the UK as I won't be used to the cold weather. Fair enough. This was 4 months ago btw. There was a discount going on at a local clothing store this month so naturally I didn't stock up right away. For 3 months straight at least once every 2 days they would come in and ""remind"" me to go stock up on winter clothes. It's more like a lecture on how i need to be responsible when I tell them that I'm waiting for a sale every time.

As you can probably guess, this dinner wasn't the first time they brought up the issue of me studying hard overseas. I'll admit, after hearing the same shit come out of my Dad's mouth for the 10000th time over the course of the last year I got a bit pissed off and told him to drop. Nothing vulgar and rude. Just a simple: ""That's enough. We've had this conversation before I'm sick of listening to the same thing over and over again when I can't do anything about it"". Cue him flying off the handle talking about how I don't appreciate the good life I'm living now etc.

But this isn't even the worse part. The worst part is that after he got mad in the restaurant he said ""you know what, you can forget about your new phone"". This is when I blew up. The reason i got so mad is because like everything else, this isn't the first time he's pulled some similar shit. It's always the classic ""I promised you something but now i'm going to create a situation where you're rude to me so I can now use this as an excuse to back out of my promise"". When I was 5 it was a deck of Pokemon cards that I really wanted. When I was 8 it was a Moleskin calendar notebook, at 13 it was a football jersey, at 14 it was a wallet and then later a pair of headphones, at 16 an eggbeater so that I could cook for whoever came to the house for dinner. There are probably many more that I can't remember. Well this time he got out of the chair to leave the dinner half way and tried to create a scene in front of my family. So I kind of lost my shit and called him a ""15 year old in an adult's body man child"". AITA?",False,False
1,"WIBTA for only paying for university of my children if I find their programs have merit? | I'm 47F, husband is 49M. We have three children: Jack, 26M; Jane, 23F; and Jill 19F.

When Jack went to university, he applied for grants and we paid the remainder. He graduated with no debt. Likewise when Jane went, the same situation applied. Jack went for chemistry, Jane went for kinesiology. Jill finished highschool and took a gap year and is looking to start in January.

We paid for Jack and Jane's school because university here in Ontario is relatively cheap after you account for grants. It's something like $5,000 tuition per year, but they both received anywhere from $3,500 to $4,000 per year in grants and bursaries, with the remainder being loans. Some of these grants were based on academics, but the majority is based on income and other factors. It's very cheap to go to school here because these grants are available to everyone, basically.

But we also paid for them because both my husband and I found their program choices have merit and real world applications. And we were right: Jack went on into pharmacology and makes a pretty penny, Jane got a job right out of school in sports management.

Jill wants to go double majoring in gender studies and asian culture studies. We don't want to pay for it because we think it has little merit and she'll have difficulty finding a job. Why? Some of my friends went for gender studies or sociology or anthropology when I was in school and none of them work in related fields. Some of them don't even work and are SAHMs and didn't work inbetween school and becoming SAHMs. Nothing against SAHMs but Jill claims she is career oriented and thinks this will be her career when both my husband and I don't think it'll work out.

She already got quotes for her government grants/loans and her final cost is going to be only $1,500/yr or so. She lives at home: this is something she can reasonably pay off saving a little here and there in just a couple of months. If she was determined, she could pay off her yearly loans in a single month. Even at a minimum wage job.

We want her to have the experience of having to work for school so she can rethink her major. If she has to work to go to school, she'll realize it's not as simple as she thinks and she'll become more interested in a major that can actually make her some money.

1,"WIBTA if I insist on my dream wedding? | Recently my [M30] girlfriend [F30] proposed to me. Though we had not discussed a timeline for getting married, we both had it in mind as something that we would do relatively soon and I was planning to ask her pretty soon (within months).

I wasn't thrilled that she did this, but I could tell she was very excited and she went to some trouble so I didn't make an issue of it. I accepted, and joked, ""I guess I get to plan my dream wedding, since you proposed.""

She responded along the lines of ""Yeah, I guess you're right, haha!""

Later, I thought to myself, ""Wait, why shouldn't I have my dream wedding?""

My dream wedding is: Just the two of us, a judge, and a witness (if legally required). No reception, no hassle, no bullshit. We can't just have a very small ceremony because someone will undoubtedly feel left out. I think it's perfect.

My husband M(32) and I F(30) decided to rent out our master bedroom/bathroom six months ago due to my being laid off at work. We ended up with a F(24) roommate. 

When we were interviewing potential roommates she told us she works full time and she often spends the night at her boyfriends house and was looking mainly for a place to shower, do laundry and keep her stuff. There were other roommates who I liked better but my husband thought she was the best fit with not being home often and a reliable income. 

Since moving in we see even less of her than expected. Sometimes she doesn’t come home for days at a time, and when she does it’s usually for no more than a few hours. She’s only spent the night maybe once a week. I tried to talk to her at first, but she didn’t seem interested, so I gave up. I feel like she’s a stranger in my home, but my husband thinks it’s ideal and that we couldn’t of gotten a better roommate. 

Yesterday while my husband was at work and I was out doing grocery shopping, I came back to my roommates car in the driveway and an additional vehicle I’ve never seen before parked out front of our house. 

I entered my home and saw my roommate and who I assume is a friend of hers in the kitchen. There was a rolled up bill and a credit card out, and the whole thing seemed suspicious to me. They quickly left after I got home. 

I know I shouldn’t of done this, and realize it’s an invasion of privacy, but I went through my roommate’s room and found illegal drugs in her dresser drawer. 

I told my husband about it when he got home, and told him I want to give our roommate a 30 day notice. He told me I was being dramatic and that she’s an adult and good roommate, and that we won’t find anyone better. He also kept saying that we need the money.

This post reminded me of my situation so I decided to make my own. My dad used to be a partner at a law firm but retired. To spend time with him and to keep his mind sharp I have him look over contracts for me. So when I was signing everything for my apartment I had him look over the papers. Not a lot of people know this, but when people hand you contracts to sign, they are actually starting a negotiation and you can actually make amendments to the contract. For example, I'm exempt from the no-smoking rule, I can use the roof whenever I want as opposed to from(10-7) or with expressed permission and I can use the gym whenever I want. This all was going swimmingly until I decide to go to the gym after work. I'm doing my thing for about thirty minutes and then I was pleasantly surprised when a bunch of girls walked in. I just smiled and waved and went back to my business.  As I was leaving a girl side-barred me and said, ""I didn't want to interrupt you because I can tell your new but we actually have a lady's hours from 4-5"" I informed her that my rental agreement is slightly different from the standard one and that I'm exempt from that rule. I reassured her that I'll keep to myself. Apparently I did a bad job at reassuring her because I get a call from my landlord asking me to not use the gym during that time period. I told him that I won't go out of my way to go to the gym during lady hour but I won't go out of my way to avoid it either. He threaten to not renew my lease and I was like ""okay I wasn't going to renew my lease anyway"". I guess he realized that was all he could do and hasn't bothered me since. The boyfriend or husband of one of girls tried to intimidate me but I called his bluff and he hasn't bothered me since either. I have noticed lady hour being less popular which is unfortunate but ultimately not my problem, but a couple of the girls have warmed up to me and even invite me to work out with them occasionally too, so it isn't like I'm completely unwelcome but I still get the occasional death glare. I was reliving the whole idea to my family at family dinner. My dad thought the whole thing was hilarious but my sister thinks I'm TA because I'm making women feel uncomfortable.

1,"AITA: In Rocket League, I ask for the opposing team to give goals back when they are earned illegitimately, and if they refuse I report them for Unsportsmanlike Conduct. | So I play a lot of Rocket League- it's a fun game.  But it's also very competitive.  If you lose too often you rank down; if you win often you rank up.

In Rocket League, I'll often play 1v1s and 2v2s where if 1 player loses connection for a round or sees their ping go up above 150 ms, the game is basically unplayable.  In these games, the team to which this occurs suffers, particularly in 1v1.

To clarify, I have done everything in my power to try to keep a stable connection.  I have an ethernet cable to my router on broadband internet, and still I will occasionally experience ping greater than 500 ms and occasionally disconnect from games, leaving my teammates in a 1v2 situation for about 1 minute.

So eventually when my connection returns, I'll ask that the opposing teammates return the goals they illegitimately earned, as many games come down to 1 or 2 point leads.

More often than not, the opposing team refuses to give the goals back, saying ""It's competitive.  I need to rank up.""  And I'll respond with ""It's competitive.  I need to rank up.""  They'll often tell me to get a better connection, and I'll explain that I've done everything in my power to get a better connection.

If by the end of the game the opposing team hasn't returned the illegitimate goals to even the score, I report them for Unsportsmanlike Conduct, an offense that can get a player temporarily banned from the game if too many reports come in.

When I tell them I'm reporting them, they often report me back, saying I'm just crying that I lost, then report ME for Unsportsmanlike Conduct.

My fiancé and I have been together almost 2 years now, and pretty much since the beginning it has been a little rough around the edges in regards to my son. He was from a previous marriage, and she has a daughter from a previous relationship. She has said in multiple arguments/discussions that she won't care for him more than the minimum (because of a long message my ex wife sent and I tried for over a year to convince her otherwise) that she would ""pretend to love him and that I would never know the difference"", when I bring him over and she doesn't know about it she gets upset, when I check to make sure he can stay the night I sometimes get ""Not tonight, I just want to have a 'normal' night"". The most recent was just last Monday, when she told me that she treats my son differently strictly because I treat her daughter a little differently than I do my son. Now, to a certain extent I could understand that, but when you look at the situation it sounds petty. She has had her daughter since Day 1, I have only known her for 2 years. I have had my son since Day 1, and she has only known him for 2 years. There is almost no possible way that the 2 kids could be treated exactly the same (unless you're in a movie) in 2 years. I have brought this discussion up countless times, to no avail.

A few days ago, I brought it up again with some other things that had been bugging me (being taken for granted, doing literally all of the housework, not being appreciated for doing said housework) and suddenly something clicked. She seemed to see all of the things that I've mentioned for the entirety of our relationship in one short exchange of messages.

1,"AITA for reporting a restaurant manager about the treatment my family and I received? | This happened on my cousin's 21st birthday a couple of weeks ago, she goes to college up in Maryland and my brother and about 45 mins away in Virginia. We wanted to go out and treat her to some drinks after we got some dinner. 

So we went to a local bar restaurant to start the night and we wanted to grab some drinks, which is were the big problem started. My brother and I moved to VA about 7 years ago for college when we were 18 and got the state standard 'vertical' license for underage people which don't expire for another year, so I've never seen a reason to spend my whole day at the DMV. Additionally, before this night, we've NEVER had any issues due to the vertical license since anyone that takes a second to read can see that I'm actually well past legal drinking age. 

So we tried to grab a couple drinks at the bar, as we have now in several different areas in several states with no issue, and the bartender starts acting strangely by getting defensive by asking all 3 of us about our addresses, birthdays, etc. likely thinking they were fake (even though VA licenses are incredibly hard to fake). When we asked if there was an issue, he says ""hold on"" and takes our licenses away and goes off to talk to the manager. This was not only sketchy but I felt extremely disrespected as their customer. 

Afterward the manager comes over and is acting very defensive and very in a very aggressive manner comes over and says ""yeah, we're not going to accept these IDs since they're vertical"" when I asked why he said ""because we can't confirm you're over 21"" (again he could take 2 seconds to do some mental math) . When I asked what  he meant by this since I've gone to MD bars before without issue he said ""look we're not taking these ID's and if you aren't going to order I have to ask you to leave"" 

We obviously left since we were not going to sit there and be disrespected and have out legitimate IDs called fake by some dude too lazy to take 2 seconds to actually look at the dates. After we left, we were all understandably pissed off by this guy's attitude and we decided that since he was the manager, there was no one we could really complain to. I was pissed since he never gave us a chance to explain so I decided to get a bit of petty revenge and called the Alcohol Control Dept. and said that they were not ID'ing people and serving them, thinking at most they'd sweat him a bit with some questioning and maybe a surprise investigation. 

But we found out last week through the grapevine, that the restaurant has actually gotten caught several other times serving minors and their alc license has been permanently pulled for them.  

WITA in this scenario? The guy definitely needed a wake-up call for his shitty treatment and I feel I may have gone a bit far, but I don't really feel too bad since the manager clearly selectively applied the ID rule and clearly has no training in customer service.  ",False,False
0,"AITA for not apologising to my sisters boyfriend? | A little back story, so my sister has been dating this guy for over a year and they recently moved in together after she switched university's to be closer to him. Now from the very first time I met the bloke I said something was off about him, but I couldn't put my finger on it, it was just certain things he said and did that set alarm bells off in my head, But I kept my mouth shut because my sister loved him and she seemed happy.

Fast forward to two months ago and we are out on the town partying and having a good time while shes down for a long weekend with him. Everything is fine until we all sit down at the first pub and he cant sit next to her because our friend is, he starts pouting like a toddler and puts on this whiny voice about how ""they haven't been able to be together since being down here"" and ""it's not fair he cant sit next to her"" (which is bullshit as they shared a bed at my parents) she just rolls her eyes and tells him to sit next to me as he walks off to order the drinks. While hes gone she turns to me after seeing the look of disbelief on my face and says she wants to talk to me about that tomorrow.

Anyway the rest of the night goes well we are all laughing and having fun, until we end up at the club, we are all swapping between dancing and smoking when all of a sudden her bf is gone and my sister is crying, we all run over to her and she hugs my sobbing and explaining he stormed off after she wouldn't apologise for ""not looking at him enough while dancing"" accusing her of ""looking at other guys"" (we are in a gay bar filled with women 90% for reference to how stupid that is), I tell her he is being stupid and to not worry and enjoy the night without him, but this makes things worse and she breaks down admitting hes mentally abusive and that she cant handle it anymore and pulls out a list of stuff he does on a daily basis. At this point her phone is ringing non stop from him and she give it to me so she can ignore it after ten minutes of non stop ringing I pick it up, tell him shes gone i have her phone and to meet me so i can give it to him. This is where i fucked up. When I saw him I lost my cool, I marched over too him, said something along the lines of ""who the fuck to you think you are to abuse my little sister? You abusive cunt"" allot of calling him names, I dont remember the exact exchange but it ended with me not allowing him to see her, and him storming off. I didn't let him back into the house and he went back up country without my sister until she went back as planned a few days later. He and I have not spoken since.
 Now my sister wants me to apologise to him, but I dont think I did anything wrong.

When we found out it was a boy, i told him again i am still naming him sean, my boyfriend ignored my comment. For MONTHS any time he’s asked about deciding a name i tell him, i have my name. And every time he rolls his eyes and walks away. Cut to two days ago, i go in for my c section, after my little man came out, we spent time together and then came us filling out paperwork for his name. And like i said i would, i put sean, and since my boyfriend had already signed the paperwork/birth certificate, i signed it and i said “i put his name down” to my surprise my boyfriend looked at the paper and flipped his shit. He was yelling about how disrespectful i was for naming my son after my ex. I tell him, “i’ve told you even before we got pregnant i’m naming him sean.” he’s mad and i told him i could care less that he’s mad when i specified for MONTHS what his name would be.

We have been planning this date for 2months and I was excited! I got a nice skirt and got my hair done, I spent all day trying to look nice.

When he got home he told me he wouldn't go out with me because the skirt barely covered me and looked like a belt, I'll admit it was a short skirt but I had tights on and it did cover me up.

He got a beer and just started watching the TV, basically a sign ""*don't talk to me, I'm not going anywhere!*"" 

I've been friends with this specific friend for 9 years now, he's nice and usually my partner is quite friendly with him.

Infant care is crazy expensive, $2700 a month. We both have good jobs but we would still struggle with the full monthly payment so free daycare is a huge blessing. 

While I think my mother's offer is awesome I felt bad for attending her business where she pays employees for free. I decided that at the minimum we should pay $1000/month and I'm making my GF split it with me. She is very unhappy with my decision but is reluctantly going along with it.

1,"AITA for taking abandoned firewood? | Hey all. So a bit of backstory here, there used to be a nice house in my parents neighborhood. This house was bulldozed, leaving nothing but a vacant lot, some trees, and a large stash of firewood at the back of the fence. The lot itself is surrounded by a fence, but the gates that were once there have been completely removed.

5 years or so after the house has been gone, I am no longer living with my parents, and I am heading to go pick up some firewood from a local shop. It suddenly occurs to me to go and check that old vacant lot, it has been quite a while since I had been in the area, but yes, all the wood is still there. I kind of shrug mentally and drive in where the gate used to be, back up to the pile, and toss a few logs into my truck bed.

I finish up, and begin driving off. No sooner had I left the lot, when a black pickup truck pulls up next to me with his window rolled down, beckoning at me. I roll my window down too, not really sure what to expect. There is an older man and his wife in the other truck, and this exchange takes place;

Me: Yes sir?

Man: Did you just grab some logs from that lot over there?

Me: Oh, yes just a few.

Man: Well I'm going to have to ask you to put those back?

Me: Oh, I'm sorry! Do these belong to you? They have been sitting out here for at least 5 years so I wasn't sure if they belonged to anyone.

Man: Not me, but a friend of mine. I can call him up if you'd like.

Me: That's not necessary, I'm happy to put these back if they belong to somebody.

Man: Well, you better, because not only are you stealing, but you trespassed on private property.

Me: ...ok?

Man: Do you want me to call the police on you, son?

Me: I already said I would put the logs back, what else do you want from me?

Man: Well get on then!

So I start trying to turn around to get back into the lot, when he jumps out in front of me with a ""where do you think you're going?"" kind of look. I tried to explain that ""if you'll move out of the way I'll turn around and drive back in there."" But no dice, it's only good enough for him if I throw it into reverse and back into the lot. Ok fine, whatever, at this point I'm starting to get pretty angry because I feel like I've been nothing but compliant. So I back into the lot and unload the wood. He has the gall to not only follow me in there, but park in front of me so I can't leave, and then get out and inspect that all the wood was gone from my truck bed. There were so few pieces in there, that I was done before he even got out of his truck. After his inspection, he starts grilling me. Things like, ""Do you live around here, what's your name, what's your address, etc."" I was extremely uncomfortable answering these questions, so I gave him a bunch of fake information. Anyway, he's eventually satisfied and says ""I never want to see you around here again."" I just couldn't fathom how I could have possibly offended so much, and it still bothers me almost nine months later. So I have to ask, aita?",False,False

0,"WIBTA if I asked my parents to just leave me alone on my birthday? | Birthday is coming up soon. Still live with my parents (18F)My parents have a “New Years resolution” about losing weight, for like the 5th year in a row.  So far I am the only one losing weight out of the three of us. 

I don’t have a problem with their resolution. But because of that, they don’t want to go out anywhere or anything. I haven’t been with my parents to the movies for 8 years and I really wanted to go but my mom says that “it’s torture for her,” and my dad says “I need to lose weight including you.”

I told my dad that we don’t even have to get any food or drink and he still says no. They said we can have dinner tomorrow but they’re choosing a “healthy” place, which is a place I dislike and have told them before That I don’t like. I asked about sweets to which my dad tells me I’m fat and I don’t need it. A small piece of cake (we don’t get huge cakes, just the tiny slices) isn’t going to do anything. 

I already know I don’t get gifts for my birthday since it’s close to Christmas. I don’t care about material stuff or food or whatever. I’m just upset that my parents seem to just not want to hang out with me or do anything. I’m more upset about the movie stuff. My dad likes movies but doesn’t even want to go with me, even though my parents have been to the movies together (either didn’t tell me until after or told me right before they left) and I just feel kinda left out. I thought my birthday was going to finally be a day we can have fun and do things together but no because for my mom it’s “torture” and I need to “lose weight”.

1,"AITA for telling my mother I'm not going to my brothers wedding? | So I do want to start off by saying my brother an I have a decent relationship. We are less than 2 years apart and fought a lot as kids, but it was normal sibling arguments. Now that we are adults, our relationship has been much better. 

My brother had been dating a woman for 3 years and they got engaged. I found out via social media that he proposed. I was so excited for them, but so angry. I was hurt that he didnt tell me himself before posting it online. IMO its rude to not tell the people close to you important things like that first. He just said ""I can do whatever I want."" Fine. You can do what you want. 

Her mom threw them their engagement party, and her parents are paying for the destination wedding, and the bridal shower. They have a lot of money and my parents dont have much, so that's fine. But they havent included my mother in any of the wedding or event planning. They told her she could do the flowers for the shower (she used to be a florist) and that was it. My mother is very upset about being excluded from everything and my brother doesnt seem to care too much. 

After they booked the wedding, they chose their bridal parties. I guess I was kind of expecting to be included since I'm the only sibling between both families. His fiance has posted a bunch of photos and videos of her asking her friends to be bridesmaids, and I've seen them multiple times since. So at this point, everything is set and I'm bummed. At first I didnt think about it too much but yesterday it really got to me and I got upset. 

His fiance did tell me that they were renting a house for her bachelorette and that her MOH would text me info. But that's all I got.

I tried to bring it up to my mom and she brushes it off and uses my brothers recent health issues ad a few other things as excuses to not talk about the wedding stuff. As I said earlier, she gets upset and cries about not being included in plans. I got angry with her and told her that she needs to stop pushing this problem to the side, and she pretty much told me to fuck off. Ultimately I told her that I wasnt going to go to the wedding and didnt care if I already put a deposit down on the trip. She told me I was a horrible person and she hasnt talked to me since.

1,"AITA for wanting my step daughter to listen to me? | Posting through a throwaway account because people know my regular account

I got married to my husband Henry (name changed) a year ago and we've had a really good time. I dated him for two years before getting married to him and in that time he introduced me to Lola (name changed) who is his daughter. Lola seemed like a sweet girl, she was polite and we got along fine during the time Henry and I were dating but from the day she got engaged she has been very hostile to me. I married Henry after his previous wife cheated and ran away with someone and cut off all contact. We met about five years after that happened. Lola is 17 and still talks about her mother all the time and I understand why she would do that.

Back to the point, in the months leading up to our wedding I asked Lola to be one of my bridesmaids as I wanted to make our bond stronger. She agreed even though she didn't seem happy about it after Henry convinced her to become one. The wedding was alright but she sulked through the entire thing and ever since then she has been extremely cold to me.
Henry is 46 and I'm 22, we have a considerable age gap but I want to be a sort of support or motherly figure for Lola and she doesn't seem happy with it.

We all live together in the house that both Henry and I own and I've been trying to put some ground rules into place, nothing major, things like a designated study time for Lola and a balanced diet chart for everyone. Henry thinks what I'm doing is a good idea, his ex never really cared for anything and was rarely every at home. Both Henry and I work and while I'm at home I've been trying to talk to Lola and explain that things will be a bit different now that I'm married to Henry.
She refuses to eat the healthy food I've been making (I make salads and occasional foods of different cuisines and I'm a pretty good cook). 

She stays up all night texting or watching Netflix and won't wake up in the morning to go to school so I took away her phone and Henry thought I did the right thing but Lola threw her glass at the ground and broke it and I had to clean it up. 
I changed the family Netflix account password and she almost lost it

yesterday, she said she was going for the third party this week and I put my foot down and told her to go back to her room and study. She told me to fuck off and that I'm not her mother but Henry backed me up and told her that she wasn't going to another party. She screamed at me and slammed her door and hasn't come out of her room since.

Note as I said, the smell was STRONG. Up until then, she'd smoked outside, but at that point I was terrified that because of the smell I could have been implicated. I would come up clean if tested, but sometimes it doesn't even take that in a Right to Work state.

My rule is that everyone can get as drunk as they want, but they have to stay the night or have someone sober to take them home. No one is ever allowed to drive themselves home, I take people’s keys when they come in.

So people were over at my apartment to drink on Saturday night, and then at about 11pm this guy Ryan asked me for his keys because he wanted to go home. He said that he wasn’t drinking, he was just hanging out and playing video games. I was really drunk myself and didn’t actually see what Ryan was or wasn’t doing during the night, so I just told him that I wasn’t comfortable giving him the keys and that if he really needed to go home he’d have to figure something out. He argued with me for a little while and some of our friends also stuck up for him and said that he was obviously sober and I was being ridiculous. 

I ultimately had to play the “my house, my rules” card to get Ryan to call his roommate to take the train to my apartment. The roommate was dead sober so I gave him the keys. As soon as they got outside he just gave the keys to Ryan who then drove them both home. He’s still pissed off at me for making him call his roommate.

I knew that Sam and my other in-laws were sad to see them go, but were happy for them either way. We live a couple hours away from the boarder, so they can come visit whenever they want. 

Recently Jane became pregnant and Jon sent out a text to everyone. As Jon and Sam were talking to each other on the phone, I asked Jon if they were planning on coming back to America to officially start their family (I did not know Jane's official plan at the time). Then I heard some laughing in the background and asked if that was Jane. Jon said yes, I asked why she was laughing at my question, and Jane replied that she didn't want to start her family in (and theses are her words) ""a joke of a country."" I got really angry at her and told her to shut her mouth, took my husband's phone, and hung up on them. I'm not completely proud of taking my husband's phone like that, apologized to him, but I was still angry at what Jane said. So later that night, I texted her, demanding an apology and reminded her that while she did grow up in Canada, she was not born in Canada and had no true claim to Canada. 

Sam became very angry with me and Jane has blocked me on social media. I don't believe I have done anything wrong here, despite what my in-laws are telling me. I apologized to Sam for taking his phone, but everything else I don't see what I've done wrong. I simply asked for an apology and reminded Jane of what was true.

Also, for 2020, we wanted to increase her visit rate by $10.  So we put in an extra $10 in her envelope for the first visit in the new year and was going to tell her about the raise when she asked about it.  Cleaning day came and went, and she took the money and didn't send us any SMS mentioning the different amount in th envelope. 

To eliminate any doubts that she lost our number or other technical errors, we sent her an SMS asking to change the schedule slightly. She responded immediately, so it's not like she lost our number.

Now, my husband wants to find someone else because he thinks that an honest person would have told us about the extra $10. And a considerate person would have thanked us for the Christmas gift. I have my doubts- maybe she's angry at us because she think we're underpaying her, or maybe she's busy with something else during this busy season. But I don't understand why she wouldn't have acknowledged either the Christmas bonus nor the extra $10.

So, would I be the asshole if I stopped using her over not acknowledging these two things?",False,False
1,"AITA for not eating food served separately when it had been mixed thoroughly in a bowl? | My SO and I ordered vietnamese food and we ordered a plate of com tam. If you aren't familar with com tam, it is broken rice dish that is usually a protein, pickle carrots, cucumbers,  served on a plate separately, but on the same plate, very similarly to bibimbap in presentation. At fancier restaurants, the plating can be very elaborate. We had it sitting between us, and I had already taken a few bites. One of the reasons I like com tam is that, like bibimbap, I can eat each of the ingredients separately or together, and in different ratios, with each bite. I also don't like one part of the dish, which I didn't mention but have often in the past.

My SO, who just told me had never had com tam before, asked ""should I mix it up?"" to which I replied ""yeah, if you want"" thinking that meant trying different food together in different pairings. Soon, I would learn she was suggesting she should take a fork and stir the whole bowl, evenly distributing all the ingredients, and, in my opinion, ruining the deliciousness of the dish (and also making cold ingredients soggy). 

I laughed at first, almost confused as to why anyone would do this. SO tried to get me to eat it, and I declined. For reference, we had also ordered a Bahn Mi each, so I would rather eat that. 

So am I the asshole for not wanting to eat the food once it had been mixed together?",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my friend he probably isn't as smart as he thinks he is. | TLDR at bottom but maybe the details are important.

So for context me and this buddy of mine have been friends since middle school and we are 20 now so we have known each other for quite a while. He is a pretty smart dude in certain areas but almost every person has expertise in certain areas. 

He always ever since I met him thought pretty highly of his intelligence but in the past two months, every time we hang out he has been boasting about his ""intelligence"" for probably 10 percent of the time. So if we hang out for 2 hours he probably spends 10-15 minutes talking about how smart he is.

He often goes on tangents about ""how he doesn't see the world like the rest of the people, he sees potential in everything and it's like the world is feeding him information and he absorbs it and understands everything"" and how when he talks ""everything is lined up like a machine gun clip with precision and accurate articulation.""

He is also very determined that he is going to invent some sort of high tech weapon that has never been made before and he thinks he has the key to building it. While I think it would be cool I think he grossly underestimates the complexity of what he is trying to make.

He has also told me without ever taking an IQ test that he thinks his IQ is around 140-160 which is 1 in 400 people. And the average American has a 98 IQ. I'd say he is maybe 110 maybe 120 tops because I know a good handful of people smarter than him. He is super arrogant about his intelligence 

But then fast forward we are at my house playing Xbox and we were just roasting each other like all good friends do and he says to me as I'm a decently big guy (230lb 5,11) ""damn man, you got bigger boobs than most of the girls we graduated with"" and I said back a roast I saw from a r/roastme thread that stated ""if I ever wanted to kill myself I'd jump from your ego to your IQ"" and he got genuinely butthurt on how I insulted his ""genius mind"" and that ""I would never understand how smart he is"". And I said back ""your 20 working at a mall, haven't done anything yet to prove your smarter than 140 IQ and I frankly think you over estimate your IQ, your probably not as smart as you think you are buddy, I know intelligence is more than just an IQ but I highly doubt you have an IQ of 140-160""

AITA?

TLDR; friend often thinks of his intelligence and IQ superior than 99.75 percent of people (yes he thinks he is that smart) with no ever actual IQ test, the average in America is 98. While he thinks he is somewhere in the 140-160 range. I told him in a friendly roast session that I could jump from his ego to his IQ if I ever wanted to kill my self, he got offended and I told him he probably isn't as smart as he thinks he is because he just brags about his ""intelligence"" all the time",False,False

We came across a couple of my first wife and my kids were emotional upon seeing that. I hugged them and my son said he thought that pain went away but seeing one particular picture brought everything back. I told him that I understood and sometimes feel that way too. My 22 year old said he feels that way sometimes too and then feels guilty because he loves our family and we wouldn't have this family if his biological father was still around. Later that night my 16 year old asked if I loved my first wife more than her mom. I told her that love doesn't work that way. You can't compare the two. She said, ""Well like Landon said, if she never died you would have never had us. Would you rather that?"" I told her I couldn't answer that. I am happy with how my life turned out but there is no telling how my life would have turned out if I didn't lose my first wife. I said, ""Look. I am lucky enough to have fallen madly in love twice. Plenty of people go their whole lives without ever having that feeling and I had it twice. I count my blessings and try not to think about alternate timelines.""

1,"AITA for not wanting to attend my great aunt's funeral? | So today I came home from college (Britain, so American High School, I think). The second I walk through the door my mum tells me that her grandma's sister has died. ""Your great aunt Wyn died and the funeral will probably be soon."" My first thoughts were 'Who?' and 'Why is she telling me this?' I have actually never heard this name before or met this person besides the one time I found out today I had met her when I was still extremely young and unable to walk for myself. This turned into a slight argument as, for some reason, she wanted me to go this funeral, despite knowing I am a really awkward person at funeral's for people I've met more than once, let along a funeral for someone I've met only once and have no idea who is part of the family.   The argument ends with her trying to guilt-trip me by outright just saying ""Fine, I'll go on my own."" in a really sulky way.  


Her only arguments for me going were that I'd be going out of 'respect' and support for her, despite that she has never once mentioned this great aunt to me even though she supposedly played a massive hand in raising her as my grandmother, and that it's one of the few times we'll see the much larger branch of the family where it's likely to be a few hundred of us, about 10 of which I have seen more than once but still at most 10 times, maybe not even that. To me, it would feel like gatecrashing the funeral for someone else's family and that, even though I am part of the family, no one would want me there since I do not know nor did I know the person who died. I don't know how much this takes precedence over everything else but it felt like it had to reiterated a lot - I have never met this person besides the one time she met me when I was either 1 or 2 years old and the name has never been mentioned to me before now, at least not to my recollection.

0,"WIBTA if I tell my roommate to get rid of his pets or be home more? | Let me preface by saying I LOVE ANIMALS. I HAVE 2 DOGS.

Anyways - my buddy who is renting a room from me works 2 jobs so he's only home late on the week nights and not AT ALL during the weekend when he works his night job. His full day off from both jobs is one day a week. Because he works so much, his 2 cats and his dog are here in his room alone A LOT. the cats are typically fine, but his dog is young and in a kennel. Up till recently he's been decent at spending his free time with them and I understand his schedule so my fiance and I help out letting the dog out to potty and such. 

Lately however, my friend got a new girlfriend and now spends 90% of the time he's not at work with her... over the last few months on his days off he hasn't been here or he ""forgets to text me"" to ask me to let his dog out... I just have to figure out if he's gonna be home or not and deal with his dog accordingly - such was the case this morning. He should have been off work this morning and home by about 8 to let his dog out. He never showed. When I finished working I realized he wasn't home and texted him if I needed to let the dog out. He said he forgot to text me and ask.  No problem... except it's getting to be a problem. I go down to let his dog out... his cats dont have food or water. So let the dog out... let him play in the yard until I left to run errands.  Fed and watered the cats. Fed the fish.

It's now 10 hours after he should have been home and he's still not... if I had been out of town (which happens the beginning of most weeks for work) his dog would now have been in a kennel for 22hrs straight...

0,"AITA for insisting my wife request an Asian sperm donor? | I (29F) married my wife (31F) two years ago. We want to have our first child, we agreed on two, one for each of us to carry in pregnancy. We're also interracial, I'm Vietnamese, she's white.

She's going to be impregnated first and I've been asking her if she can get an Asian donor from the sperm bank so the child will reflect the same mix as us. I promised her that I'll try to request a donor with the same traits as her (height, complexion, hair color, etc.) so the child will look like her somewhat. I'm not even requesting she do the same, just an Asian one. She said she'd be OK with that but also asked why its such a big deal and asked if I'd love the child any less if he or she wasn't part Asian. This is insane, of course I would love any child she has and that we raise together, I just want them to also look like me on some level, we are both the mothers of the child. I also don't want either child to be easily recognizable of who gave birth like they're only the son or daughter of one of us and that they're not brother/sister(s).

1,"AITA for throwing away my girlfriend’s cigarettes after she lied to me about quitting? | My girlfriend has been an off and on again smoker for years. I absolutely cannot stand it, the smell, or any of it. We’re only in our mid twenties and I’ve been trying to get her to quit now before it kills her in 20 years. 

The other night she came home absolutely reeling of smoke and I asked her straight up if she had started again. She said no but I didn’t believe her. So I waited until she went to bed that night and I looked through her purse and found a pack of smokes hidden underneath a bunch of crap. I threw them out in the dumpster outside our apartment building. 

When she woke up she started rummaging through her purse and I asked her if she was looking for her smokes because if she is I threw them out last night. She started raising her voice at me that I had no right to do that and I shot back at her that she shouldn’t have lied to me about starting again. 

She stormed off to work and we’ve barely spoken to each other in a few days now. We’ve been together almost three years and this is our first significant argument up until now. 

When we have talked, it starts out as a normal conversation but it quickly devolves into her accusing me of being a controlling asshole and me calling her a liar.

0,"AITA for not thinking my husband's anxiety is relevant to my decisions? | We've been married 15 years when we got married anxiety wasn't an issue, it's really only been the last two years that it has started to be crippling for him. 

He loves to swim but he is too anxious to swim in the pool where we have a membership (too peopley I guess?), fine I take the kids to the pool by myself even though it would be a lot easier to have two people watching them. 

Most activities outside the house either I have to forfeit going, go alone or deal with someone completely ruining the vibe the whole time. 

Any time we do something as a family it is pulling teeth because he is just completely positive that the kids are going to get in trouble even though none of them have done anything really troublesome in years. 

We have a beautiful dog who is dying to spend time with other dogs to the point that any opportunity she will run off and not come back until she is tired. All five of the rest of the family think that we should get a second dog so that our dog will have a pack mate. It took time but I was finally able to extract from the husband that he doesn't want another dog because when the dog gets out he is anxious that she will get hit by a car and hurt the driver or passengers of the car. 

My opinion is that his anxiety is affecting the family in a negative way and he should go to the doctor and try to deal with it. He thinks we should all respect him and not do things that make him anxious. I feel like an asshole but I don't think that is fair. 

First off I want to just get a second dog so I can help my pet who can't help herself, forget his opinion. How dickish would that be?",False,False
1,"WIBTA for asking for wedding gifts back after the couple didn't get married? | This is an entire family debate, and I'm trying not to make this too specific.

A couple in my family was going to get married as few years ago. We all gave gifts, some material, mostly cash. A medical emergency cancelled the wedding unexpectedly at the last minute. They were planning another wedding and were interrupted by two back to back pregnancies (they now have two kids). They were still planning to marry at some point. The would be groom recently relapsed and the relationship is rocky. 

Almost 4 years later, they are still not married and may actually break up. We were tolerant because having children is expensive and they had plans to actually marry, but now we feel like we just funded a house and for the bride to be a single mom. This isn't something we agree with. We're not comfortable with this and at this point want our gifts back.

1,"AITA for excluding my gay brother from an event that I knew wouldn’t be LGBT friendly? | I’m 20 and my older brother is 24. I’m currently completing my undergrad courses at a religious university, and we are about to go through a ceremony that relates to the completion of theological courses. I can’t really explain in more detail without identifying my school, so I hope that makes sense. FYI, this is not happening in America.

Students typically invite their families to this ceremony, so I invited my parents but I didn’t invite my brother. The reason I didn’t invite my brother is that he has a very stereotypical flamboyantly gay personality, and my school is not an LGBT friendly environment, and this event especially so because it’s going to be really heavy on the religious aspect. I am very certain that my brother would be made to feel unwelcome if not directly harassed, and I assumed that given that fact he would be happier not having to come.

I explained this to my brother and he took it as me saying that he was incapable of acting straight. He basically said that he’s not an idiot and he knows a religious school isn’t going to be cool with him acting like a gay person (not the word he used but I’m not sure if it would get this post deleted) and that it was unfair for me to not to give him a chance to come and support me. I told him that I honestly thought it would be more rude for me to ask him to change his personality just to fit in. He said that I should’ve at least asked him about it first. It’s now too late for me to get an additional pass for the event so he’s not going to be able to come either way, but he’s still really hurt that I didn’t put him on my guest list. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for being pissed that my mom is sneaking a dog? | My wife and I rent. We have a 6yo son and two cats. My mother’s husband had had died a few year’s back and mom doesn’t drive and lived 2000 miles away from the nearest relative. She had nowhere to go and did not plan at all for her retirement. She lives off of a very small social security check per month and that is it so we invited her and her little dog to live with us.

The dog was old but it kept her company. When she came to live with us the dog would piss on everything. Naturally this upset my wife and I especially since my mom is like ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ anytime we bring it up. She’d act like we were putting her out because her widdle precious doggie who could never ever do such a thing was being persecuted even though we saw the little shithead just for example, lifted his leg on a stack of records or a stack of laundry. Or he’d cough up huge pile of barf and she’d pretend not to see it. Because that widdle doggie was just way too precious to ever do such a thing!

Mom would take off on cruises with her sister and expect us to watch her little precious every few months for two weeks at a stretch. This went on for several months. It didn’t make us happy and in fact started several fights. Eventually the dog died. It really was surprising that it lived as long as it did considering she rarely took him to the vet and refused to feed him dog food. I shit you not - this dog’s daily diet consisted of ham or turkey human lunch meat and some cheddar cheese. We’d feed that dog some real dog food and it would seem to be so happy getting some better nutrition but she would refuse to feed that kind of stuff to him. For months she avoided taking him to the vet because she knew that the vet would either want to do some costly procedures or put him down. To my mom, dogs can do no wrong, they are perfect little angels while people! Now people are the problem.

So mom has been away on another one of her two week excursions and she ‘unexpectedly’ fell in love with a new doggie and she’s going to bring him home. She didn’t consult with either me or my wife before doing so just announced it to us over text. Never mind our thoughts or feelings or our goddamn lease for that matter which specifically says no dogs. My wife is apoplectic.  Mom knew it would cause strife and particularly piss her off. My wife and I have both told her many times we don’t want a dog. Again, I know I’ve said it but I can’t stress it enough - my mom has a long history of being super kooky when it comes to dogs.  She won’t go and socialize or she’d even miss her grandson’s birthday party to babysit her dog (when it doesn’t need sitting). So that said, I can see how she’d rationalize how she’d need one. But to be so sneaky as to go behind our backs and do it this way feels very disrespectful to me and my wife.

Should we as my sister tries to make it seem ‘just be happy for mom because she found someone to love’?

0,"AITA for toppling over a girl's float and ruined her holiday? | We(9 college young adults) went for a short stay at the beach over the weekend. There were giant floats for rent and most of us were chilling on them on the water while enjoying the sun and breeze.


One of the girls, lets call her Lisa(good friend of my friend, not really close with me), had been constantly splashing me water and giggling away when I told her to stop. She was poking fun at the float I rented, a pink whale, which she said suited me(yeah, I am fat). She then kicked my float repeatedly until it toppled over, and I fell into the water as she laughed. Have to say the sea water was really salty, almost as salty as my feelings.


I swam up to Lisa(guess what, whales can swim!), grabbed hold of 1 end of her jellybean float, and with a sharp twist toppled over her float too. Lisa fell into the water with a scream. That would have been the end of my petty revenge, except that I did not know that Lisa could not swim, and the water was pretty deep there.


With the help of a friend and a stranger nearby we managed to drag Lisa to the shore. She was panicking so hard that she tore the strip on her bikini, and yeah, looked pretty much revealed. She also had makeups on her face which smeared with sea water and tears, guess she never intended to get wet at all. Lisa spent the rest of the holiday indoors and never stepped onto the beach again.


Even though nobody among us openly blamed me for it, I could sense the awkwardness in the air. Lisa completely avoided me and we haven't spoken a word til we parted.

1,"AITA for refusing to compromise with my roommates about my urinary habits? (My urinary habits are safe and secure, despite being ""peculiar"") | I often stay awake at long hours, until 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning, while my 3 roommates (I will name them Alex, Albert, and Fat Mack) go to sleep at a more normal time range of like 10:00 - 11:00 PM. 

I am filled with great anxiety at the notion of waking my roommates up several times by flushing the toilet at late hours. It seems to me that it would be so rude to awaken them. But, I must urinate several (if not many) times during the late night, because often I am drinking a lot of nice drinks (non-alcoholic on Monday - Thursday). 

So, my solution for many months now has been to urinate into empty 2-Liter Coca Cola bottles. Yes, I know it is unusual, and SOUNDS bad. But I take many precautions. I use a lysol wipe on the floor after just in case I leak a few drops (rare!), and I store the 3-4 bottles in my closet and cover them with a blue towel. 

When I have filled 3-4 bottles, I wait for all my 3 roommates to be out of the house and I pour the bottles out into the toilet or shower drain. 

Because of my precautions, no germs are created. Furthermore, on a more philosophical level, I have to say nobody is hurt by my urinary practices, and it is my own business. 

Unfortunately, Fat Mack came home and saw me pouring out my bottles, as I (like a true idiot) forgot to close the bathroom door. He was disgusted and enraged, and told my other roommates. They had a ""house meeting"" about it and all demanded that I stop doing this, as it is ""disgusting"". They say I am rude and ""gross"", essentially. 

I explained for them all about my precautions and how I was doing this for their benefit, but they still insisted. Out of principle, I feel now I can not compromise, I like the convenience of my urinary solution and it is hurting nobody. They are saying they do not want to live with me if I continue this, but I am saying they have no right to tell me what to do with my own urine. 

I know in some ways it is silly but I feel strongly I must stand up for my own rights in my apartment and that they are overreacting.

0,"AITA for refusing to downgrade my Netflix subscription? | Wouldn't necessarily call myself an asshole, but I can see how I could be considered bitchy in this situation.

A little background: 

I met my bestfriend almost 2 years ago when we were freshman suitemates. She comes from a background that has led her to being a bit stingy with money. Now, I'm not judging her for that considering I also come from a semi-similar, just not as strict, background. 

The stituation: 

During the summer, she asked me if she could use my Netflix account. I said yes, of course, and had to increase the subscription to the 2 screens at a time, just in case we were watching it at the same time. She offered to venmo me half of the subscription every month, but she never did and I never asked because it was automatic billing and I never checked my account to see when the money was coming out of it. 

A few months after her, another friend (who she doesnt know that well) asked for my subscription and so I had to increase to the 2-4 screens tier. They actually paid me at the beginning of each month, but like I said, I never checked my account (they have the same bank as me) so the money would go in and I wouldn't notice.

Fast forward to last month, I lost my wallet and obviously cancelled my card. This apparently occurred before Netflix was due and they asked her to update the billing info when she signed on one day. She offered to add her card, since I hadn't gotten my new one yet.

Netflix recently increased their pricing, so instead of $13.99, the subscription that we have is now $15.99. Today, she texted me asking if we could downgrade to the $8.99 plan. I told her not really, since there were 3 people on the plan and it wouldn't make sense for us to essentially have to police each other's Netflix times. She then tried to argue that we most likely won't be watching Netflix at the same time, because she barely watches it. I already know this to be a lie, since she practically uses it everyday.

I told her that I would just switch it back to my card instead. She still insisted on switching it, even though she hasn't paid me a cent from the previous months, so it wouldn't be like she would pay me when I switched it back. So I told her I would just get my own account and keep it simple. I honestly only said that because I knew that she wouldn't protest because that would mean her having to pay $8.99 herself, if she still wanted the service. I knew it was manipulatory, but I was honestly annoyed that she was mincing over a $2.00  difference because it just happened to be on her card for a single month, but when I was paying the $13.99/month subscription, she didn't offer or even cared that I was paying that much.

We've been living together for the past 5 years and of Course my parents and her mother(father not in picture anymore) come to visit us once in a while. Usualy when they come to visit both our parents come at the same time and stay in our Apartment. Every time they come there is a lot of stress from everybody wanting different Things and just being very different characters.

So last month they came again to visit us. But this time I couldn't take time off from work so my gf was stuck alone with all of them. Five days go by and when I arrive home from work my gf takes me aside and tells me my mother started moving Things around the house telling my gf,  who told her to stop that, that ""when I'm here Things are going to be put where I want'. Also telling my gf that ""I'm cleaning your home because it doesn't look clean at all"", after we cleaned the whole Apartment before they came to visit. So I took that as usual stuff, nothing out of the ordinary, because I was used with our parents just doing what they like and just waited for them to go home and our life to resume as normal. Fast Forward two days and there is a huge fight between my parents and me my GF and her Mother. My parents started the fight, and it was just about us not respecting them and letting them do what they want. The fight ended with my gf and her mother packing their stuff and going to sleep somewhere else for the rest of the visit to get away from my parents.

After they're all gone we go home and my GF sits me down and tells me that she is very dissapointed in me that I didn' say anything to my mother when she told me after those 5 days how she talked to her. And she told me that she doesn't think our relationship can go on much longer because she doesn't want to seem my parents anylonger and even if she forgave them, they will never Change and there were always going to be fights when they visit. I told her that I didn't know I was supposed to tell my mother those Things, because I thought she was also used to my mothers behaviour and was also just waiting so they go back to their homes. We didn't break up on the spot after this conversation, we just said we will see what will happen in the future for the Moment.

Fast Forward two day ago. Was doing some Research at uni and we met at lunch to eat at home because she works very Close to our home. I ask her how's work and she says ""stressfull"", but immediatly continues ""but not as stressfull as remembering you didn't tell your mother all those Things I told you"". And she closed with ""I don't want to be together with someone who doesn't know what he wants from life, a pu\*\*y"". Yeah that hurt.

0,"AITA for refusing to escort my mother to a funeral tomorrow | Okay, I've always had a pretty strenuous relationship with my mother and brother. A friend of my mother passed away and only eight people are allowed to go to the funeral and my mam doesn't make the cut as eight isn't even enough for all the family, so a couple of houses down from the funeral place everyone who isn't included in that eight will be loitering on the green. When invited I shot down the invitation for multiple reasons and my brother was originally gonna go escort my mother there, however, he decided to go visit Newcastle (needs to go on a train to get there) and sleepover his mate's house then walk all around Newcastle. 

Mother now doesn't want him to escort her he may be a carrier, so she wants me to. I've declined but my brother (on the phone) started badgering me and trying to guilt me to go, going as far to try and bribe me but I really don't want to go. I've always got hung up over the weirdest of things and will bend over backwards to avoid it. Im getting hung up over the fact that this is technically illegal and I want nothing to do with it, I'm also getting hung up over the fact I don't really care that this guy has died and I'd feel guilty being there.

I react poorly to social interactions and leaving the house and I'm stressed as shit so it has been getting worse. Mam won't stop talking at me or just loudly saying her thoughts that I'm just constantly hearing. I can't ask her to leave me alone for more than one reason so I've purposely been snappy and dismissive in an attempt to get her to leave me alone for more than five minutes and shes also using that to guilt me.

1,"AITA for refusing to attend my little brothers birthday party? |  Alright : My (23F) little brother turned 6 a couple days ago. His birthday party was past sunday and his entire family was invited. That includes the family of his mother, which isn't mine, for a total of 17 persons including me.

""MY"" family consists of my father, my step-mother, my brother and my little (step) brother (the one turning six). All the remaining people are people I honestly don't care about, even though they're kind and I've known them for a while. However, when they're at a party, there's no way to get in touch with anybody : my little brother will play with his cousins, my step-mother will obviously spend some time with her family and my father will socialize with the guests. My big brother is left but we see each other ""often"" already so there's no way we can entertain one another for five hours straight.

All of that is legit, but that makes me just HATE being there. I thoroughly dislike this kind of party - when I move from my home and get to spend time with people, that will be my family and no one else. Weekends are fucking short. I've got no time to spoil and, like everyone else, my week of work weights heavily on me.

Unfortunately and even more in this particular instance, parties including my step mother's family are the apotheosis of loneliness for me. Socializing with these people I don't care about is just exhausting, and I've got absolutely NO benefits of being here. It's just boring, tiring and annoying.

I told my father a couple days before the event that I wasn't gonna be here this year. I see them about once every week or twice a month, and I didn't think that my presence mattered that much. Turns out, after the fact, that my whole family has turned against me because of it, including my oversea grandparents (which I didn't get along too well with in the first place) who have nothing to do in this matter but were somehow told of my OUTRAGEOUS offense.

According to all of them, (excepted for my big brother who told me and my little brother who probably didn't even notice as a problem the fact that I wasn't here, will check on that when I see him, though) birthdays are big and important events of one's life and the fact that I was the only one missing is BAD. It makes me look like I don't care about my brother, family is sacred and missing a birthday party is a sin. On top of that I think they were uneasy and upset to have to explain to other guests why his own sister wasn't even attending his birthday.

I'm expecting quite a speech about all of this. My own birthday is next weekend, and I'm afraid that my stepmom won't come over because of this or they will tell me about their disappointment there, most likely ruining the mood for everyone.

0,"WIBTA if i told my boyfriend i didn't want his ""family heirloom"" engagement ring? | sup long time lurker, first-time poster

I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year and a half. It's been awesome and we have talked about taking the next steps into engagement and marriage. I'm pumped, he's great. The engagement is at least several months off.   
 This last weekend we were visiting his mom, she's quite the character, has been married 5 times, they have a tumultuous relationship. She and I were talking and she asked if I'd seen the ring yet, immediately my heart \~fluttered\~ a little bit, because omg he already got the ring!! How exciting!! I was like no and I wouldn't want to!! I wouldn't want to spoil the moment of seeing it for the first time when he gives it to me.  She goes on to say that she's surprised I haven't come across it already in his house somewhere and that he's had it in his possession for around 3 years- when he picked it up from her safety deposit box when he was getting ready to propose to his previous girlfriend.  My heart sank a bit, he and his previous girlfriend were together on and off for 6 years and it's a bit of a tender spot for me, because they have so much history, ya know? I knew that he had almost proposed to his ex, but it had fallen apart. I did not know he was planning on using the same ring he had originally intended for her.  His mother goes on to say that it's her ring from her first marriage and that she loved that ring the most and that I will love it, and that this ring is so special to her, referring to it as a family heirloom. Bf was born during her second marriage so this ring isn't remotely tied to him?? I do not know if I am being too sensitive but I do not really want this ring because to me, he once intended this for someone else, I feel I would be reminded of his ex whenever I looked at this ring. Plus it is not like it a true family heirloom passed down from a great grandmother or something, it is just his mom's (who he is very hot and cold with) first marriage ring. He has very sufficient funds to afford a new ring, and I have told him before that I wouldn't care if it was a ring from pandora. It isn't about how expensive the ring is or how big it is, but something about this random ring from his mom that he was going to use for his ex makes it all feel... so much less special and intimate?  After leaving his mom's I asked one of our mutual friends to ask him discreetly if he was planning on using his mom's ring and he told her he was.  WIBTA if I told him in the nicest way possible that I don't want that ring? I just want something special and meaningful. I don't know if I'm making a bigger deal about this than I should be.

1,"AITA for agreeing to have a baby only if my husband agrees to provide most or all of the childcare? | So I’m fully aware this may be beyond this sub’s paygrade but right now I’m in this phase where I just want as many opinions as possible.

Anyways, we’ve been together 7 years, married for 3. We were both childfree when we met but slowly he’s shifted over to wanting kids. Our marriage over the past year has been extremely rocky as a result since we still love each other and don’t want to live without each other.

But our marriage counselor in recent months has been pushing us to find a resolution because things can’t go on without getting worse. My husband sat me down a few weeks ago to talk about trial separation. He feels that if he misses his chance for children he’ll only resent me years later and he’d rather separate now than cause more pain for us. I’m heartbroken to say the least. 

Recently I saw a friend and she suggested something I’m afraid to bring up to my therapist or our counselor because I think they’ll call it crazy. She says I should just tell my husband I’d be willing to have a baby if he promises to take over all of the childcare, from infancy to teenager. This way we can stay together, he gets his child, and I still get to live my life as I’ve always dreamed. 

I havent asked him yet but I’ve talked to my mom and sister. They said it’s feasible but they can’t imagine this system working out in the long run, and that I’ll probably get more people judging me for being an “absentee mom.” AITA for considering this option instead of separation?",False,False
0,"AITA for turning down her request for money for her 'dying' family members? | So a bit of backstory, I play piano at the markets in my town, and make a bit of money off it too, in order to pay for my piano lessons. There's this chick who I met a few years ago (I'll name her M), although never talked to because she was one of those typical kids who were 'too kool for everything' and just an overall dick. anyway, This year, she's randomly been talking to me a whole bunch, and I've been responding with my general enthusiasm to be polite, although I never really liked her. After a while, she started to become a sort of tolerable person, and I'd almost consider her a friend. (Friends in my eyes are much more than most people consider them to be, So naturally I don't have many) Anyway, one day, I was sitting in English, and a mate of mine was asking how much I make from busking piano. I told him, and then M randomly pipes up, and says ""Can you fundraise for me?"". I asked her what for, and she said ""Family members of mine from \*CountryName\* had to sell all of their belongings and are having to sleep on the ground with no food, water or anything and are dying! Can you fundraise one day for me? I can pay you! $100 here is like $100,000 in their country!""From this, My initial thought was: Firstly, I don't think that's how money works. It may be a larger value, but it's still proportionally the same money, secondly, I've never ever heard of the country she stated and thirdly, What do you mean you'll pay me? if you can pay me for it, then why not just send them money yourself? anyway, I tried my best to very politely skirt around it, Making perfectly valid reasons as to why I couldn't, but she kept going at it. I then again, politely dismissed it. She then said ""What's up with you always saying no to things?"" And I felt really bad after saying that, but kept to my point, and told her it's not happening. The next part caught me really off guard... She said -And I quote- ""Fine, Don't think about the dying person then!"" At this point I didn't know what to say... I just sorta sat there, Jaw dropped like those typical movie clichés.. I eventually turned away and dismissed myself from the conversation, as she said ""Wait I was joking""I can't help but feel really bad, but at the same time, I personally don't think she was telling the truth, and -given her history- thought she was just looking for money to use for a specific malicious intention, But thinking that makes me feel even worse!

I've been living with my two childhood best friends for the past 9 months, we are all the same age in our early 20's and so far it's gone fine. Everyone pulls their weight around the house and financially and living together hasn't impacted our friendship negatively at all.

That said recently we have butted heads on one thing. All my life I've had a dog, my parents have always owned them and they are family to me, and since moving out of home I hate not having a dog around. I've been really wanting to adopt one for a month or so now and one of my housemates is keen, he's never been allowed to own a pet before and is more than happy to get a dog. My other housemate is a different story, he flat out said no at first. I kinda predicted it because he doesn't care for dogs and is kinda uncomfortable around them, but I was still annoyed that he just shut it down and wouldn't talk about it. We got into a mini shouting match and I went to bed annoyed with him.

A couple days later we brought up the subject with him again, he still said no but offered a 'compromise'. He said he would agree to getting a dog on 2 conditions:

-1. He wants no responsibility for the dog, that includes training, cleaning, food, walking, medical needs, and any financial things that go along with owning a pet unless in emergencies or if only he could look after the dog for an extended period. 

-2. The dog is not allowed in the house.

I told him what I thought of his compromise, that its a joke. I told him I was disappointed he would try weasel out of the expenses given we all agreed that things relating to money would be equal but I was seething at his 'Not allowed inside' demand. My dog is my family, I want to eat dinner with them, chill on the couch with them, let them sleep on my bed etc. He knows that and the fact he would ask that of me and rob me of that is hurtful and selfish. I told him that and another shouting match was had.

Anyway its been a couple days since then and I've been thinking. Its 2 against 1 on the dog thing, and he cannot physically stop us from getting the dog or letting it in when he's not around. Ive been in contact with someone selling a young rottie that looks like an awesome companion.

Am I overreacting? Small HOA Comm (90ish TH), mostly retired ppl. 5 board members incl me as VP (50F). Pres is 70M, Treas (T) is 65M, two other Dir (both 60+F).

Board mtg called to order. Open Forum is where residents bitch about whatever. Today no residents (we think, whew, this mtg will go FAST!). Except, T says, I have an Open Forum item. He says, it's about chrissy0116. She lets her dog out into the open area in back of TH not on a leash. And her son does too in front. That's against the rules. I reply, T, you know we stand at the back door, and son does too, right? He says, yes, but it is still against the rules. I just say, OK, noted. After adjournment, I turn to T and loudly say, I am extremely upset and angry that you called me out in a public forum over something so trivial. Had there been anyone in the audience, I would have left and resigned the board immediately. He said, well, it is a public forum issue and that would have been your prerogative to do so. I left and got more and more angry. This is a 14YO basset hound with one foot in the grave, who slithers himself off the porch, sniffs around the grassy area for 2-3 minutes and then hauls his old butt up the porch and back inside. We stand there and watch him in case he wanders off. Son lets him walk up and down the grass next to the house while he smokes, and then brings him inside.

After awhile, I called Pres and said I would finish my term out of professionalism and not to put Pres in a bad situation (1 F board member is leaving at EOM and another is an a cardiac rehab facility til ??). If I quit, there would only be 2 functioning board members. I told him that T was not welcome in my house for any reason, and if he ran next term that I would not run or serve. 

I realize that I have been breaking a rule (re-read covenants).

If the doggo happens to relieve himself in the shared open area, I always pick it up.

Townhomes are in a row of 6-8 with back porches and then 20 ft of open grassy area between the back. T lives catty-corner to our TH, and thus the dog wanders over by T's back door ever so often, but mostly stays behind our porch. Neighbor across from us (next door to T) has no issue with doggo.

When walking him, we always leash him.

Questions:

AITA - am I overreacting? He’s kind of a jerk because he is so obstinate (he demanded we write up various people for putting up their Xmas lights a week early for instance), but up til now I have always supported him even if I didn't agree.

WIBTA – I’m NOT going to follow the rule, because in this case, it's stupid. Even if he brought it up again, the Board would have to vote and the other Board members would not vote to reprimand me. If the situation plays out as described in #2, he might even quit in protest. 

WIBTA - I could demand he resign thru a board motion, and the Pres and other Dir would agree, as they dislike him also - too harsh?",False,False
1,"AITA for being mad at my bf's spendings, despite us not sharing finances |  I am fairly new to Reddit, so sorry in advance if this doesnt fit the theme. 

I just had a big argument with my bf and really can't see if I'm over-reacting or I am in the right. My bf and I have been together for about a year. We're both students, and both live at our parents. My family is very well-off, and I receive a monthly allowance that I use to pay my uni fees, transport, food when I don't eat at home, taxes, etc. I used to do a little bit of shopping / save up for vacations with what was left of it. He, on the other hand, is not as wealthy. His mom pays for his school, has no money from the dad, and also has siblings. They aren't poor, but aren't rich either. 

Since we got together, we made a habit of eating out together a few times a month (nothing crazy expensive). I've been paying almost everytime, because of his situation, and because or that stopped shopping or treating myself with my leftover allowance. Since has been looking for a job for ages, I asked my dad to give him a hand, and he got employed at one of my dad's friends businesses. The other day, he showed me, all proud, the beginning of his Marvel DVD collection (about 80 bucks worth), and I got very angry. The last months, he discovered Magic The Gathering and spent about 200 bucks on packs, and the DVDs really were the last straw for me. 

I told him he wasnt respectful of me for spending so recklessly the money I made it possible for him to earn in the first place, that he should be saving that up. That I was pissed he didnt say anything treating me for dinner for once, instead of buying all this crap. He got mad and said he never said anything about me going shopping, or my huge manga collection, and that the money wan't mine to begin with, and also told me that me buying him dinner wasn't an obligation of mine. I told him he was delusionnal about his finances: I could afford that, he couldn't.

1,"AITA for cutting my atheist brother off? | My brother and I have not always been extremely close, but we've managed a few good memories and some deep conversations over the years. That said, we've were raised in a very traditional Catholic home. Our mother would always force us (sister, brother, and I) inside a shitty cramped car every Sunday and we used to hate it. I even remember I got us all in trouble once for licking a page in the Bible as a dare (from him). Eventually though, we all grew up and found our own path to God outside of our parents -- except for my brother.

I love him, but he's always been the testy one. He's the one who would argue with my mother nonstop about trivial things like a bedtime even though she was just a single mother at the time with only the three of us. He's only really seemed to care about himself and his own sense of justice for most of our lives. He  told my mother that he is atheist about a year ago, and she took it a lot better than I thought. While not approving completely, she told him he was free to do as he wanted and that he was an adult capable of making his own decisions. But recently, her birthday came and she wanted all three of her children with her in church, as it happened to fall on a Sunday this year. Only two of us showed up, and you can likely guess who didn't. They got into a massive argument after that and he said things like ""that book is responsible for the death of my childhood."" I think that's such an overstatement, as we had a much better childhood than we could have hoped for. 

  
Not just that, but we've gotten into near-fistfights on multiple occasions because he's so damn resistant to anything remotely religious. I reached out to him with a scripture after our estranged father passed away and he threatened to block me. I was just trying to help. Then last week, after the whole birthday thing, I told him it'd be better if we didn't talk anymore. I think I'm going to try to convince my sister and mother not to talk to him anymore either, as I can't help but to view him as a threat to our happiness. I'm just doing what it takes to protect what family I have, and he's only given us negative experiences as of late.

Now I don't hate atheists or harbor any ill will towards them, but I believe that you shouldn't really associate with people that are this tormented. He has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I think he'd benefit from going to church as part of it may be to a lack of God in his life.

I laid next to them and started figuring out the machine so I could go to sleep.  I was expecting her to see me needing help and offer,  but she did nothing.  As I struggled I said I guess you weren't going to help then,  or something along those lines.  She then proceeded to get very upset which got me upset and now were not really talking.  

She says I never told her how to help and I say she clearly had zero intention of helping me when she promised to help.

1,"AITA for not being nice when my son made jabs about me moving away from them? | I have 3 sons. Matt(28), Mark(26), and Luke(5). 


When mark finished high school, I moved from WA to TN to help my siblings take care of our mom. My boys weren’t too concerned. They had other stuff going on and my plan wasn’t to stay permanently, just a year or so. As bad as it sounds, we weren’t expecting my mom to make it due to some health reasons. She completely recovered and doesn’t even live here anymore. She moved to SC. 


In the 3 years I was here taking care of her, I met someone and we had our son Luke. Luke’s dad and I aren’t together anymore but we share custody and he’s actively involved in his life. 


My son Matt gives me a lot of shit for moving. He always takes shots at me about not living near them or moving away. Examples:


Me: I miss you Matt


Matt: well you’re the one who moved to TN


Me: I hate it in TN


Matt: You apparently like it enough that you’d move away from your kids to live there





Most of the time I just ask him to stop or ignore him. We were together recently for my mom’s birthday party in Florida. Matt starts making his jabs at me for living in TN. 



This time I snapped back. I said “look, I have a FIVE year old son here. I’m not leaving him and I’m not taking him away from his dad. You can visit as often as you’d like but I’m not moving back just so you will be happy”. 


He just gave me a sarcastic response and said “of course. Why would anyone care about my happiness?” At that point, i just ignored him and he didn’t  talk to me for the rest of the night. 



AITA for saying that? I didn’t want to but I’m tired of his jabs. I can’t just move back and frankly, I don’t want to. I do hate TN in general but I have my siblings here in addition to my young son. And it’s much closer to my mom. I also have a job here. I moved to WA to be with my ex, mark and Matt’s dad. I had no family there outside of my kids and not many friends. Plus it’s much more expensive to live in WA than TN.



Also, in case it’s relevant, I see my older 2 sons about 5-6 times a year. I pay for their plane tickets twice a year and I visit them twice a year. The other times we see each other they pay for their ticket or we meet up somewhere for a family event(like my mom’s birthday for example).",False,False
0,"AITA for eating mac and cheese that I made myself after asking my (pregnant) wife if she wanted any? | Made mac n cheese last night and it was a large portion, maybe enough for 2 very hungry people. 

My wife usually goes nuts for my mac n cheese but during her pregnancy (7 months in) she has completely hated it and gags when I make it so I stopped making it as much, 

I asked her last night if she would mind if I made it since I was really missing something nostalgic and traditional. She said go ahead and she’d go in the bedroom and shut the door so she wouldn’t smell it. 

After I finished it off in the oven I asked if she might want some now or later because otherwise I’d have it. She said absolutely not and she doesn’t want it, just the thought makes her sick. 

I ate 1 portion for dinner and this morning I decided I’d have waffles bacon and mac n cheese for breakfast (don’t ask) and so I finished it off. My wife was asleep so I didn’t want to disturb her, and ask if she wanted any. 

This afternoon my wife asked where the rest was. I said oh shit babe I ate it. She flipped out on me and said I should have kept it for her and that ‘I should have known she would have changed her mind’. 

I said I had squared with her she didn’t want any, as far as I knew that was end of story. She is stomping around calling me an asshole and making herself some mac n cheese now, I offered to cook it for her but she told me to screw off.",False,False

1,"AITA For Refusing To Get Off An Elevator? | For background, I live in a medium sized but very dog friendly apartment complex. In this complex there are only two elevators and they are extremely slow. Not only that, but one of the elevators was currently broken at this moment so it took a long time for an elevator to arrive.

Now onto the story. So it was time for my two small dogs to go to the bathroom and I live on the 8th floor. I call the elevator to bring us down to the ground level since they are tiny dogs and going down 8 flights of stairs with them is pretty difficult.

The elevator finally arrives and there is one very large/ obese man standing there (for context , he was easily over 400 pounds ). He looks at the dogs and says, “sorry but you can’t come on, I have a dog allergy” 

I told him that this is a dog friendly apartment and there are dogs everywhere . If he really has an issue where he can’t be in the presence of dog hair then he shouldn’t be on the elevator period. He asked again saying that the allergies are severe and he has asthma . At that point I had had enough and told him that I am getting on with the dogs and they won’t go near him but if he has such an issue, he can get off and take the stairs . 

He was visibly upset by this and ended up staying on the elevators with the dogs until the ground floor. Once we were outside, we exchanged some choice words with each other and went out separate ways

For further context , I grew up with terrible animal allergies and have had to be hospitalized for them in the past. However, that was always around prolonged exposure of direct contact so I kind of doubt this guy was telling the truth .

0,"AITA for shutting off the WiFi. | Our kids are good kids but don’t do enough around the house, particularly on housework day. Wifey & I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money & spending.

I (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn’t feel very motivated because I’m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I’m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs & empty the dishwasher. He was in a game & said yeah yeah.

No sign of him and an hour later my wife said she’d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she’d get me to cut the wifi if he didn’t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn’t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can’t quit without risking a stand down for several days).

When I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable & put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this & that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back & so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.

He was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge & got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can’t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD & Aspergers so can’t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) & stormed downstairs.

Ten minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over & over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.

Wife calmed things down & later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn’t exchanged words. He’d already planned to stay at a friend’s so he’s probably getting plastered. It’s midnight now & wifey is worried because “he’s not in a good state of mind.” I can’t help worrying too. He’s not answering her texts.

1,"AITA for trying to enforce an equitable dress code? | Hi Everyone,

I was newly (external) hired as a site manger of an adventure / theme park. The park has several sites some adjacent and some disconnected. I was hired as one these site managers.

So when I cam on board, I decided to speak w/ the staff to learn the business and see if they have any suggestions. Several of the male staff complained that they couldn't wear shorts while their female colleagues could.

All staff had to wear a company polo or T-Shirt. For pants, men had to wear ankle-length khakis or corduroy pants (no jeans). They also, as mentioned couldn't wear shorts. Women had more options, being also allowed navy blue or black jeans, capris, yoga pants (if behind was covered), and shorts (khaki / walking/hiking style), up to 3"" above the knee. Women are also allowed to wear skirts, but other than some staff from certain religious sects, no employee wears it due to impracticality.

Now, I am not allowed to be lax on the dress code (if a customer complains, I'll get in trouble), but I am allowed to be more strict if I feel the circumstances warrant it. Being equitable I feel is a valid reason to be more strict and not allow female employees to wear shorts. Ideally, I would lax the dress code for male staff but I am not allowed to.

Well the female staff were not happy and are not co-operating. Female shift supervisors refuse to enforce the dress code on women and 70% of female staff started wearing short-shorts in protest. I cannot obviously send all of them home as the park wouldn't function otherwise. They also complained to my manager, and apparently they are referring to me as a ""misogynistic slut-shamer"" and that I should stop trying to police what women wear. This is ridiculous, as I am simply making the rules equitable. My manager is planning on meeting me next week to discuss all of this. But until that, I want to know, do you think IATA?",False,False
1,"AITA for pretending to be white on Tinder? | I am a 21 year old male of Indian descent living in the United States. I had been struggling on Tinder for a while and decided to shake things up last week by enhancing my pictures. When I played with their brightness and saturation settings, I soon realized that with a few tweaks I could make myself look... whiter. I uploaded the new pics to my profile and changed my name on the app to ‘Josh’.

The response was unimaginable. In a few hours, I got more matches than I had gotten the entire two months I was using the app. One of the girls I've been talking to, 'Brooke', agreed to meet up this Friday for drinks. 

My dilemma is, if I meet her in person she will obviously see that I am not white.

1,"AITA for spending a gift card knowing I wasn't the intended recipient? | A little background first. I created my gmail account when gmail first launched. So it follows the often used format of first initial + last name @ gmail.com. 

I am constantly getting emails for people with the same last name and first initial. I guess people doni't know their own email when they sign up for stuff. I stole someones instagram account because they created it using my email. I stole someons fortnite account because they signed up using my email. I even stole someones' fitbit account because again, they signed up using my email. 

Here's an [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1279/) to illustrate my point. 

So when I get these emails, I usually read them (I'm curious) and delete them. If I'm feeling charitable, I respond saying they have the wrong email. One day I get an email sent to someone with the same last name and first initial. However it was a gift-code for a $25 amazon gift card. The body of the message was thanking the person for something I didn't do. It wasn't a scam since the code was plain-text in the email. I immediately applied that gift code to my amazon account, and spent it.

The loss was extremely hard on everyone in my family, including me when I was old enough to understand what was missing in my life. 

My niece was born when I was 5 years old, we’ve always been very close and she’s looked up to me for as long as I can remember. Recently she came to me with the idea of her getting a tattoo in honor of my twin. She asked me what I thought of this idea. Before I had time to really think about it, I told her it was okay.

Now I’m considering telling her that the idea makes me extremely uncomfortably, but I’m not sure if that’s wrong of me or not. She’s only 15 years old and I’m worried that she only wants this tattoo because she wants a meaningful tattoo.

1,"AITA for leaving my Airbnb host a rude message? | A while ago, I stayed at an Airbnb with my dog. The owner was a nurse and came back home late at night after we had settled in. My dog is skittish and she barked at the owner, who must have seemed like an intruder in her new home. Thankfully the owner seemed very understanding.

The next day we met the owner’s own dog. It was a small Dachshund and it barked a lot at my dog. The owner said sorry for the barking and from then on put him in her room whenever we came out.

The third day, I was eating dinner with my dog in the dining room, which shared a glass wall with the sunroom where the owner's cats stayed. My dog hates cats and started growling at them when she saw them through the glass, just as the owner walked out of her room. The owner let out a big sigh and angrily said ""Can I give you some advice? I've had dogs all my life and it's not cool for your dog to growl at me. You gotta be firm with them and nip that in the bud or they'll walk all over you.""

I was flabbergasted and just replied “OK,” but I got more mad as I thought about it afterwards.

First of all she wasn't even growling at the owner, she was growling at her cats. Second, I didn't appreciate that she implied that I was not a good owner and was being walked over. Every single time she barked or growled I was doing my best to stop her and make her feel safe, even if it might not have seemed as firm or effective as the owner thought. Third, her own dog barked like crazy and she had even less control of him. I felt betrayed by a fellow reactive dog owner who I thought was understanding.

It was only after I ended my stay that I made my frustrations known. I didn't give her a bad review but left a rather rude message:

Thank you for hosting me. I wish I could say I had a great stay, but to be honest with you now, it was ruined when you angrily (and hypocritically) gave me unsolicited advice on training my dog. Also, your many comments demonizing her and making a big fuss every time we stepped outside made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome in your home. I'm glad you changed your listing to no pets because you're obviously not very good with them. I suggest you take your own advice in controlling your dog's incessant barking; maybe read up on that ""Dachshunds for Dummies.""

I later received a message from Airbnb telling me that my account received a warning and to make sure my pet does not present a risk. Furious, I called Airbnb support and filed a similar complaint about the owner's dog.

Now months after the fact, I somewhat regret my pettiness. My dog's reactivity has gotten worse since then and sometimes I feel maybe the owner was right in some ways and I also could have been more upfront. We understand her reactivity more now (shoutout to r/reactivedogs) and have been working hard to train her, more methodically than we had been at the time of the incident.

1,"AITA for wanting to use extra $$ for a vacation rather than for my step-daughter's college? | My husband James & I began dating about 10 years ago and married a few years after. We've raised our two girls from previous relationships in the same house for almost a decade. One rule we set in the beginning is that we're keeping finances separate. We make around the same amount of money so it's never been an issue. It has saved us from money-related arguments, if anything. 

My daughter Kim & step-daughter Lola are both graduating high school this year. For the past almost decade, we split the girls' expenses as follows: whoever was there would pay for it on their card (generally me, because I went shopping with them a lot more) and I would keep track of the money and at the end of the month we'd share how much we spent on the girls and then pay the other (usually him paying me) enough to even it out. Overall their expenses have been pretty much the same. Clothes, medical, sports, etc. There would be a random time when Kim's sporting equipment cost more than Lola's or vice versa but my husband & I don't haggle one another for those kinds of expenses. It basically evened out in the end.

But one thing we said from the get-go is that college expenses are separate. Lola's mom was not in the picture and Kim's dad was barely in the picture. My husband & I did not expect either of them to help us out, so we individually saved for our daughters. I have roughly $25K saved up for Kim's college, James has about $28K for Lola's college.

About a month ago, Kim's dad called me and told me he had enough money saved to cover some of Kim's college. I called bulllssshhiiittttt and told him to wire me the money if it's legit. He knows that I would NEVER steal a penny from my daughter, so he sent the money to my bank account a few days later and...it's legit. He sent enough to cover most of her college. I would only have to pitch in *maybe* $10K and get to keep the rest of the money I had initially saved up.

I was over the moon with this, told Kim and she's ecstatic too. I decided to take the left over money (around $15K) and stuffed half of it in my IRA & 401K then decided to use the rest to take Kim on a trip to Hawaii this June. When I told my husband he was very upset. He felt that I should take the extra money & use it either to help cover Lola's college or at least have Lola go on the trip with Kim. I told him that it's a lot of money that I worked hard to save so I want to enjoy it & we've always promised to keep our expenses separate, but he said that I should do what's best for Lola basically she's my daughter too. But again - we ALWAYS said college would be separate expenses. I just got insanely lucky that my ex gifted my daughter with this money. I feel guilty now because Lola is going to have to get a part-time job and take out student loans whereas Kim won't. AITA if I don't give Lola the money?",False,False
0,"AITA for keeping a game puck? | I was at a minor league hockey game with my daughter and a puck went over the boards and down at the bottom of the stairwell.

The other kid, maybe 6 was a few seconds behind her and started crying. 

I overheard the kid’s father come up to my daughter and explain they were from out of town and never get to live games so would it be ok if his son kept the puck. 

So, up to this point I would’ve been in favor of her giving it away because we go to a game every month or so. 

My daughter says “I don’t know, I’ve never caught one before” (true) and this is when I got mad. The guy starts trying to guilt my daughter saying “Now honey, don’t you think it would be nice to give my son the puck since he’s so much smaller than you? Look how sad you made him.” 

I could see my daughter was getting upset so at that point I came over and told them to move along. 

The thing is, I know my daughter wouldn’t really have cared one way or the other if she caught the puck. She would’ve enjoyed keeping it, sure, but she wouldn’t have been upset (let alone in tears) over not having gotten there.

At first I went with my either my brothers or my friends. But I quickly learned that my workouts were much more enjoyable if I trained by myself.  I could go at my own pace, decide my own routines, go at whatever time I wanted. I have trained by myself nearly every day for the last 3 months.

Yesterday a colleague and close friend asked if he could join me a couple of days a week at the gym. He has been struggling with alcohol and drug addiction and has decided that working out will help him on his path to sobriety.

I feel like I will be an asshole if I tell him no. He has done a lot for me in the last 5 years, from giving me lifts to work free of charge, helping me get promotions, lending me cash when money was tight and much more. 
However I really don’t want to train with anyone. The one hour a day I have in the gym is the only free time I have to myself. It’s the only time I have to really focus on improving myself and relieve stress. I have tailored my routine around myself and it works.

0,"AITA for demanding we make dinner rather than eat out because of financial constraints? | My wife (stays at home) and I are late 20s with a 20 month old at home and one on the way. Financially, things have been tight the past couple of years. My paychecks come every other week so that means that two months out of the year, we have an extra paycheck. Additionally, I get a bonus of 15% of my paycheck in November of a given year. Last year, unfortunately, I received only 7.4% for a bonus.

We use mint to attempt to plan our budgets around what I make in a month without an extra check. Thus far, including the extra check I already got in May, we have lost a total of $2,161 dollars this year. On average, we lose about $400/mo (more expenses than revenue). I have no credit card debt, but our savings is down to $2000 and we have some medical expenses for a surgery on my son and the obvious medical expenses expected in November when I have #2. My bonus this year is expected to be pretty substantial, but my wife plans to return to school next year and we fear our childcare expenses might hit us hard. The plan is to pay off a car and a loan with the bonus. 

Realistically, we will be fine once we hit November, but my wife complains that I am a hardass about spending, always asking questions, etc. Tonight, we had a big fight because I wanted to make food at home (I offered to drive to Kroger to even pick up items, make it myself and watch my son, anything to save the money), but she insisted on going to Chipotle.

After a serious allergic reaction earlier this year I'm scheduled to have allergy testing done. I don't mind that as it would be nice to know exactly what  I'm allergic to. However I'm also a narcissist and absolutely terrified of hospitals (I frequently faint). Part of the testing includes skin patch tests on my arms, which is where my problem begins. I don't like the idea of anything extra marking my skin so I refused to sign the form until I could talk to the nurse about the alternative options listed. I informed the lady up front I wouldn't sign until I had more info and she gave me the dirtiest look and rolled her eyes. There are other people waiting to see the same person I am so now I'm holding everyone up.

0,"AITA for not staying home and taking care of my sick wife all weekend? | On Thursday evening my wife started feeling unwell. I encouraged her to go to bed and told her I could handle the kids evening stuff by myself (3 kids, ages 9, 11, and 13). I checked on her after the kids were in bed at 9 and she was fevered- I asked if she wanted any medicine, made sure she had some water, and rubbed her back for a few minutes. I slept in the spare room but got up twice to check on her. The next morning I got the kids ready and off to school, went to a meeting and came home at 10 to take her to the doctor. I worked from home until our cleaning lady came around 1 and asked her to keep an eye on my wife and went back into the office for a couple meetings, picked up the kids and was home around 4. Her fever broke shortly after I got home at 4 and I helped her shower. Our oldest had a school dance and I got some movies and set the youngest 2 up in the den for the evening with pizza and some games so they'd be quiet. I checked on my wife periodically and after the oldest got home me and the 3 kids camped out in the den. 

On Saturday morning, the kids were restless so I took them out for the day bc I didn't want them to be around the house being loud. I checked on my wife and she was sleeping- I refilled her water and left her a note. Throughout the day I called and sent her messages and my mom took her over some homemade soup and checked on her. We were gone the majority of the day but the kids came home worn out and we crashed in the den again. I checked on my wife as soon as we got home and she was looking better. Sunday morning, the kids and I woke up early, did some yardwork then went to the store to do the weekly grocery shopping. When we got home my wife was up and about and still weak but feeling better. However, she was being really short with me and was in a bad mood. I thought it was just bc she didn't feel well but after a few hours of her making snide comments I asked her if something was wrong and she exploded on me that her family abandoned her while she was sick. She went off about how she always takes care of us when we're sick but we avoided her like the plague and didn't stay home and I made the cleaning lady and my mom take care of her instead of doing it myself. I tried to explain that I didn't want to expose the kids to being sick and I didn't want them around the house being loud while she was trying to rest and I checked on her multiple times. She said I should've sent the kids to my parents or something and stayed home and she can't believe I didn't sleep with her for 3 days. I starting getting angry and told her that I did what I thought was best and she sounded ungrateful bc it wasn't exactly what she would've done. She then called me an asshole.

My kids (15 and 13) love it and go over to play with it occasionally, my daughter also watches the neighbors’ kids occasionally. When the neighbors had their last dog, my kids would watch him, take him for walks, etc. while they were on vacation. Then that one passed and they got a new dog. This time, they were having someone else walk the dog, but asked our kids to come by and feed her and collect their mail. My kids were doing so, but then asked if they could sleep at the house. They said they just wanted to crash in the living room with the dog, watch a movie, etc. After dinner, I sent them over. Since no one was going to be home, I didn’t see an issue. I told them to leave everything as they found it, not to go through people’s things, etc. They had their cellphones and I trusted them to be fine over there. I think they just wanted to feel “grown up” for a night.

About two hours after they went over there, I got a text from my neighbor.

Neighbor: Are \[Kids’ names\] still at the house?

Me: Yeah, why?

Neighbor: We have a Nest camera set up. You guys have a TV at home don’t you?

Me: We do. They were just hanging out there. Are they doing something wrong?

Neighbor: They’re just watching a movie, but they’re there to feed the dog and collect the mail. That’s it. We’re not asking them to housesit. Please get them to leave

So, I texted my kids to come home, saying that they had to come home. They did straight away. I explained what the neighbor said and they understood. When the neighbor came home, they collected the key and told the kids not to do that again. In private, they told me I shouldn’t have allowed that. I apologized, but they seemed really pissed that I allowed it.

I know, you would never guess that, I know I look like I'm 35."" I laughed because I thought he was making a joke and I was trying to acknowledge what I thought was the joke. He looks every bit of his age and even older, he's not even one of those men who tries to look younger with hair dye, fake tan and facelift.

However she likes to cook and will often spend over and hour cooking some complicated dinner when we could easily just do something simple in like 25-30 mins. 
Also while she is the “head chef” of the house I’m always there in our tiny kitchen helping with the meal prep and whatnot. But when it’s time to do that dishes, that is 100% me doing it solo.

The mom tells her daughter she wasn’t going to pay $5 for 2 cookies, so she could only have 1. About 10 minutes pass, and the little girl comes near our area to throw something out in our trash can. I see her, and bag up a cookie and hand it to her and tell her “here ya go, its on the house”. She looked up at me and said “thank you thank you thank you!!!”, and ran off. Probably 5 minutes after, the mom comes up to the counter furious, and makes a big scene about how unacceptable it was that I gave her child a cookie without her permission, to the point where the grocery store manager was called over, and I was forced to apologize for being “disrespectful to not only her parenting, but as a woman.” So, AITA ?",False,False
1,"AITA for telling my girlfriend not to eat my food after she gives it to me | My girlfriend has the smallest tummy ever but gets hungry so easily. When we’re together she will always say ‘I’m hungry!’ So we will get food and she will only eat half of hers or whatever and then give her food to me. I’ve learnt to only order about 2/3 of food that I know will fill me up. I eat quite slowly so she will usually eat her portion then push her food over to me or whatever and then continue to pick at her food while I finish mine. It’s kind of a joke between us so I know she sees it as just a funny little thing but her continuing to pick at her food while I eat it (if we get burger and chips for example, she will continue to kinda pick at the chips while I’m eating the rest of her burger etc).

Her continuing to eat her food while I’m also eating her food annoys me for reasons I don’t really know. I’ll say ‘hey, sorry can you stop picking at my (used to be her) food’ and she’ll stop but roll her eyes and laugh at me. The other day I heard her talking to her friend saying I’m the best boyfriend but (quoted) ‘he does this really assholeish thing where I give him my food after I don’t want it but I still continue to pick at it because I’m still kinda hungry u know, and he always gets annoyed at me. I don’t get it because it’s still technically my food right?!’ And laughed. It wasn’t a super serious thing, they were just kinda joking around about how annoying boyfriends can be.

0,"AITA for telling a stripper ""No thanks"" right away? | This happened just last month. I (28M) really don't feel like an asshole but I have nothing to base that on.

I was at a buddies bachelor party weekend in Denver, CO. Saturday night rolls around and \~1-2am a group of us decide to go to a strip club. I had never been to one before and wanted to check it out. About 6 of us head on in and quickly hit up the bar after giving the place a once over. Pretty quickly a couple of the guys found a girl to give the bachelor a private dance. The two of them head off to the back while the rest of us start hanging out around the stage.

At this point I am just hanging out and enjoying the show. A few girls come on and off the stage and I was even throwing some money around (really not much). Eventually I am standing up near the stage and a girl comes up to me and says ""I have been looking all over for you!"". Now, I know this girl wasn't looking anywhere for me, it felt like a panhandler throwing a routine at me. Not really knowing what else to do I just tell her ""No thanks"" thinking she'd leave me alone. I really didn't want any private attention and was thinking our group would be heading out anytime as soon as the bachelor was done with his dance.

Her response to this was ""Why would you say 'no thanks' when I haven't offered you anything?"". I tried to explain that I am just here for a buddies bachelor party and just wasn't interested in anything. Keep in mind the club was extremely loud and it was very difficult to hear anything. Throughout our entire exchange there were a lot of ""WHATS?"" going back and forth. After this she says to me in a very offended tone of voice ""You come across as kind of a dick"".  Really not knowing what to do or why a stripper is mad at me I just start apologizing and try to tell her again that I am just here to support a friend and wasn't interested in a private dance. Again she tells me, getting more and more aggressive that she hadn't offered me a dance and it was extremely rude to assume that she would.

At this point I literally put my hands up in surrender, apologize again, and tell her this is the first time I have ever been to a strip club. I really didn't know what to expect. Again she it literally scolding me and tells me to not be such an asshole next time. I just leave my hands up in surrender as she walks away to another dude.

Was I really such a big asshole or was she having a rough day and wanted to take it out on me? I told my friends this after it happened and they all just joked about it but I now have a bad taste in my mouth about visiting a strip club ever again.",False,False
1,"AITA for asking my ride to leave earlier? | A friend of mine drives me to school. We don’t live too far away, maybe a 7 minute drive when there’s no traffic. The school doors close at 7:56 and you are marked late at that time. The true problem is that at about 7:45, a gruesome amount of traffic forms that takes at least 10 minutes to get through. Then, once you’re finally in the school, you have to park and STILL get in the doors by 7:56. I drive myself every other day, and leave at around 7:35 to get there at latest 7:50, as this is really the latest I can leave to avoid traffic. 

When my friend drives me, she picks me up at 7:45 and either end up having to run in the school or get a tardy. So the other day, it was 7:55 and we were about to pull into the school. I said something along the lines of “You really should start leaving earlier. We are going to get another tardy”. This really upset my friend.

1,"WIBTA if I talked to HR about someone in my office that hums all day? | For a couple months now someone has been constantly humming at work(quiet office building, IT department, majority coders in my area) throughout almost the entire day.  I’m the type of person that gets extremely distracted by things that most people don’t notice at all.  I recognize there’s a lot of ticks or repetitive things people do without being aware of and I’ve been as tolerant as I possibly can be.  There are few people that sit near me that constantly clear their throats, the cubicle opposite of me frequently does this long exhaled breath that makes the sound that you make if mouth the words “choo-choo-choo” while exhaling but not using your voice, someone taps thejr fingers by tapping pinky first, then ring finger, etc all in row when they get stuck on a problem(I think that’s why, but I dunno for sure), and there are a couple people that will makes repetitive taps for periods of time, plus a few more things.  

Basically there’s a lot in my quiet office that distracts and annoys me but I know I’m overly sensitive to these distractions and that I would be the asshole if i were to mention or try and address most of them as they are probably mostly subconsciously doing them.  BUT the humming is pretty much pushing me over the limit of what I can tolerate.  It’s not like its a 5 or 10 minute thing, it can literally be all day and sometimes it can be the same song over and over.  The other day was the Indiana Jones theme song over and over and over.  I don’t even sit that close to this person, and I honestly can’t see how anyone who does sit close has let it go this long.  

I’ve pulled up my company’s HR chat window a few times with intent to inquire on what i should do, but I never have.  I’m trying to tell myself that it could be uncontrollable on their part, but at one point does one person’s potential disability(or what have you) that affects others work become an issue?  I assume some responses will be to go address it in person 1 on 1 in private, but I don’t know this person, they don’t work with any of my associated teams, and I’m not looking to be mentioned in the office gossip for being overly fussy or acting like I have authority or feel I can to police others actions. 

Anyway, if I talk to HR about this issue, am I the asshole?

TLDR: Am I the asshole for potentially asking HR about humming in the office?",False,False
1,"AITA for eating 4 tacos before my sister had finished 1? | I (27M) am self admittedly a fast eater and my sister (20F) is self admittedly a slower eater.

My parents just kind of laughed 'oh you must've hungry!' but my sister was really pissed off because she worked too and made dinner and had to eat some filling 'tortilla-less' since I took so many tortillas.

0,"AITA for forcing my son to see how difficult it is to raise a baby? | My son sat me and his mother down last week and told us he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. He is only 17 and she is 16. I told him I was proud that he came forward to tell me, but I didn't get too far into the discussion before he told me that they are keeping the baby. Both have not graduated high school, and frankly, both are quite irresponsible. According to him, having a child is ""easy"" and not ""really that hard"". We tried to persuade him to look at other options, but he was adamant that they were going to have the kid and that was the end of that.

Since then, the house has been quite tense. Any talk of the situation is immediately shut-down and my son refuses to see what we are attempting to show him. I have decided to teach him that kids are more difficult then he initially thinks. Since my son told us they were pregnant, I have done the following:

1. I wake him up twice a night, 2 hours apart after he has fallen asleep. I open the door, scream as loud as I can until I know he is awake, and I shut the door. I've done this 5 nights in a row.
2. I purchased a sack of flour for him and dressed it in a diaper. I have made him change the diaper every 2 hours, and if he doesn't, I shut off the internet until he changes it. I will sometimes smear nutella in the diaper for added effect/mess.
3. While playing one of his games, I told him his ""baby"" wanted to be held. Giving me a truly shit-eating grin, he told me he has no issue playing his game and holding the baby. I placed the sack of flour in his arms and he continued to play basically one handed. While he was doing this, I went to the kitchen, grabbed a small cup of applesauce and splashed it on his shoulder while he was playing. I told him that his baby spit up and he might want to pause his game to take care of that.
4. I have not allowed him to go to the movies or hang out with his friends at their house. When he presses me for a reason, I tell him ""You dont have a babysitter. You can go if you take your sack of flour with you."" He has not gone anywhere in a week.
5. Yesterday, I did my best pratfall in front of his friends who were over and then wailed and cried until he came over and started talking to me. I told him babies demand attention, and he will have to get used to this. This was the last straw for him.

After his friends left, he accused me of being an asshole and for being ridiculous with the wants and needs of a baby. He told me I am being completely unrealistic. I reminded him that he himself was an incredibly fussy baby, and everything I have done so far he has done to me in the past.

His mother tells me I am being an asshole and to let him make his own decisions, but I don't want my 17 year shackled to a baby when neither of them are ready for this. If anything, I want him to realize how hard this is going to be, and to at least look at options.

1,"AITA for calling the police on a party? | Throwaway because I dont want it linked to my main. Also on mobile so sorry for formatting issues. 

Background: My girlfriend (25F) and I (27M) have been together for a little over 9 months. She is black. I am white. 

Yesterday, I was spending the night at my girlfriend's place. She lives in a duplex and has lived beside the same neighbors for two years. They aren't friends but are friendly. 

The neighbors had people over and were playing loud music and we could hear them. It wasn't a huge issue but it went on past 10pm. I told my girlfriend that I was going to talk to them but she told me not to because they had actually come to her a few days before to ask if it would be alright for them to host a birthday party at their house, knowing it would go late and she'd be able to hear it because of how thin the walls are. GF is a hard sleeper when it comes to sound so the noise wasn't really bothering her. I'm a light sleeper. She forgot about the party when we discussed me sleeping over. 

She told me she wouldn't be upset if I chose to go home but it was late and I didnt want to drive. I told her I was going over to speak with them. She decided to go herself. She comes back and they turn the volume on the music down and quiet down to a respectable level. 

Midnight rolls around and they volume has slowly risen back to it's original volume (the music stayed low but I could hear their conversation). GF doesn't wake up so I decide to call the police since they'd been warned. They show up about a half hour later. The flashing lights of the police car through the windows wakes up girlfriend.

She asks if I called the police and I confirm that I did. She gets incredibly angry and tells me that as soon as the officer leaves, I need to get out of her house. I ask her why and she tells me that she and I have had the discussion before that she doesn't believe in calling the police on other black people if no one is in danger and that, as a guest in her home, I should have respected that. She was also angry because she says I had the opportunity to go back to my own place earlier in the night when it was apparent the noise level that they had already cleared with her, was going to disturb my sleep. 

I told her I would leave but that she was being ridiculous and that if her neighbors couldn't be quiet after she asked them to then the next logical step was to get the police involved. 

She refused to have any further discussion with me and, once the police left after making everyone who didnt live in the other side of the duplex leave, she made me leave around 2am even though she knew I had work this morning. 

I've tried calling and texting her but the only response I got was a text telling me that she needed to evaluate if she could trust me to take issues in her community seriously and she needed some space to do it.

I still think I was right and it was inconsiderate of her to make me drive back to my own place so late.

I’m a driver for this place and have 2 other drivers that I work with. One of them is a cool and relaxed guy that’s there to earn some cash while in college, for the sake of the story we’ll call him Steve. Steve and I get along very well and have a system in place to decide who’s up next for deliveries. The system is basically first person back takes the next order up, for those who’ve worked in delivery jobs you know this is the Norm for how it works. Now that I got that out of the way on to the story.

So to start about the other driver she’s been at the place for about 2 years prior to Steve or I arriving so she has more experience then either of us. However she has a nasty habit of completely avoiding the system we have in place. For example I’ll be in the back folding boxes when I’m the next driver up and instead of coming to get me she’d rather take the order herself. Which kind of pisses me off when I come back to the system to find her on a run when I was in front of her. This has been happening for about a month now and a few days ago I made a complaint with the Owner in which he said he would talk with her. I’m thinking “ok cool he’ll sort her out”. Just yesterday she did it again, but this time not to me instead she did it to Steve. Steve was pissed and when she returned from her run he tore into her for doing it. She was actually in tears from how much of a tongue lashing he was giving her and the owner had to split them up. The owner I saw was talking with her and she came over the apologize to Steve and I for doing it, her reason was that she was concerned about the customers wait time and their food getting cold. My response was “It’s fine just don’t do it again” and to this she got pissy then stormed out the place. The owner came over and asked me what I told her which when I told him he got a bit angry with me saying why I couldn’t just say ok and move on.

1,"AITA for not neglecting my brother's cat? | My little brother got a new cat yesterday with my permission. He locked the new cat in the bathroom claiming it's some sort of introduction thing, only letting it out for an hour while locking the old cat in his bedroom. He'd only let them sniff at each other under the door. My friend has 3 cats, and she says she's never heard of this at all. She told me he's neglecting it, so I let it out while my brother was at work. The cats walked up to each other. They were full on hissing with the ears back and screaming. My friend said to let them work it out, so I did, and they've calmed down but we're avoiding each other.

My brother came home and saw them growling. He freaked out, threw the new cat's toy in the bathroom, and shut the door.

1,"AITA for getting angry at my mom for what she said about her boyfriend's past marriage? | I am an adult male in my 30's. My mom got divorced from my stepdad about 6-7 years ago. She has been with her new boyfriend for several years now. They live together, and he has a young daughter (under 10) from his previous marriage. He and his ex wife got divorced when the daughter was a few months old. I always found it strange that they got divorced right after having a child, but I never asked. He also bends over backwards for his ex, and lets her run all over him and never says anything about it.

Today I finally asked my mom why her boyfriend got divorced. She said, ""they just didn't get along and knew it would not work out."" I knew this was a total crock of sh\*\* and said, ""Mom, I love you to death but this is complete bull crap.""

She responded by saying, ""There are some details of their marriage that I have sworn to secrecy that I will never tell anybody. You got the gist of it and I did not lie to you. Just like if you told me something and you swore me to secrecy I would not tell another soul. I'd really love for you to please respect that.""

I do not know why she did not just tell me that to begin with, and it insulted my intelligence to know that she would think I would believe such a blatant ""bending of the truth"". So I responded by saying, ""That is perfectly fine. But that is all you had to say and you should have said that to begin with instead of feeding me some prepared statement. I'm your son and you can trust me - I'm not saying you need to tell me what you were sworn to secrecy about, but I feel like I should be given that information instead of ""they didn't get along"". I wasn't born yesterday and I'm not an idiot, so please don't ever insult my intelligence again and give me a prepared statement when you could have told me you were sworn to secrecy - because I would have respected that and would not have asked again.""

0,"AITA for putting the pizza on the oven rack? | Throwaway. I am a 32F, he is a 34M.  We do not live together, but have been dating three years. I am aware that this is likely “not about the pizza”.
On Black Friday last year, my boyfriend bought all new appliances for his kitchen.
The first time we made a frozen pizza, back in December, I followed the box directions and put the pizza directly on the rack. This resulted in cheese melting off the pizza and falling onto the bottom of the oven. When he went to get the pizza once the timer went off, and found the melted cheese, he flipped out on me and we got into a huge fight. From then on, i put the pizza on a cookie sheet/pizza stone as he directed.
Last week, we tried a new kind of pizza whose directions on the box say to place directly on the rack.  I used the pizza stone but the result was soggy pizza.  He complained all through eating it that it was soggy and did not like it because it was soggy and next time we should put it on the rack. I apologized.
This weekend, I bought same pizza and when I put it in the oven I remembered that it was soggy last time so I put it on the rack.  When BF went to get the pizza after the timer was up, you guessed it, he found cheese had melted and fallen onto the bottom of the oven - it was burnt and black.  He flipped out on me, going on about how I’ve ruined his new oven.  I try to explain that I’ll clean it up, he asked for that pizza to not be soggy again and I was just following directions on the box too.  His retort is that a) I should know that he didn’t mean that and to follow the ‘higher’ rule of NOTHING GOES DIRECTLY ON THE RACK, and b) I was disrespecting his property by “permanently staining his oven” with burnt, melted cheese.  I felt like a stupid child.  I told him he was overreacting over burnt cheese and that I would clean it out with soap/water once oven cooled off.. (but can we please eat dinner while it’s hot).  We go back and forth while I am scrubbing away the burnt cheese.  Once clean, he says he thought it was permanent and didn’t think the cheese would ever come off.. his anger is justified because it’s his property. I told him he’s being a jerk over melted cheese and that I had scrubbed it clean. His anger is justified, sure, he can be angry.  But I did not like the way he was treating me. I told him this. His reply was that “if you think that was yelling.. you have no idea.  I can show you what yelling is”.  Which to me is concerning.  If he reacts that way over melted cheese, I am concerned how he will react to what I consider a “real problem” (which I realize downplays something that is a real problem to him, but I still don’t think melted cheese deserved the attention it got.  He could have said “hey- I thought we talked about putting things on the rack.  Can you clean it up when it’s cooled off?  And I’d prefer if we didn’t put food directly on the rack going forward). I eventually just left and went home over the pizza fight. AITA for putting the pizza directly on the rack?",False,False

I planned to eat the fourth just for flavor I figured it'd make more sense to give it to her since she had made it very clear she's still ""incredibly"" hungry. I had literally put the piece in my mouth and didn't have the chance to bite it when she said that.

I quickly offered her the slice but she refused it because it was in my mouth and that makes it gross. I was confused and said something I now admit was super cringy ""but... You've been in my mouth"" however my point remains. She tells me that it's different and I can't figure out how so I point out how I've finished food she couldn't before and she's no stranger to my germs.

She said all of that's different, sharing food with anyone is disgusting. I pointed out that she's shared food with her mom before but again ""that's different and I need to just drop it because I clearly don't understand how bacteria works"" I do understand. I know that whatever viruses or bacteria I may have was spread to her when I kissed her seconds before I got the pizza out of the oven.

1,"AITA for refusing to pay for thousands for something my child broke? | I live in a pretty small town, so if you don't know somebody directly, you're likely to know a person who knows them, and this is pretty much biting me in the ass right now.

My husband and I are looking to upgrade homes given we're planning on expanding our family, so we've been looking at a few open houses recently. About a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table. Super bright, very loud, apparently VERY fragile and pretty much right out in the open. When I saw her touching it I told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle. Now, I'm not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but I felt extremely embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave.

A so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find the mask broken. Now she's hitting me up on the phone demanding I pay her back for breaking ""art"" and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures). I'm absolutely not going to pay her that, but a few people I know think I'm in the wrong here. I personally think if you're having an open house that children will be visiting you don't leave expensive breakables out in the open. I also do not believe for a second that thing was worth thousands of dollars, and if it was, I think there's a very good chance she broke it herself then left it lying around to pin it on someone else and guilt some money out of them.

1,"AITA for my gf and I keeping our income low to apply for lower income housing. | Ok so this is weird.

My girlfriend and I have been looking to move in together so we’ve been searching for apartments. My parents recently onformed me that they’d be moving to Phoenix, AZ in August so I would need to find my own place. 

A lot of the apartments were too expensive for our budget but we found 1 that we’re happy with. The complex was very nice and the lost cost we were told was 890/mo for 1 bed/1 bath. We were also informed of this application where if you and whoever are living in the apartment are making less than 32000 collectively a year then you apply for the “bond program” (I think it was called) that let’s you live in their studio apartments for less rent (about 550 a month not including utilities) We asked about the availability of the apartment and they told us that there are a lot available right now so it’s not like people are scrambling to get in.

My gf has been looking for a new job and would like to switch to full time when she finishes college. I told her that she should wait until we apply and get the verification that we apply for the program to actually go full time and she agreed. We wouldn’t apply until July. (She’s not struggling for cash or anything and i would help out if that ever were the case, this would strictly be to save money in the long run).

We also started trying to attack our debts together and would be basically living like poor people for the foreseeable future until we were out of debt. So this program would give us a head start. After the leasing period, if your income rises above 32000 a year you’d be asked to move into the normal studio (which is the same size and specs as the bond program one).

We cooould afford to live in the normal apartments comfortably but it would take longer to pay off our debts.

1,"AITA for approaching a sacred Native American monument after being told not to? | To start with, it's necessary for me to keep some of the details vague.

&#x200B;

Recently, a friend and I (both white) were traveling to see a monument in a national park. On the way into the area, the head guide explained to the group (maybe about 30 people) that the monument is considered sacred by the local Native American tribe and that they do not approach it closely. He went on to say that, though the park service cannot legally bar us from going right up to it, they ask that we be respectful and do not. The assistant guide who physically traveled with us to the monument itself was Native American, presumably from the tribe in question.

&#x200B;

Next to the monument, there's actually a smaller monument that's of some significance to my family, which can only be seen from up close. My friend and I started to walk towards it, when the assistant guide noticed us and told us not to. My friend countered that the rule about staying away was just a request and that we wanted to see the smaller monument. The guide repeated that we were not allowed to, then went to talk to some of the other tourists in the group. We went anyway, and when the guide noticed, he chased after us, saying, ""Hey, you're going to get us all into trouble."" After we got to the smaller monument, the guide said, ""Okay, you saw it, now please move away."" We complied, and nothing more came of the incident, though it was clear that he wasn't happy with us.

&#x200B;

My friend privately defended our actions to me, as he himself use to give that exact tour in an official capacity as part of the park service. He said that, during both his tenure and prior to it, it was commonplace for people to approach the monument. He speculated that the rule about staying away is either new or else depends on the whims of who is guiding the tour.",False,False

That struck a nerve with me. I ended up applying to rent the house behind his back and was offered a year's lease. I move in next week. I told my friend and he said he felt betrayed as if I was exploiting his unfortunate circumstances.  But I really liked the place and can afford it.

My brother married a lady from Europe.  She’s not French, but for the sake of anonymity I’ll say her name is Yvette and she was born and raised in Paris and came here for grad school, so she's been in the US for about fifteen years.

Yvette is much, much more blunt and outspoken than my family is, and frequently says things in public like, ""You're quite fat, you know.  How much do you weigh now?"" And things like that.  When I call her out on it, her only reply is ""I'm Parisian, that's just how we are."" 

The last time she did this was at Thanksgiving, and I finally replied, ""Huh. I guess I forgot you're just not that sophisticated."" Yvette lost. her. shit. and began throwing a tantrum and saying how she only cares for my health.

1,"AITA for keeping more inheritance money than my sisters? | My parents both died within about a year of each. Mum died in November. The way my parents did their inheritance was that whoever died first would leave everything to the other and when they died it would be given out (most of the money was in a shared bank account so technically he 'left' my mother almost nothing for logistical purposes and to avoid her having to pay inheritance tax - the house was also put in my name a year before my father's death for the same reasons). We're Muslim and my parents were quite religious. My sisters and I less so, but we’re still practising and have strong faith.

I am the only son and I’m the oldest child so, as per Islamic inheritance law, I get 50% whilst my sisters get 25% each. They also left the house to me, but since we all have our own houses and none of us wanted to keep the house, we put it up for sale and everything was processed last week. 

Technically I should get all the money from the sale but since that’s not fair and doesn’t keep to the 50/25/25 rule, I said I’ll more than happily give them 25% each. They were both upset by this and by me getting 50% in the first place, which they did mention beforehand but we were all still grieving over the loss of both our parents so we never really talked about it. My parents were doctors and so were fairly well-off and the house sold for over £600k, and the whole inheritance totals to well over £1mn so this isn’t a small amount of money.

I explained that it was left in my name and they aren’t entitled to any money from the sale at all and it wasn’t in my parents’ wishes to give them any of it either. We debated a lot about this being Islamic law and my parents wanting to follow it and how we should also follow it. A few older family members have weighed in and they all say that it shouldn’t be split 33/33/33 (some say I’m doing the right thing by keeping to the 50/25/25 rule whereas others say I shouldn’t actually be giving them any at all). Splitting it equally would be against Islam. It surprises me that they're doing this, we're relatively traditional in that when it comes to matters like this, or family disputes, we listen to our parents, but not a small amount so I do understand. They're really unhappy about the inheritance not from the house but accept it as it was written into the will and believe asking me to give them money to make it equal would definitely be un-Islamic but still feel unfairly treated.

None of us needs the money, we’re all established doctors in our late 40s, all married to other doctors and we all have 2 kids so none of us needs it more than the others. I don’t want to cause friction in our relationship but I’m just following what my parents would’ve wanted and I’m giving them more as well. They’re arguing over around 40k each from the house that they really don’t need. But in fairness I don’t need it either so AITA or am I just following my parents’ wishes and our religion?",False,False

I close them every day but she opens them up again and says she forgets to close them before night. She has the smaller bedroom so pays less rent, and I know she can't really afford much else, but I can't keep doing this.

1,"AITA for hooking up with my brother's brother-in-law on a cruise ship with my kids? | 47F, my kids are 11M and 17F.  

My brother (50M) recently got married to his wife (46F) on a cruise ship.  It's a small family wedding so it was just close family invited on the ship, and then the wedding was going to be on one of the beaches where we stopped.  The other guests in attendance included the bride's parents and siblings, their kids, and the bride's and groom's kids.  My kids were also invited.

The bride's brother (42M) was pretty attractive.  I'm recently divorced so he and I started chatting and flirting.  He doesn't have kids, and was sharing a room on the ship with his father, while I shared a room with my two kids.  We wound up getting drunk and making out the first night on the cruise.  My kids didn't see, but their cousins did.  Their cousins must have been teasing my kids about it, because the next day at the buffet my daughter told me that I ""dishonored the family"" and my son barely wanted to speak to me.

Then, at the formal dinner later that night, my kids insisted on sitting with me when they saw me sitting with 42M.  I was trying to send them signals to get lost but either they purposefully ignored it or were just oblivious.

I later discovered that my son, probably in a way to ""act out"" had been assuming a Borat-type foreign persona during the entire cruise experience.  My daughter had been playing along.  Multiple people came up to me telling me how ""interesting"" my ""adopted Romanian son"" was.  Many people asked if there was anything wrong with him.  Then at the end of the cruise he broke down in tears saying that he was afraid if he started acting has himself again instead of this foreign persona, that the whole cruise would ""hate him.""  It was just a total disaster.  I also found out that my son, daughter and their cousins were riding the elevators on the cruise and smooshing their faces against the glass.  Multiple people on the cruise have complained about our kids being unruly.  I feel like they are doing this to get back at me.

Of course, now that we are back home they are still mad at me for making out with 42M.  We have continued to see each other but my kids don't approve and are embarrassed that I made out with him in public on the cruise. That said, considering our room situation, we had nowhere to go.

* The first stillbirth, we'll call her ""Dianne"", happened at 9 months. This was 7 years ago.

* The second stillbirth, we'll call her ""Sarah"", happened at 6 months. This was 4 years ago.

Regardless, she has had 4 successful births, currently aged 1,3,6, and 9. They're a happy family together, and have not forgotten their unborn children. They held memorial services for both, for the immediate family. She has gotten tattoos of their footprints on their own feet, and can't wait to get to heaven to finally meet them.

My brother feels similarly, but that's mostly because of his choice to support and comfort her through both losses. They're his daughters too, and could've moved on, but it hit his wife hard so he went through that journey with her.

As far as my dad goes, I'm positive he was not impacted so harshly. He was definitely there to console them in their loss, and was briefly sad that he wouldn't get to meet new granddaughters. But, he made years of happy memories of his 5 living grandchildren.

My SIL wrote this in the draft of his obituary:

> Ralph is preceded in death by his father Tony and granddaughter’s Dianne and Sarah.

My SIL has been very open about her losses on Facebook, and everyone in her circles knows about them and knows they're truly lost family to her. However, my dad's circles and my SIL's circles do not overlap so neatly. There's people that know my dad that have never met my SIL.

Around the same time I got hired, they hired a mentally challenged guy who did the same program as I did, at the same school. Because of this, I know he didn't really...earn his degree. He was sort of passed along and never had to do the work we did. I know he couldn't finish at least two of the required courses, and there he was with us at graduation.

All real easy stuff. So, at this point, he's just an awkward dude I had to remind to try rebooting, and to chew with his mouth closed.

Thing is, he's smart enough to know that he can use his...status to his advantage. He started claiming he had too much work. So they stopped making him do any tickets at all - and you know what? Cool. Awesome. People didn't really always know how to interact with him, and he didn't always know how to interact with people. Awesome.

Thing is, he kept going. Over the course of a year and a half he just kept complaining about having too much work. So here we are, all he has to do is the BASE IMAGE of a computer. A process that - on a really bad day where EVERYTHING goes wrong - should take two hours max per machine. He's set up to be doing seven machines at a time.

He only does one per WEEK though. So I have to go out and get chewed out for new computers not being done, while he gets praise showered on him for doing literally nothing all day. He just eats...all day...with his mouth open.

So we found our nanny and we’re discussing the finer details before she moved in etc. I asked what she would want to do about meals, that I can prepare her what our kids eat for breakfast and lunch (which she eats with the kids) and then for dinner I can cook her an extra serving or she can prepare her own food with our food. She said she was happy to eat whatever I prepared for dinner but she would prepare her own (non vegan) breakfast and lunch to eat with the kids.

Her room has a bathroom attached but no kitchen. She has her own cupboard in the kitchen and shelf in the fridge to store all her non vegan food. She has been with us for about 9 months now and so far she has been preparing her own breakfast (usually just yoghurt and fruit) and making herself a sandwich for lunch and then eating whatever I prepare for dinner with our whole family. Every Friday she has the afternoon/night off and I always cook her dinner and put it in the fridge for her to eat when she gets home. 

About a week ago she came home from her night off and I heard her in the kitchen. A couple minutes later I hear her cooking something and so I went out to say hi and see what she was doing. She was cooking a steak. At the time i didn’t really have a problem with it. But the next night when I was about to serve dinner she goes to cook another steak. She eats her steak and it’s fine but after I have a chat to her and she says she is kind of sick of the vegan food and that she will be preparing her own dinners if that’s ok from now on. Honestly I wouldn’t mind if she cooked her own dinner every now and then but if she is going to being cooking meat in our house every night I’m not really comfortable with it. The smell is gross and it leaves blood in the pan and the kids have complained that they dont like the smell either and that they don’t like the idea of the nanny eating cows. I don’t have a problem with her not eating vegan, it’s a personal choice but I am kind of uncomfortable with it. So I asked her to just be more sensitive about cooking meat and maybe waiting until after the kids are in bed (so they can’t smell it or know she’s eating an animal) and she said she has the right to eat a proper meal. So AITA?

Tl;dr: our nanny is not vegan in our vegan household and has recently decided she doesn’t like eating our vegan dinners with us so has started to cook meat for herself. I asked her to be sensitive about it but she thinks I’m being unreasonable",False,False
1,"AITA for performing a breast examination on my wife's best friend? | Disclaimer: I am a physician.

My wife's best friend, ""Lily"", came by my house the other day to drop something off for my wife. Lily and I have also become quite close through my wife, and we often go out for dinner together with her and her husband. She dropped in and then as we were conversing she mentioned that she noticed a strange lump on her breast and was wondering if I could take a look at it. 

I didn't think twice about it, and brought her into a different room. Note: my wife was not home at the time. I felt her breast and told her that everything was okay, and she thanked me, and went on her way. I have performed over 100 breast examinations and it did not seem like a big deal to me at all, just a simple medical examination.

I did not tell my wife that this happened, not for the purpose of keeping my action a secret, but because I did not think I should discuss Lily's medical concerns with my wife. Lily told my wife a few days later, and my wife became upset at me both for performing the examination and for not telling her about it.

My wife said that I could have simply told Lily to see her family doctor rather than ""feel her breasts"" myself. She understands that it is a medical examination of course, but still thinks it is weird that I saw and felt her best friend's breasts, which I do understand. She said it will now be in the back of her mind whenever the three of us get together.

It is true that I simply could have told her to book an appointment with her physician, and I could have considered the possibility that the information would be weird for my wife. However I felt like I was just doing my friend a favor and it would be inconvenient to make her book a whole appointment for something I could quickly do on the spot.

1,"AITA for pawning my mom off on my SO? | My mom and I used to have a great relationship, but she was somewhat of a helicopter parent and that, along with a few other things, strained our relationship. Now that I've graduated college and live on my own with my partner our relationship is better, but it's not quite like what it was when I was younger. She makes attempts to reach out and stay involved in my life and generally I don't respond, preferring to keep her at arms length. I don't necessarily want her out of my life, I just want her to understand that she doesn't have an all-access pass to me and my life any more.

In order to keep updated on me and what's going on in my life, my mom texts and group messages both me and my partner, knowing that if I don't respond, my partner will. I more or less have no problem with this, because there's still a buffer between me and my mom and it doesn't give her direct access to me. However, my partner has expressed to me multiple times that he feels obligated to respond to my mom because I won't, and he doesn't want to ignore her texts because their relationship started fairly rocky (When I told my mom about him, she basically said she wanted nothing to do with him.), and now that they have a pretty great relationship, he doesn't want to do anything to damage that. We also have vastly different views on family- while I'm more apt to write my family members off if necessary, he's very family oriented and wants our families to have good relationships.

I've told my partner about my mom and I's rocky relationship, and that I understand his problem but I don't want to be guilted into talking to my mom, and he's free to ignore her like I do if he doesn't want to talk. My partner has accepted this and we've moved on, but I kind of feel like I'm unfairly pushing my helicopter parent problems on my SO.

1,"AITA for skipping the line to pick up my order? | So this happened some time ago but I’ve mentioned it in conversation and it has been somewhat polarizing. 

I was heading to a family gathering at my Mom’s place and my sister asked me to pick up some Little Caesar’s pizza for the kids that would be there. I knew there was one right next to my mom’s, so I called ahead and asked them if they had what I needed (they did) and if they could put it aside for me. 

When I arrived, there was a considerable line of people waiting. I had been to this LC before, plenty of times, when I used to live with my parents. I knew this line was for putting your order in and waiting for it to be prepared. Since I had called ahead, I felt like I didn’t need to wait in line, kind of like when you place an online order. 

When I get to the counter and start to ask one of the employees if they’ve got my stuff ready, a woman in the line leans over to get my attention and tells me that I needed to get in line at the end “like everyone else”. I told her that I had called ahead for my order, making the line unnecessary. She said, “That doesn’t matter, you have to get in line”. I got a little upset at her attitude so I just ignored her and continued on speaking to the lady, who had heard the interaction and decided to call over another employee, as she now seemed unsure whether to give me my food. The second employee told the first that it was fine so the first employee rang me up and I was on my way. 

Should I have made the line if it was just to pick up the order? Or was I fine skipping the line since I knew the line was for making orders and I’d already done so? 

The place does not have two respective, dedicated lines for order and pick up and I didn’t see sense in waiting for so long to just pick up the food. The employee’s reaction also made me doubt my actions a bit, but I wonder if it was just her attempt at de-escalating and attempting to pacify the lady in line by not giving me what I wanted so as not to show preference or something.

I’ve told this story before and I’ve gotten some people that said I should have made the line, but it’s far fewer than people who told me I did nothing wrong, so I just wonder if I was the asshole that day.",False,False
1,"AITA for adding fiber? | So I work at a Smoothie King. Nothing too hard, but it can get hectic when a lot of people come at the same time. We had a good rush, maybe fifteen or more people. We can also work for tips. 

The last girl in line of the rush comes up, sees there are only two people working, and says “Wow, that took a long time.”

I decided to ignore her comment and still provide excellent service. 

As the interaction goes on and she orders her smoothie, she continues with the rude attitude. Huffing and puffing when I ask what size smoothie, rolling her eyes as I asked for her name, etc. By the time that it’s time for her to pay, she looks at the credit card reader and says “Tip?

0,"AITA for cutting off my daughter? | My daughter was born when I was very young and my ex-wife ended up running off with someone and left the country as she couldn't deal with raising a child. I was 20 at the time and tried my hardest but in the end I couldn't handle working, going to school and being a single father. My parents tried to help but they were the other side of the country and it wasn't feasible. In the end my daughter was left with them whilst I finished school and tried to earn money. I visited as often as I could and when she was 2 I moved back to my parents to be with her.

My mother died when my daughter was 6 and my father fell apart, suddenly it was about me raising my daughter whilst working and looking after my father. I'll admit I wasn't the most attentive father as I just couldn't deal with it all and as she became a teenager I was rather strict with her. I didn't give her much freedom as I didn't want her to make the same mistakes as I did. I wanted to her to focus on her studies so that she'd  have a brighter future than I could provide for her.

When she was 18 she decided she didn't want to go to university and wanted to explore the world. This was fine with me and I explained she'd always have a home here to come back to no matter what she decided to do.

She travelled a lot with her friends but it seems by discovering the world she meant partying, doing drugs and excessive drinking. After about a year her funds ran out and she came home. She suddenly wanted to go to university and I was ecstatic about it. I offered to pay for her studies and even help her with rent and expenses if she wanted to move out. The only thing I asked in return was that she tone down her partying an no more drugs.

She decided to stay in the house with me and her grandfather in order to save money. At first everything was going great and she was focusing on her studies. Paying her purse wasn't bankrupting me but with medical bills for my father each month was quite tight. 
She passed her first year but that was the end of it. During her second year she stopped going to classes, wasn't coming home often and by the looks of social media was back to partying and drugs. I sat her down and explained she wasn't holding her end of the deal  but this just led to tears and screaming that I was stifling her.

At the end of this semester her attendance was so low that the university wanted to exclude her, however I explained her grandfather was sick and they agreed not to do anything as long as she did well in her Janurary exams.
I haven't seen her since before Christmas, she still texts to let me know she's ok but that's it. She's partying, back tending drugs and seems to not care about her studies. I also found out that despite me financing her she still took a student loan so she could have money to support her lifestyle.

1,"WIBTA for refusing to let go of the flight attendant job as my twin sister? | We'll be nineteen next week for starters. 

My sister got a job as a flight attendant for a regional airline a few weeks ago, the day after thanksgiving, she'll be moving to her airlines base and going through flight school. I'll admit that I kind of freaked out and applied to a similar job without her knowing and as a result, I'll be joining her but working as a flight attendant at her sister airline. So we'll still be twins and flight attendants, but more like fraternal since we're working for similar but separate airlines. 

My reasoning is that we've shared a room our entire life and so we can do the same now, we can share a bank account, keep sharing makeup, we can share outfits, share jewelry, we've always shared and we can keep doing that. We've never been apart and so that's why I got the job, I don't want to be different now. I've always been clingy and I don't want her to be different from me when we've been the same person for so long. 

Last night she decided to explode at me and our mom with our dad on her side, they're of the opinion that I should let my sister have space and let her grow up without me but we've been together since conception, I don't want that to change now. 

Our mom thinks that it's normal for us to be together and be matching and she's the one who encouraged me to get the job and helped me apply, I applied to my sister's airline as well and if I get a call from them in the next few days, I'd have the opportunity to operate flights with her. She thinks it'll be a big adventure for the both of us. 

Our dad thinks that I'm taking her dream, single white femaleing her, and unable to let go of her.

0,"WIBTA for kicking my girlfriends older sister out of our apartment? | Apologies in advance. This is a really long story.

I’ve lived with my girlfriend for 2 years. We moved to the apartment we are at now a year ago. We used to live with her sister and another couple. We’ll call my girlfriend L and her sister J. We moved because J would always have people over , and we wanted the privacy of no roommates. Once we moved, someone took our spot there.

Fast forward from when we left (May 2018) to January 1st, 2020. J fucked her roommates over by not paying the rent for two months, as our landlords just accepted cash. For two months, she took the $3000  spent it on “bills” that her sister isn’t even sure about. After ruining her relationship with her roommates, She got the money from family to pay the rent off, and asked L and I to move in until the end of January. Her uncle would pick her up and she’d move out of state. 

She basically never asked the uncle to come get her, mentioned to L that she might just stay in New York. My girlfriend, who isn’t confrontational, never opposed her living with us for free. So J has been with us for about 4 months, no job, just contributing sometimes with cooking. She only comes here to sleep after she parties with her friends. Our house is essentially a hangover den.

What makes matters worse is because of the current situation, the job she had a chance at has shut down. So shes not even looking for work. But that isn’t stopping her from going out every other night, to parties, where she doesn’t even think that if she was to get sick from being stupid, it would affect us as well.

L wants her out, but is really conflicted because it’s her sister. I don’t think she’d be happy about me speaking to J about it, even though she also wants J out.  I don’t want to seem like a dick, but it’s at the point where I might just take the risk of L being mad at me. I want my home back.

I’ve been trying to get L to talk to her, but she just hates confrontation. I think I might just have to tell J if she doesn’t find a job to fund her getting her own place, she needs to to back to her mothers. WIBTA?",False,False

We were at home and she was out of sight for a minute. When she walked back over, I saw that her entire sleeve was wet (from arm to shoulder). I was confused until I checked the bathroom and realized she had been splashing around in the toilet (water was all over the floor).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I think that's pretty disgusting so I just tossed her in the bathtub and gave her a quick bath. According to my wife, I totally overreacted and should've just washed her arm. While I admit that I'm a bit of a germaphobe (what can I say, I think you should take your shoes off in the house and wash your hands after using the toilet), I figured it'd be easier to just wash a squirming baby in the tub vs. trying to wrestle her arms into place at the sink. Not to mention that if she was splashing the water, she probably got it elsewhere and that's not very hygienic.

Weirdly, this escalated into a huge argument with the wife. She's adamant that I went overboard and will cause my kids to get all OCD about the bathroom. Am I the asshole here?

Our son (17) is failing English and history, and just does not seem to care that he will not be able to graduate next year if he does not pass these classes. His attitude is terrible and he is hanging out with friends who are becoming a bad influence (i.e. drugs/drinking/smoking). He is in therapy twice a week and we have tried to be reasonable and understanding with him, but I am at the end of my rope. 

My husband will not discipline him at all, he told me this morning he doesn't give a shit, he can just fail and be homeless, but he is done and doesn't want to deal with it anymore. 

This morning I got an email from my sons English teacher who told me he is missing three assignments; and if completed and sent today he will be able to pass the class. I sent my husband and son the email and told him that he needs to get those done and sent in and he started screaming and cursing at me telling me he doesn't give a shit and won't do them. I texted my husband at work and asked for support and he said he didn't give a shit let him fail. 

I finally broke down and told my son that he will do the assignments immediately and told him he has no cellphone until they are done and emailed to his teacher. After a few minutes of screaming and cursing he told me he would do them and then told me to fuck off and leave him alone. 

The assignments are now done and turned in, and I am waiting to hear from his teacher to see if they are acceptable. In the interim I texted my husband and told him that we was being extremely unsupportive to me and that I need him to back me up. He told me he just does not care anymore. I told him he was a selfish asshole and a terrible father and if that is how he really feels then he should be ashamed of himself.

(Throwaway, mobile)


I've been seeing a lot of posts lately about proposing at weddings etc, and I'm starting to worry if I'm an asshole, especially after what I was told at the end.


Here's some backstory, my brother, his now wife, my girlfriend, and I are all very close. We grew up together on the same block, went to school together, and pretty much did everything together. We all always joked about getting married on the same day, etc...


So when they told us they were getting married, we were both really excited. I was made best man, my gf maid of honor, we helped them plan the whole thing. It was honestly a ton of fun, I was so excited to help my favorite people on their special day.


One time, I was hanging with the to be groom, and bride (gf was at work) and they asked me when I was going to propose to her. I had been planning it for a while, but I didn't have any idea when to do it. Then the groom says, ""How about at our reception!""


She agreed with him, and they both gushed on how they'd love to share the date of our engagement, and the wedding, how they could play a song etc...It was all pretty overwhelming.


I was a little hesitant, as I didn't want to take the attention from them, but they were really excited, and said it was a brilliant idea, so I agreed.


I bought the ring my girlfriend had her eyes on (we were talking about getting married for a while) and the special day came. The ceremony was very sweet, (Not going to lie, I shed a few tears) and we went to the reception at a fancy dance hall.


Later in the night, my brother asked for the mic and eagerly gestured me over. The whole room went quiet, and I asked my girlfriend to come to the dance floor.


I got down on one knee, and she said yes! (I dropped the ring cause I was jittery, but she laughed, best woman in the world folks!) My brother and his wife looked just as happy as she did, and wished me congrats.


The rest of the night we partied and had a lot of fun, mostly joking about old times, etc...


Later in the night, my brother and his wife got up to go talk to a relative of hers, when the bride's grandmother taps my shoulder. (I had met her once before) She informs me that I was very rude and should be ashamed of myself.


I told her that we had planned it with the couple, but she said it didn't matter. My girlfriend tried to defend me, but I said it wasn't worth starting fights and ruining the evening. The Grandma soon left anyway, but I felt bd after rhat. It soured the moment a little, but I tried not to let it bother me.

english is not my native language so have mercy.

My girlfriend has a huge familiy. She has 7 ""real"" silbings and 2 halfbrothers. The mother lives with one of her daughters and her two sons from her second husband alone. My girlfriend, my daughter and i live pretty close to them. Only 10 min drive. The area is pretty rural. Bus and train come by every two hours and only in bigger cities who are like 20 min drive from us. The car of her mother broke two weeks ago. Nobody except me and her has a driverlicense.

Thats the settings of my story.

Since her car broke down i helped her out. Driving her to the supermarket and getting some stuff when i come from work. She could do this while her 14-15 year old sons are at school with no problem. Bus and call taxi are reliable, but since its easy and am willing to help i just do it. Also she drove me 1 time every week so its kinda a payback even if i just gave her already money for this. She asked me to get her a really specific item and the store didnt had it so i just told her to order it online. Its some kind of paint. She lost it. First she tried to told me she did so much for me and i was ungrateful. She said that in a pretty aggressiv way so i didnt said anything. Than she went beyond and insulted me and said things which arent true. Since then i just stopped talking to her and dicided to dont help her out until she apologize. This was a week ago. Since now she didnt apologize even if we saw each other when i picked my girlfriend and kid up. I am sure she knows from my girlffriend that i am expecting this before we can work on getting things done.

Today the 14 year son injuried himself at the schoolsports. His finger is blue. He did manage to get threw school and drove back to home after school. So he comes home and his helicopter come lost it and demands i drive him to the hospital. I thought its unnessary but i will drive him, but not her to the hospital. And hes old enought to tell the doctor what he has and to wait alone there and that i will pick him up afterwards. Since i had an appointment in the city it would be fine.

Thats where the shit hit the fan and everybody was mad at me. I dont like doing it but i just demand an apology for the stuff she said which was pretty insulting. (Fuck you, lazy ass etc.) Since i am the only one working fulltime its also just wrong. If she would call me personal saying it like ""hey i know stuff still shit but this is an emergenzie and we can talk afterwards"" than i would drive her even if i think its not urgent but thats not my buisness.",False,False

1,"AITA for refusing to pay for damages done to a family friends house done by my dog? | So to preface, we have a 5 year old Siberian Husky, and while she's sweet, she can be a handful and has a history of chewing up siding and has caused other damage to our house.

My family has been planing a vacation across the east coast for a couple of months now, it's planned to be about a 10 day trip. Over the past month, my brother has been looking into local doggy daycares for Ridley to be boarded up in while we're gone. He had found some pretty decent programs that were nearby, and even did a tour around one or two. He had pretty much decided on a certain day care for Ridley spend the week at while we were on vacation. Que in my sister [17F] who starts suggesting that Ridley spend the week at her friends [17F] house (Sam). They also have a dog around the same age, and fenced in yard for the dogs to run around and play in. My brother was hesitant because he doesn't want Ridley to get anxious or excited because of the new environment at this house and possibly cause any damage, but the sister and the friend are both adamant that everything's gonna be OK. Sam had mentioned she had talked it over with her parents, and they love Ridley and would be happy to watch over her for us. Plus they'll do it for free (minus dog food and what not), so he'll be saving about $300 from not having to pay the day care. After some back and forth, my brother gives in and agrees to letting Ridley spend the week with Sam and her family.

Long story short, they get back from vacation, and of course, Ridley has done some damage to their house, tore out some siding, chewed up one of their cages they tried to get her to sleep in, and some other things. Sam's dad is pretty upset and is wanting my brother to pay for the damages. My brother is pretty firm that he isn't paying anything. Sam's parents agreed to watch over Ridley and he even voiced his concern that something like this would happen, and they still knowingly wanted to dog sit Ridley. My sister and parents both think that my brother should foot the bill for the damages, or at least pay for some of the damages, but I'm kind of on my brother's side and that he shouldn't be responsible for anything.

Granted, he probably could have handled everything better, like meeting with Sam's parents and discussing his concerns with them directly instead of having having everything go between my sister and Sam as his point of contact, since they aren't the ones who own the house, but Sam had originally said she talked it over with her parents, and they were fine with it as well. I'm pretty sure my brother will have to chock this up as a learning experience, and just pay them (which will probably amount to what he would have ended up paying the doggy day care) but just wanted to ask all you all here to see if we are the assholes for not wanting to pay for the damages done to the family friend's house?",False,False

For some context, I’ve been seeing my boyfriend for a year and he started staying at my place 24/7 almost from the beginning (I live in the city centre so it’s convenient). Before this he lived with his parents about a 15 min drive away. About 5 months ago I asked if he would start contributing to rent and bills, since he lived at my apartment and the electricity bill went up significantly since he started staying here.

He agreed and brought the remainder of his clothes over etc. A couple of days ago, he came into the apartment with an open letter from the electricity company. It was the electricity bill. I told him there and then that I was uncomfortable with him opening my mail, and asked for him not to do it again.

Today he came into the apartment with another of my letters, opened. It was from the electricity company again. They tend to send me multiples of the same bill (I’m trying to get them to stop this to reduce the paper waste).

He says he has the right to open the mail because it’s from the electricity company (their logo is on the envelope) and he contributes towards bills.

He has said multiple times even just last week he'd want to live around here after college.

Anyway he wants to major in 3d animation, which if we lived in a place that had a bunch of jobs for that I'd be fine with paying for. The thing is we live in midwest where there just arent any jobs that do that around here.

His older sister wanted to major in computer networking and got a nice gig at the local hospital doing small tech support that said they'd hire her on the network team if she got a degree in it. So yeah she met the job qualification so I did pay for that.  Youngest kid(15) wants to do pharmacy stuff, and if he still wants to fine theres jobs around here for that I dont mind paying for that.

Now i get why my middle child is upset, but the type of life he wants, 3d animator in bumfek midwest, just isnt here and he's know the deal to get me to pay for his college for a long time now.

1,"AITA for telling my mother, who stole my cat 4, almost 5 years ago, that the cat is no longer mine? | A little context. My cat wasn't doing so hot before she stole it. A pretty severe heart murmur the vet said would only get worse. I was heartbroken. She would get stressed in the slightest (think a light spook, like walking around the corner when she wasn't expecting you, or excited to play with a toy) and give a helpless yowl and just... Fall over over the spot, breathing heavily. It hurt me seeing my baby hurting so badly. I decided I'd rather she didn't suffer and scheduled an appointment to have her put down after seeing no improvement for about a week.

My mom offered to take her (with her husband) to the vet to have her put down because the choice was already killing me. I agreed, and they picked her up that day. I know it was cowardly, but that's the decision that was made. 

Then, a few hours later, my mom texts me to say that since she was loaded into the car, she had improved. She wanted my permission to take her to her house in a town 5 hrs away and possibly nurse her back to health. Elated, I said yes, overjoyed to possibly get more time with my baby of, by that time, almost ten years. I would later learn it was at this point (admittedly I'm getting this info from her, so she could just be using him as an excuse) her husband said he didn't want her back in the environment that was my house, because ""obviously"" the stress was killing her. 

As an aside, I had previously lost the cat that was her son four weeks earlier and bought a new boy in hopes it would reduce the stress of not having a friend. If it had been brought to my attention in a reasonable timespan, I would have found him another home to have my girl back, as it had only been about 3 weeks by this point if I had an inkling he might have been the cause or that it was the reason they kept her from me. I mourned her here, as she informed me she wouldn't be coming back. 

Now FF 4, almost 5 years, and my mother texted me that her health was declining. I politely informed her ""she's your cat, not mine."", and said nothing more on the subject.

My roommate has made comments before about how she doesn't understand why I get up so much earlier than I need to for class (8 for a class that starts at 11) but I didnt think much of it since she's kind of judgemental and makes comments on basically everything I do.

However, the other day she started questioning me on why I have ""so many"" alarms set, and I explained to her my reasoning. She wanted to know why I cant just set one alarm for when I actually wanted to get up and then just not go back to sleep, and didnt seem to accept the answer when I said I know myself and I wouldn't be able to get up the first time.

She then went into how she was asking because she hasn't been getting much sleep lately and my alarm bothers her. The only alternative to the system I have now that I could see being effective is if I set my phone out of reach of my bed so I had to get up to turn it off. The only problem with this is my bed is lofted so I would have to climb down to turn off the alarm which would have the alarm going for an awfully long time and I know I would rather three really short times of an alarm going off than at least a full minute of an alarm going off at once.

0,"AITA for not telling the guy I've been seeing that I live alone? |  

Been lurking now I'm posting.

A little backstory: I (24f) just moved a few months ago to a new city. I work from home and have a two bedroom apartment where one acts as an office. I wanted to live alone for that reason.

I'm new to living in the city but I have friends here so I'm social/know people who live around me. After settling in for a few months, I decided to start dating. I met a guy on a dating app and we hit it off. We've been seeing each other for the last three going on four months. The first month, we hung out in public pretty exclusively ie restaurants, bars, festivals/events, etc. He's walked me back to my building and I walked myself inside.

A month and a half in, we started to hang out at his apartment. Both after we went out and then as dates. We'd just watch movies, eat takeout, talk, etc.

He has a roommate: a friend from college. His roommate frequently hangs out with a friend who lives in their building and we typically try to schedule apartment dates then. There have been times when his roommate has come home early effectively cutting date night short. We’ve just kind of dealt with it.

About a week after we made our relationship official and exclusive (just recently), I decided to invite him to my apartment. We walk in and he asked where my roommate was. I told him I didn’t have one and I lived alone. He asked since when; I said since forever. He asked why I didn’t tell him so I told him my reasoning.

As a woman in a new city, whose family is states away, I didn’t want to let a stranger know that I lived alone because you never know who you’re telling. I wanted to trust someone before I revealed that vulnerability.

He was upset because we spent so many dates at his apartment making plans around his roommate and having his roommate walk in on us when we could have been completely alone at mine. I tried explaining my reasoning and he only kinda got it but also said he was upset I lied.

I never mentioned a roommate. Never said I had one, just didn’t invite him up to my apartment. So I guess it’s a lie by omission, I’ll admit that. But I didn’t set out to lie, I was just trying to be cautious.

We finished our date though he was a bit short with me. He’s also been short on text conversations and we haven’t made plans when we’ve been seeing each other two or three times a week.

So am I the asshole for not telling the guy I’ve been seeing that I live alone?",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I kept ignoring my ex + refusing to talk to him about why our relationship ended? | 4.5 yrs ago I met my ex and instantly fell for him - mostly we had an amazing relationship for 3.5 yrs. Last summer I moved away for college 6hrs from him and till the beginning of this yr things were good. Then in Jan of this yr he had a mental health crisis/breakdown which was v difficult for me and gave me some doubts about us. He's said to me since, that during this time he felt dissasociated and he doesn't remember most of it which I believe. I didn't come back home to visit him bc I was busy with college (which I know he feels let down by since when he lived in a different city for a yr he came back frequently when I went through going to court to get my estranged dad convicted of harrassment - that's relevant later). After 6 weeks I told him on the phone I wasn't happy with things and was considering ending things and it seemed to flick a switch in his brain - he asked me to give him a chance to fix his mental health and we could work things out when i was back for holidays a month later. I agreed, and for the few weeks following we took space and didn't talk much and he started to turn things around.

Then before the holidays, I found out my dad killed himself. It fucked me up bc and obviously that became my priority, so a week later I ended things with my ex pretty abruptly - I wasn't in an emotional place to actually talk about things so I promised him I'd talk properly a couple of weeks later before I went back to college. However, then I had the funeral and it left me rly upset so I told my ex we'd talk when I was back in summer - he was hurt but accepted it. Then in summer I did see him briefly, but not to talk about what happened just to see how we were. I think we both put on a brave face bc we were both struggling (for different reasons). Not long after, he called me and said he'd been rly patient and asked if we could finally talk properly about everything so he could get some answers + closure. Honestly the prospect just rly upset me so I told him I couldn't right now, and when he text me asking for clarification I didn't respond.

Some other stuff happend like he came to my flat at one point bc he was worried about my wellbeing, but moreorless I just haven't replied any time he's messaged me and we still haven't spoken. He doesn't do it frequently, last I heard before this week was 3.5 months ago he said he accepted I was still too emotional to talk so he'd contact me in a few months. He msgd me again this week asking where I was at and I've yet to respond bc I find the idea of talking things through with him upsetting.

Some mates think I'm being an asshole bc we had a long relationship and he's waited more than 6 months for what I did initially promise him, and they say I'm prioritising my dislike for one conversation over what has prob been months of confusion for him.

0,"AITA For never helping my girlfriend with her dog? | To start, my girlfriend and I have been together for over a year, and so far things are going really awesome. She has a 5 year old large breed dog who I like, but I'm really, really not a dog person. I'm not really an animal person in general, but definitely if I had to have a pet I'd want one that was way less maintenance. Still, she loves her dog, I love her, we're all cool. I'm not mean to the dog, I don't ignore the dog, I play with him sometimes, and I go with her to dog parks and that sort of thing occasionally as well. 

A few months ago, my girlfriend started talking about moving in together. I told her I would normally think now is a good time in our relationship for that, but that I wasn't really comfortable living with a dog at this time. She argued and said that she would take 100% responsibility and care of him. I thought it wasn't possible, but she assured me I wouldn't have to do a single thing I didn't want to. 

I thought it was a pretty bad idea, but I suggested a trial period where she stays with me, and if it works out by the time my lease is up, then we move into a bigger place together. She agreed wholeheartedly, and moved in.

At first things were fine. But one week, she got pretty sick, so I took care of her dog that week. Then, she had to go out of town, and I took care of the dog then too though I mentioned to her in the future, she'd need to make other arrangements. Things like this kept cropping up. She needed to go to work early, her friend was in town and she wanted to go out. Sometimes I refused, but each time I did, she kicked up a fuss. I tried reminding her of our deal, but she said it was only sometimes and only for ""extenuating circumstances"" and it was ridiculous to expect her to pay money to watch her dog when I was at home.  

So I told her when my lease was up, I'll be renewing it on my own here, and that I didn't feel like the trial had gone well. She got very upset about that, and started to argue a lot about how she didn't expect NO help, just not a lot, and her dog will live for at least another 5 years, did I expect we'll never live with each other until then. I told her no but right now I value the freedom that I have not caring for another creature. I also said if it changed in either direction, I become more okay with it, or I realize I'll never be okay with it, I'd let her know immediately. She didn't like that either. 

Some of her friends have pulled the ""wHaT aBoUt WhEn yOu HaVe KiDs?"" but obviously my kids would be  a totally different thing for me, and I've shut it down each time she's tried to argue that. Others think I'm some dog hating monster, which isn't true either.

1,"AITA for asking my work colleagues not to bring Vegan food to staff lunch? | Hi,

I'm not sure if I'm being oversensitive to the point of being an A, or if my work colleagues are the A's here. \*All opinions are welcome, if I'm the A here, I'm going to try to own it\*.

I work in a small office, team of 9 people. I am the only Vegan. I don't preach or try to convert pothers, it's my choice, and my business. Plus I live in a rural farming community and Veganism is viewed in general with mild suspicion, hostility or ridicule.

Anyway, I can't afford to attend the staff Christmas meal this year. (I'm a single parent saving for a mortgage). 

To reassure a concerned work colleague, I explained that aside from financial constraints, the thought of being at a table of people eating meat made me feel very uncomfortable. So it really wasn't a big deal for me to miss it and she shouldn't feel bad.

As well as the annual Christmas meal, we also have a staff Christmas lunch the day before, low key, held in the office, we all bring our own food. A different work colleague sent an email out this week requesting that every one bring a Vegan dish this year. 

I felt surprised about this and confused, so asked why this was. The colleague advised that I speak to the person I had confided in, who responded by looking down and not saying anything (sort of in a joking way, but they still wouldn't speak to me, they can be a bit strange sometimes). 

Please bare in mind that Veganism is often a deeply personal choice. It is also difficult to get Vegan food, and is an acquired taste. I'm not going to lie here, some of it is overpriced and grim, \[if you dont know brands to avoid and cost effective alternatives\].

With this in mind, I sent a borderline pleading email out to everyone, thanking them for being thoughtful. I was honest and said that I felt uncomfortable as it seemed restrictive, and it would be better if everyone just brought what they wanted to.

I received an email response refusing my request stating that people 'didn't mind trying Vegan' and 'we are ganging up on you lol'. (I dont think this was meant in a horrible way, but I felt frustrated that I had been ignored).

I spoke to another work college and explained how uncomfortable this was making me and how the Christmas lunch shouldn't be about my Veganism. I also shared how I envisioned people gagging at the food or opening up awkward conversations about Veganism as a lifestyle choice.  

My work colleague was really nice and sent an email saying she would be bringing a meat dish and that the lunch shouldn't be themed and there shouldn't be an issue.

The manager then responded by email that she would be bringing Vegan dish. Now I keep getting asked by (mildly panicked) colleagues how to make Vegan dishes.

But we went back to my place and things got weird from there. She started demanding that I order pizza because she was hungry. And then she grabbed my laptop and put on some really obscure movie. When the pizza got here, she started jamming it into her face with no plate or anything. On my bed. 

The next morning I offer to buy her breakfast. Really I just wanted to get her out of my apartment because I was becoming increasingly unattracted to her. 

Problem was that every restaurant was closed. So after about the 3rd restaurant she started saying that I could just take her home. So I agreed and started headed to the next block over where my car was parked. She must have liked me and been nervous. But the stuff she was saying was just... weird.

I tried to blow it off but then she said words I'll never forget, ""What kind of car do you have? If I like it I might just have to steal it!""

I mean. Of course. Of course she's kidding. Right? 

But it was the maniacal cackle that followed that made me start thinking. What if she liked me and I didn't like her back...how would she handle that? 

I nervously decided against bringing her to my car. I just didn't like the idea of night after night having my car parked out on the street completely vulnerable. 

Instead of bringing it up, my instinct was to think of some way out of this. 

I was spinning myself up thinking of all the crazy horror stories I've heard on Reddit. That's when I resorted to drastic measures. 

I kept insisting that I treat her to breakfast. That it was the right thing to do. Wouldn't take no for an answer.

My plan was to invite her to sit down, go to use the men's room, and then simply never return to the table. I didn't know what else to do. 

But after literally the 8th restaurant we went to was closed (wtf), I began to panic. How was I going to get away from this woman without taking her to my car?

That's when I saw the shining beacon. A tiny convenience mart. I walked in, grabbed a frozen steak sandwich, some kinda potato, and an orange juice. I told her to get whatever she wants and I set my stuff on the counter. 

She was in back of the store. I was in the front. I put my index finger up at the clerk to signal like I just received a phone call. I held my hand over the phone and said, ""gotta take this, put everything on my tab."" He looked confused. I didn't care. 

I walked out slowly. As soon as I was out of sight, I shoved my phone in my pocket and ran faster than I ever ran before. 

I heard her call after me like 30 seconds later. She said, ""wait, where are you going!?""

Without looking back or slowing down I yelled, ""it's an emergency!""

She was pissed. Started sending me angry texts. I just apologized and said it was a personal emergency. 

But at least she doesn't know what my car looks like. ",False,False
0,"AITA for not taking my mate to work anymore even though he works less than 5 minutes away? | So just some back story before I continue, my best mate got a job in Shrewsbury 2 years ago and originally his dad was taking him to work as he only worked around the corner at the time, roll on 3/4 months and his dad is working from home and so being good friends I offered to take him, that started in April 2017. The condition for taking him to work was he passes his driving test.

Now it's December 2018 and we've had a falling out because he just hasn't made a remote effort to learn to drive. Then to top it off acted like  it was my problem when I couldn't take him home due to collecting some car parts, (couldn't actually fit him in the car) and so had enough and told him that I'm no longer giving him lifts to and from work anymore, I feel bad because iknow he can't get to work but at the same time just feel like I've been used for the past year and 8 months.

My husband is currently at a job that has a union and really good health insurance. Right after I start working he wants to apply for a job at the same company. I asked him if he could wait until I qualified for insurance. Our youngest as a check up in February, I have 2 appointments in March and one of the reasons I haven't worked a lot lately is because of health issues so I would be a nervous wreck knowing our family of 4 would have no insurance.

0,"AITA for asking a guy how big his dick is after he asks how much I weigh? | So there's this guy in our friend group who asked me out on a date. Fast forward to the end of the date, and we're both too tired to engage in a heavy convo so we're just making small talk here and there, browsing through social media on our phones while occasionally sharing funny posts. I guess he's into fitness because he showed me an instagram post and it was a female weight lifter with a description including her weight, how much she's lifting etc. He said how amazing it was that a 48kg woman could deadlift xkg. (I forgot lol). I said yeah, it's cool, I don't think I could ever do that. Then he asked me how much I weigh.

It stunned me for a moment because while I believe yes, it's just a question, weight can be a sensitive topic for some and it made me really uncomfortable. I said ""excuse me?"". He repeated the question. I'm the kind of person who'd rather swallow my own discomfort for the sake of others'. I didn't want to make him feel bad for asking a question, so I answered it. But then he said ""you weigh more than me"".

I didn't know what to say to that. I know it wasn't what he said, but it sounded like he was saying I'm fat. I started to get angry about that last comment so I asked, ""What was the point of that question?"" and he said ""I was just curious. I mean, you're an ok weight for your height and age, I think. You aren't morbidly fat or anything."" I'm still stunned because his words were so harsh to my ears.

In the end, I told him that I didn't like how he asked such a what I consider personal, personal question. He started defending himself that it was ""just a question"" and that I shouldn't be like most girls in this generation. I asked what he meant, and he said being sensitive about ""a damn question"". Then he started on a rant about how girls are discriminatory towards guys with things they can't help like height, so why can't guys be discriminatory about their weights - something that they *can* help? What's up with this ""double standard""?

So I know for a fact (from all the teasing from the guys in our friend group) that he's insecure about his dick, so I tried to use that to show him my perspective. I said ""Okay if it's just a question. So, how big's your dick?"" He didn't respond but he became evidently embarrassed. ""Tell me, how big is it?"" He asked me to stop asking him. I complied, but I used that to try and get him to see my view. He seemed to understand, but he didn't apologise. We both went home our separate ways and on the way home, I received a lot of private messages from some of his mates in our friend group about how I was an overreacting bitch.

They said I was the bitch because while he didn't know how insecure I am about my weight, I knew how insecure he was about his dick size, and that I took complete advantage of that. I explained my side and what he said, yet they were still adamant in labelling me as the asshole. So. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for adopting a puppy when we were notified the foster wanted to adopt the puppy, we were notified after a week of adotion process | My fiancee, her son (9), and I just moved into a new house and finally have no restrictions on owning a dog.

We have applied for several puppies through a local rescue/adoption agency. After sending 8 or 10 applications for various puppies and being put on waitlists we finally got the call that we were set for an interview.

We had initially been second in line but something from the first interview didn't work out so we moved up to first in line the day after our application. We did an interview the next day and everything went well and the adoption coordinator said they would notify the foster home. The puppy had a final medical check for a small hip injury on the following Tuesday.

On Monday we got an email from the foster family to start the process of setting up a meet and greet.

Tuesday afternoon we got a call from the agency that the medical went well and the puppy is healthy. But they also told us that the foster was apparently interested in adopting the dog.

Typically the foster homes get first choice for adopting dogs they foster and the puppy should apparently never have been listed. The agency says they have bonded between the family and puppy. Because it was an error on the part of the agency and the puppy should never have been listed as available for adoptions, they have left the choice with us to either follow through and adopt the puppy or allow the foster family to keep the puppy.

We have been excited about this puppy since last Wednesday when we were first selected for an interview. Have already bought a collar and several toys for her and shown her to friends and family and told them we were in the process of adopting this beautiful puppy. Our nine year old son also loves the dog and is crushed by the news we may not get her now.

0,"AITA if I report an obviously photoshopped image to the realtor board? | A few months back I listed an end unit townhome for a young family.  The place was great but had one drawback - it was located next to a field that was the next stage for townhome development.  It was the reason some decided against even looking at it when they arrived.

Ultimately the family got frustrated as they cleaned up after their kids time and again only for people to cancel before they even got inside and they chose to blame me for people not knowing about this obvious defect that, ""you should handle before they even arrive"".  In the end we let the listing expire early.

A month or so goes by and then about a week ago I noticed the same townhome with a very obviously photoshopped photo of the front showing a road and nicely manicured field next to the end unit (trust me it's a muddy construction site).

This is obviously false advertising and the kind of stuff that lands those in my profession in hot water.  My question is this, WIBTA if I report this listing to the local board (the process is anonymous so no-one would know it was me)?

1,"AITA if I got mad at a close friend to help me with a legal matter and she refused because I didn't ""ask correctly?"" | A couple of months ago, I ran into some legal trouble, and I needed one of my incredible close friend's help to write me a letter of good character. I was still in a bit of shock from what happened, and I impulsively texted her out of the blue saying ""need you to draft a letter for me for good character. Need it by Friday thanks so much"" and she responded with ""you need to ask before you demand something of someone."" 

I immediately apologized with ""my bad I'm sorry. I still think you're the goat."" She agreed to write the letter, but kept on saying ""I'll write your letter today"" or ""I have an exam today/tomorrow but afterwards I'll write it."" She did this multiple times. She slowly stopped communicating, and the letter ended up never being written. She continued to post on all social media of her going out to bars/parties while not communicating with me whatsoever.

Eventually I reached out to one of our mutual friends to see what was going on. The mutual friend said that I never ""asked nor apologized correctly"" to the close friend. 

I ended up texting the close friend, saying ""I’m not mad but I’m pretty disappointed. I don’t mean to sound like a parent, but you really let me down with this letter. I understand that you’ve had exams, but you’ve also had two weeks notice. It takes maybe an hour out of your day to write this. If you were in my shoes and you asked me to write a letter, I would’ve dropped everything to do it.

1,"AITAH for not wanting to keep a puppy with a genetic disease that ended up dying yesterday? | Hi all, 
Before I get flamed, hear me out. My dog had puppies a few days ago. (It was an accidental breeding, we are getting the male fixed soon so it doesn’t happen again) 

She had one puppy that was born with a cleft palate. This puppy could not nurse on the mother because of this condition. We brought it to a 2 vet offices that were no help at all. They kept giving us the run around about its condition. The puppy could could not eat on its own, and required being fed every 2 hours through a feeding tube. My wife began feeding it at night, and I was supposed to feed it during the day. (I work from home, but I’m in sales, so I’m required to travel frequently during the day to meet with clients and give estimates on jobs. My schedule is unpredictable as I can be on call at any moment) 

Yesterday, my wife and I got into a huge fight about this puppy. She wanted to keep it and raise it. (We already have 3 dogs already, and they aren’t even receiving enough attention) I did NOT want another dog. The biggest reason was because I would be the one who would have to take care of this new puppy; potty training, feeding, taking it out, playing with it, etc. Since I “work from home” I would be responsible for the bulk of this work. I refused. I didn’t want to take on another puppy. I had to take care of our last 2 dogs from puppy hood, and it is HELL.

My wife wanted to keep this puppy. She was even looking into getting surgery for it, and spending thousands of dollars on this surgery. I did not want to spend all of this money for a puppy that I had no intention of keeping. I wanted to surrender this puppy to a dedicated rescue group who is specialized in treating puppies with this issue. It would receive around the clock care, and eventually be adopted out to a nice family. Every time we fed the puppy, the milk seemed to get pumped right out of its nose, like fluid was entering the puppies lungs. My guess is that it was developing pneumonia, but I’m no veterinarian. 

Sadly, the puppy died yesterday. I came home and found its stiff body. My wife blames me for the puppies death.... She says it’s my fault because I didn’t want to spend the money on getting the puppy help. The quote that we received from the vet required surgery, and costed thousands of dollars. It’s true, I didn’t want to spend all of the money that we have been working so hard to save up. But I also feel like we should have surrendered her to a rescue from the start, as we had no knowledge on how to properly care for a puppy with this condition. 

I got really upset that she blamed me for the puppies death. There was lots of yelling, and anger towards each other, and we aren’t speaking. 

Am I the asshole here??",False,False
1,"AITA for considering breaking up with my girlfriend because of her white hair dog? | We have been in a long distance relationship for about a year now. After her last visit to me her friend got her a husky mix to help her with depression (supposedly) without talking to my GF about it. That dog has white hair. I have an office job where I wear black pants to work everyday. I can pull out a clean pair of pants and if the dog rubs against me there is dog hair all over it. 

I am not against dogs. I have one myself and live with a family members dog as well. One is mine with short grey hair that does not show up on my clothes, the other is a small black dog that doesn't shed on me.

Also, my GF and I have been talking about moving in together. Rather then getting a place for 2 people and 1 dog, I will have to consider getting a place with a bigger yard to for 2 dogs to run in.

She has had the dog for about a month now. I don't feel it's right to tell her it's me or the dog as this is the 2nd dog she has had this year.

1,"AITA for taking long showers even though my therapist recommended them to me? | Lots of background here so I'll try to keep it simple. In late February I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and went for inpatient treatment for 3 weeks. Upon discharge I decided I'd move in with my parents in order to get my feed back under me (I'm 27). My mom was very happy to have me in the house. My dad was skeptical because he not so openly thinks I'm just ""lazy"" and I have 3 younger siblings who still live at home who I don't get along with at all.

One of my coping mechanisms I've learned is to accept the fact that I'm a nocturnal person so I don't even try to stay up during the day. The other thing I like to do is take a really, really long shower (30 minutes-1 hour) before I go to bed as it helps me with insomnia. My therapist said this is a great strategy and likes that I'm thinking creatively to solve my problems. 

So in my parents house I stay up all night and write (I'm a professional writer as my occupation) and I take a shower somewhere between 5 and 7. Well this has caused a melt down with my dad and siblings because they claim that I don't leave them any hot water. I know this is bull crap because there's still hot water when I get out of the shower. 

But even if I did use all the hot water, there's other things that can be done so we can all live here in peace. My siblings can shower in the gym at school and my dad can maybe look into getting a tankless heater for the house. I mean, the way I feel is this is just finger pointing at me when they know I've had medicallly diagnosed issues and a prescribed method of treatment to help me cope. If I were to have a septic wound that needed to be washed every morning, no one woukd be screaming at me with choice words like ""lazy fat pig."" I'm just taking a shower for the love of God.

But I need to be more open minded in my thinking so I'm asking here. Am I the asshole for taking long showers before I go to bed?",False,False
1,"AITA for taking leftovers home from a friend’s house? | A friend invited me over a while ago and said “It’s been a while, let me buy you dinner and we can catch up.”

She ordered us a large pizza and salad. We had a good time. Then it was time to go. She said she was buying me dinner, so I packed the leftovers up and took them home with me. 

Later the next day she texted me “Hey, did you see where the pizza ended up. Could’ve sworn I put it in the fridge but seriously can’t find it. worried (*her dog*) ate it, he doesn’t digest cheese well.” 

I told her I took it home and she asked if I took some of it or all of it and I said all of it. She asked why I didn’t leave her any and I said because she said she was buying me dinner. 

She said she bought me dinner for that night but intentionally bought a big pizza to have some left for the next day.

I told her she can easily afford another pizza if she wants one and I really didn’t understand what the big deal was since she offered to buy me dinner. 

This friend is much better off than I am money wise, she still has financial support from her parents and I do not. I feel like it was very entitled of her to invite me over for dinner and not let me take the rest home. Honestly, if I’d known she’d be that stingy, I would’ve made a point to eat it all there and then. 

But now it’s been a few weeks and things have noticeably cooled between us in what used to be a close friendship and I’m starting to worry. I asked a mutual friend if they knew and they said she was upset I never apologized over the leftovers thing and just how I handled the situation. 

She’s usually a very fair and level headed person and I am shocked she’s held onto this for this long. I’m starting to worry I misjudged things and am actually the asshole in this situation and am leading the demise of our relationship. AITA?",False,False

After i told her I wasn’t well off myself, she was having none of it and things took a turn when she suddenly started cursing me for being privileged and shit. After like half a minute of hearing that, i told her “ok I’ll swap the $5 for the $20 bill”, and she agreed and gave it back to me, at which point i told her “that was greedy, I didn’t like what you did, and now I’m not giving you anything” and i took off with her screaming at me.

0,"AITA for how I reacted to my friend telling me she wanted to get a mastectomy? | My friend’s mom was diagnosed with ovarian cancer 5 years ago. She had a hysterectomy and went through other treatments as well. 2 years later she got diagnosed with breast cancer, which made her get a double mastectomy. After that, she was cancer free. The breast cancer wasn’t a shock, however, because her mother had that same type of cancer and then her sister had it. 

As a result, my friend is obviously nervous about getting the cancer as well. Recently, she told me that she wanted to talk about something really big and I asked her what’s up. She told me that she wanted to get a double mastectomy and possibly a hysterectomy. She knew it would take away her chances of having kids biologically, but she’s watched what cancer has done to her family and she doesn’t want to go through it herself. I was supportive and told her I would back her up. The only thing I added was that because we were under 30, she might have trouble finding a doctor to perform the hysterectomy, but I’m sure she could find one.

She got a little quiet and then said “So, you’re not going to try to talk me out of it?” And I replied, “No, why would I?” She said that these were big choices and she thought I would “care more” that she would be forever altering her body. I just explained that I really understand why she’s making said choices and as her friend, I would support her. She said that this had been a big deal and she expected a bigger reaction. 

I started to get a little mad and asked if she wanted us to have a fight or something. She said “Well, I just expected more push back and you’re just sitting there, acting like I told you I wanted to get a boob job.”

Finally, I just told her “This isn’t a play, you can’t control how I talk. I was supportive and you’re somehow mad.”

I left where we were having coffee before she could make a scene. She later texted me and explained that it was just such an emotional choice for her and she thought I would be too.

25 years ago I was married to a rather old fashioned sort of man who wasn’t very kind. It was a tumultuous relationship and we ended up divorcing after a few years. He had a little girl that was 7 at the time of our divorce. We were exceedingly close at the time, and I honestly did love her then.

I never kept in touch with her, due to her father keeping her well away from me. In honesty, I wasn’t too fussed on keeping contact either as it just wasn’t the done thing at the time.

1,"AITA for not helping my wife fish out her tampon? | Obviously this post is a bit tmi but the title should forewarn of that.  The short of it is, my wife somehow got a tampon stuck inside her earlier this evening. I have no idea how this happened or even that it could happen, but you learn something new everyday. 

She got into a panic after apparently trying to get it out for an hour. She lays down on the bed, takes off her bottoms and asks me if I can try to grab it because my fingers are longer. 

I was totally caught off guard and froze up. I asked if she was sure she couldn’t get it out and she said yes. I guess I made a face or something because she actually started crying. I tried to calm her down but she told me to leave her alone and ended up driving herself to the clinic (which is like 5 minutes away).

I want to propose to him we use the office as a playroom but unfortunately this means the music stuff has to go. We have nowhere else to put this stuff as it does indeed take the room.

His face starts becoming more aggressive and he says ""I'm afraid you can't talk about those topics here"".

My friend asks why. He then says ""I'm afraid it's against school rules"" And so I ask which one. He doesn't respond. I ask again. He says ""You can look on our website"". My sister comes and says that she's ready. And he says, ""Looks like you can leave now!"" and then he walks away.

So I said my goodbyes to my friend and I return home. I tell my mother about the situation when she come home. She says that I shouldn't have talked about those topics in a school but I feel that since it was a conversation I was having with one person it shouldn't be a problem.

Later I looked at the schools Website and there's no mention about this 'rule'

0,"AITA for not standing up for my sister when our parents went no contact with her? | I (19F) have an older sister (27F). We come from a very religious family - no alcohol, no parties, no staying out late etc. I'm a university student. Our parents paid for my sister's bachelors, masters and is currently paying for her PhD as well. I'm in my 2nd year of university, and our parents are paying for my tuition as well. 

A while back, our parents saw photos of my sister drinking at bars with her friends and going to clubs. That made them rage. They've promised to stop paying my sister's fees, and haven't spoken to her in over a month. They have been paying for an apartment for her to stay in near her university so she doesn't need to stay in student accommodation and they didn't pay the rent for it this month. Now my sister is freaking out because she's realised our parents are being serious.

She's called me begging me to talk them out of it. The thing is, I know speaking up for her may very well mean I will get cut off too. Our parents are very headstrong, and if I say anything that does not support what they think or believe, even a simple ""how about we talk to sister some more?""  will be taken as I side with her. ""We've raised two heathens, Lord where have we gone wrong?"" And yes, they would absolutely use the word 'heathens'. 

She's pointed out that I also drink and go to clubs (without our parents knowledge of course) and that it's unfair that I will retain our parents goodwill when she doesn't.",False,False
1,"Aita for massaging my throat in front of my brother in law | Im a 33 year old autistic male and i have been living with my sister and her husband for a couple years and also working for my brother in law.  Over the time he has been annoyed by any stims i would do especially during work.  I would try very hard not to but its hard.  about 9 months ago i did a tifu when my throat was bothering me and trying to massage it i broke my hyoid bone.  Ive seen the doctor and as i can breath and swallow it's not a huge deal but it gets twisted and compresses a nerve and bothers me, so i have to manipulate the bone back in place every now and then.  For some reason my BIL cant stand when i do that and yells at me to stop.  I tell him i cant help it and he doesnt care it annoys him so i should stop.  I eventually snapped back and told him fuck you my neck isnt about you and now im being kicked out.

I love my job, they've said it's ok to say no, but it's also an important opportunity. The trip will happen 3 days before my official due date, so the baby could really drop at any minute, likely causing my pregnant wife some decent anxiety.

1,"AITA for being upset that my siblings are getting part of an inheritance but I’m not because I’m a recovering addict? | My parents are pretty wealthy. 

I’m 26 and from 21-25 I was in and out of rehabs. I was abusing so many different kinds of drugs and I wasted so much money. I OD’d once  and it destroyed my family to watch me go through that. 

I am intensely ashamed of who I was as a person and I have been sober for almost a year. 

My parents are now approaching their late 60s and have started finalizing their wills and inheritance. 

Yesterday they sat me down and told me that I will not be getting any of the inheritance as they don’t trust me not to relapse with all that money suddenly in my possession and as a result my siblings will be getting my share of the money. 

I was pretty upset about this and I said that they were going to make my siblings rich while I would get nothing from it and that wasn’t fair. I was almost yelling at this point. 

They told me to calm down but I was too upset to listen and I left. I called my brother and sister after I left and told them what my parents said and they said that it was their choice and there wasn’t anything they could do. 

I accused them of just wanted all the money for themselves and not caring about what happened to me. 

Today I have my dad texting me that they are worried about me and “disappointed in my behaviour yesterday.” I talked to my sponsor and he said that while anger is understandable, I have to do everything in my power not to ruin the trust I’ve built with my family over the past year and acting like an asshole addict won’t help. 
Sometimes I still have trouble with my reactions to things now that I’m sober however I don’t feel as though I’m entirely unjustified here.

2 weeks ago something happened at work and I was going back home at 3 am. I saw my car’s son on the side of the road,it was basically middle of nowhere, there are only woods there.

Our waitress was very friendly to my bf and was kinda disregarding me and started off by saying ""what can I get for you babe?"" to my bf he said he didn't realize and just went with the flow. That kinda threw me off, but then she complimented his outfit, and said I was really lucky. Yeah thanks girl I know, thats why I'm with him. And she kept on putting her hand on his shoulder and making jokes, he even told me it was kinda weird but that she's just being friendly. On the way to the washroom I stopped by her while she was using the POS machine and I confronted her about it and told her that flirting with another girls bf right in front of her is not cool.

0,"AITA for being angry over promised stroller after miscarriage? | Okay long story but I’ll keep it short. 

Back when Toys R Us went bankrupt my husband and I went to go look and see what stuff was on sale. We bought a few things but more specifically bought a pretty expensive stroller that was like 75% off even though we had no kids at the moment. We had been talking and making plans to hopefully get pregnant in the next year or two and we both conceded that buying the stroller was a good option. 

Fast forward a few months and I found out I was pregnant. I was super excited and happy but he immediately acted a little off. We talked and he said he wasn’t excited about the timing but happy to have a baby. We told our friends and family and shortly after I had a miscarriage. 

It’s been approximately 7 months since the miscarriage. We still have the stroller and it’s sitting in the closet. Yesterday would have been my due date. We were at a party and some guy who knocked up his gf, who we know but aren’t friends with, was at the party. All of a sudden my husband yells across the room in front of 15-20 people “HEY CAN WE GIVE THEM THE STROLLER? WE HAVE NO USE FOR IT SO WE MIGHT AS WELL” I didn’t want to be seen as a major bitch so I simply said yes. 

Well today we got into a huge fight about it. Not only did he put me in the spot by not consulting with me but I feel like he’s completely disregarding everything we had talked about previously. It’s like he’s completely oblivious to the fact that one, I kept the stroller because I’m hoping to put a baby in it soon, and two he doesn’t care about how I feel during this time. 

I blew up and told him I felt like he didn’t care, he stayed silent the whole car ride, walked inside the door and immediately headed for his PC and didn’t event apologize. Am I being an asshole and over reacting here or is he being a fucking douche? ",False,False

He showed me messages confirming he’d stopped seeing this woman, but he could just be pretending. Part of me wanted to tell my mum but I also know it would hurt her a lot and probably split up our family so I’ve said I wont say anything.

1,"AITA for not serving someone with ID because I though they looked young? | I am a bartender in Aus and one night the group of 4 come up and one of them looks about 14, so I ask for ID and looks legit and all and says he is 19 (For you Americans the drinking age is 18 in Aus) I study the ID for a while trying to find any mistake or whatever because I don’t feel comfortable serving someone who looks 14. I can’t find anything and ask him his date of birth. (Some people with fake ID’s are idiots and don’t even remember the date of birth of their ID) he responds correctly and I say well I’m not serving you because sorry you just look too young. 

Now this is where I’m wondering whether I’m an arsehole. He proceeds to say yeah I look young that’s because I have Kallman Syndrome (Disease that makes you not go through puberty and in turn make you look very young) I’ve never heard of this and think it is bullshit so I just say no sorry I’m not serving you. He gets out his phone and shows me that it is an actual disease but I just hold my ground and say no.

1,"AITA For telling my adopted ""brother"" that hes not part of our family, after he demanded a position in the family business? | I run a medium sized chain of local gyms that I started with my father in 2002. Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.

I like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.

However, I also have another, unofficially adopted ""brother"" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.

The story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.

He was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.

Hes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. 

I dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.

He is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.

Hes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.

He flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA if I refuse to share my Disney+ account with my SO? | My LTLD girlfriend doesn’t like Disney as a company. She finds most of the Marvel movies to be repetitive (though she likes Avengers) and doesn’t agree with Disney’s monopoly + influence. So, when Disney+ came out, she wasn’t interested at all in giving them any of her money. 

I, on the other hand, really enjoy the Disney Marvel universe and watch nearly all the shows and movies associated with it so I ended up purchasing the subscription. 

I told her about the subscription I had and she jokingly said “Lemme in on your account”. I said no because she said she hated Disney and I find it hypocritical that she wants to use my account. She said she shits on the company and  doesn’t want to give them money but enjoys the older stuff they’ve put out.

1,"AITA for calling my friend at work and pretending to be her sister after being ignored for over two months? | So I (21F) have been best friends with Nina (21F) since the sixth grade. We hung out all the time, watched movies, came over to each others' house, and she even met my grandma after trying to steal a pair of my pants. Our friendship has been solid for over ten years, despite growing, we still come back to each other. Usually, we'd interact often throughout the day but in November, I started getting left on delivered (like being left on read, but the read receipts aren't on; more insidious imo) more and more often, and on the rare chance that she would respond, it would be one word answers. I was increasingly concerned because her social media was barren, which was unusual. She struggles with mental health issues that are currently untreated due to her financial situation. She can isolate herself when she's feeling down, but my friends and I intervene and help her when it happens.

So in the middle of December, she texted our group chat and asked us to go out to dinner to catch up. Of course I was in there like swimwear, but when I got there she was making next to no eye-contact with me, barely talking, and not laughing at my jokes all while literally sitting next to me. Fast-forward two weeks, I'm still texting her every day or so and still being ignored. Later, I broke up with my long-term bf. It hurt as we were gearing up to move out together and I reached out to her and got silence. This hurt as every time she'd have a break up or a guy problem, it was me who'd get the call at 12 or 1 in the morning (the sadboi hours, as you may already know) and be with her. But when I finally need her? Silence. I later saw on a mutual friend's instagram post her living it up at a NYE party. I was enraged.

Yesterday, I lost it. I went over to her house and knocked on the door, and a male relative answered and told me she wasn't home. I went home and called her job. It rang and her coworker picked up, and I asked to talk to her. She asked me who I was and I said ""her sister"". So the call was transferred to Nina, and I was like ""it's not your sister, it's me, why are you avoiding me"" and I cried on the phone. She was upset and said ""you can't call me at work for this, it isn't that important, I could have gotten in trouble"" and hung up. 

About 20 minutes later, she texted the group chat (SHE FOUND THE TIME) and we ended up arguing. She told us that she wasn't ignoring anyone, but busy but I countered and said ""you weren't too busy to party"". I then said ""I'm mad that you haven't made the time for us"", and then she left the group chat. Now Reddit, I had a moment of pettiness and added her back in the group chat. I said ""You left because you know I'm right. Something is up and we're being ignored. If you really want to make time for someone, you will, and I see we weren't worth it"". Then she left the group chat again, and I didn't add her back.

1,"AITA For letting my dogs on the couch at an Airbnb and WIBTA for leaving a bad review? | Hi everyone, I stayed at an Airbnb that is pet friendly (dog bowls included) but strictly has a no pets on the couch rule advertised. They say they will charge $60 per hour for deep cleaning if they find it's been broken. Here is my argument, the living room is maybe 300 square feet and the couch is a HUGE sectionional. There is a small piece of living room in front of the couch filled with a huge coffee table. There is barely any room in the apartment besides the couch. It is not practical to keep two dogs off the couch the entire trip, especially when we are out of the unit as there is almost nowhere else to go. 

The sectional is so big I can't even cover it all with a blanket. I covered two sections with a blanket the best I could. Anyway, the place was in perfect condition besides some dog hair on the couch which I vacuumed before leaving. After the trip, the host says they found dog hair on the couch and will charge for deep cleaning. I tell them it's not a fair rule because in a small apartment it's impossible to keep two dogs off the couch.  They need a smaller couch so there is room for dogs or a cover that can be used. 

I agreed to the rule as stated and knew about it in advance, but I did not know the size of the sectional. I literally don't know how I could keep both dogs off the couch when I left the apartment. They would both basically have to stay in the same spot on the ground by the entrance and not move. I tried my best to cover it and when I was home I wouldn't let them stay on it, but of course they would try to jump up sometimes. 

Please note there was NO damage or issue, only dog hairs which I had already vacuumed. Am I the asshole for letting them on the couch and would I be the asshole for leaving a bad review?",False,False

1,"AITA for not believing in the things my GF does | Obligatory on mobile so sorry for any typos, wall of text Inc. 

Scene fades in...
So I've been together with my SO for more than 3 years now. And even way back in the beginning I let her know that I am a skeptic and I don't believe in any religions life after death spiritual stuff.
She has recently started doing yoga and through this has advanced her spirituality to the point where she bought a pack of tarot cards to help guide her life, same with a crystal pendulum she got from her dad that she claims can also show her what to so in tough situations.

Now I've never confronted her about this, I live and let live, but after she got tarot pack and asked me to draw a card from it I did and just snickered. Afterwards she confronted me asking why I don't believe in anything she does. And that if I don't have faith in the things she does then I am basically not having faith in her, also if I think what she does is dumb then I consequently also think she is dumb as well. Which I absolutely don't she is very intelligent, but is quick to believe in new things with 0 evidence. 

And now we're in this huge fight because of this, basically it bolied down to me not living her if I don't believe all this. When I just want her to question a bit more instead of accepting every thing at face value, and leveling up from this basic spiri stuff to faith healing and calling on angelic energies and shit.

1,"AITA for dancing too well at a wedding? | Using a throwaway because I’m a semi-public figure in my local salsa scene and I want to be as anonymous as possible.

My wife (34F) and I (45M) are both salsa fanatics. We met 9 years ago at a salsa workshop and have since become partners in life and dance, so to speak. We have won several local salsa competitions and are active in the salsa community. When we go to parties and weddings we like to perform a salsa routine because it livens up the mood and people seem to like it. We have never had any complaints and people always treat it as a delightful surprise. 

My coworker at my day job Dave (31M) got married this weekend. Of course, at the reception I discretely asked the DJ to play my favorite song to dance to, and  as soon as it started playing my wife and I began our routine. We got a lot of positive attention and at the end everyone clapped for our performance. I didn’t see Dave or his wife but I figured they wouldn’t mind that my wife and I were enjoying ourselves and celebrating the occasion. However, later that night Dave told me that he thought our dance was a “dick move” and accused me of showing off and trying to make the wedding about me. I told him that was never my intention. Someone else stole him away to congratulate him and I assumed everything was okay. However, this week at my day job Dave has been ignoring me and passive aggressive. Everyone else at work has said that they liked our dance and thought Dave was making a big deal out of nothing. However, I’m starting to question our tradition of performing a salsa routine at weddings. I think it might cause too much drama.

0,"AITA for wearing perfume around a chain smoker? | For backstory, I grew up with an asthmatic mother  who never allowed scented soaps, cleaners, perfumes, or candles. Now I live across the country with my SO and both of us love scented things, but I’ve always remained careful about perfumes until my SIL sent me a bunch of samples for higher-end perfumes and I fell in love with one of them and started wearing it everyday. I don’t douse myself in it, I just spray it on one wrist, touch my wrists together then touch my wrists to my neck.

So today I get to work and one of the other managers comes into my office, then pauses and asks if I’m wearing perfume and I respond that I am, then she gives me a look and says “I can’t be around perfume, I have asthma” And quickly rushes out of my office. 
My first reaction was worry, but it vanished a second later because I immediately remembered that she (and all of her team members) are heavy chain smokers. I know because their two favorite smoking spots are by my office window and in front of the doors to my job. 
My boss wears perfume, other coworkers wear perfume, our customers wear perfume and cologne, it’s never been a problem until now. I understand having asthma only or easily triggered by certain things but it really seems like BS to me, and if I have to walk through cigarette smoke while entering and leaving the building then I’ll continue to wear it.

1,"AITA For Advising My Boyfriend to Not Tip Our Waitress? | So this morning, my boyfriend and I decide to go to Waffle House before I need to go in for work at my store nearby. He had just gotten paid and we like to give ourselves a little treat on payday. I'm not sure how most Waffle Houses are, as I've only ever been to this one, but this one is usually a place where you wait for a hostess to seat you as it tends to get very busy. The only exception I've seen is when my boyfriend and I went late, after my closing shift, and there were no other customers in the restaurant.

So when we see it's packed, we take a seat where customers are supposed to wait until a table opens up. We are kept waiting several minutes after a table is cleaned and opened and another, larger, group had seated themselves. To make it worse, we heard the staff tell that group we had been there first. So me my boyfriend are kind of miffed already by this.

Then one of the waitresses/hostesses notices us still sitting there and asks, ""Are y'all waiting to be seated?"" We answer that yes, we are. Now we are even more unhappy because that was obviously what we were doing and y'all had shown you were aware of us from the moment we sat down to wait.

She then says, ""Oh, well you don't need to wait on us; just sit wherever!"" We hadn't done that for fear of getting lost in all the business, each waitress thinking we were someone else's customer. But, when they assured that wouldn't happen if we chose our own seats after we explained our reasoning, we chose the booth that had been open for nearly ten minutes.

When a waitress comes around to us shortly after, it's the same lady who told us to find our own table. Almost right away, I notice she's being weird. She won't look at me or talk to me until absolutely necessary and won't stop looking at my boyfriend until she needs to speak to me. She also asks my boyfriend if he wants separate checks before asking if we want anything to drink twice. She asks that twice when I know for a fact she knows we're an item because we were hugging and cuddling nonstop while we waited.

I don't know if I'm being too sensitive or what, but that really rubbed me the wrong way and my boyfriend told me it made him uncomfortable as well. I suggested he doesn't tip her because of this behavior. But now that it's been a couple hours, I feel bad and conflicted. I still don't think she earned a tip but I know waitresses need all the tips they can get! It's how they survive... So, am I an asshole?",False,False

1,"AITA for refusing to get my husband food from the store? | I’m going to make this short, mainly because it’s fucking ridiculous this is even an issue. I went grocery shopping this morning and spent over $100 on groceries for the week. My household consists of myself (24f), my husband (26m), and our daughter (4mo). I don’t buy many snacks because my husband works and I’m a SAHM, and he usually only eats one large helping of dinner while he’s at work since he sleeps in as long as possible. So the fridge has food in it. 

Fast forwards to just now, I was sort of hungry, but not enough to cook a whole meal and decided I would go get some sushi as a snack from the store. It costs like $7, I was going to hold me until I start dinner probably around 7 or so. I announced my plans as I picked up my keys, and my husband asked if I would bring him back something also. I said sure and asked what he wanted. He asked if I would bring back hot wings and an oven pizza. I told him to pick something else, something smaller, and he demanded to know why. I said bc I just spent $100+ on groceries: if he wants a meal there’s food in the kitchen. I’m just going to grand a small snack - my item will be $7, his would be $15+, and it’s not like we’re rolling in money - we live paycheck to paycheck, and there’s been several times where we have no food at the end of the month while we wait for the next payday. 

Anyway, he gets pissy and says he doesn’t say that to me when he goes to pick up McDonald’s or something for us. I said yes, but in that situation we’re getting the same amount of food for the same amount of money, when there’s no other food around. We have food, I’m just getting a snack. I can get pizza and hot wings the next time I go grocery shopping, though. 

Well he goes off. Starts saying that I’m calling him fat and I’m being a hypocrite and it’s okay for me to go get myself sushi and he can’t get what he wanted. I tried to re-explain but it’s like he was only hearing what he wanted to hear. I got so fed up I just walked outside to cool off. I feel like I was being fair, am I the asshole here?",False,False

They divorced after this and my brother started a new relationship with this man. This was three years ago and now Chris is marrying this same guy.

The thing is, I’ve been witness to the devastation that this caused to his ex wife and son. He still is around for his son, but starting a life with a woman when he never was interested in women is something I’ll never understand. It’s not as if any of us would judge him for being gay. I’ve tried to help out with my nephew when I can so I’ve seen the confusion it’s caused him and the hurt it caused his ex, one of the kindest people I know. 

Now that he’s getting married again, the invitations have gone out and I’m invited. 

I really don’t feel like celebrating the harm that he caused his family by going to his wedding. 

I called him when I got the invitation and explained this to him and he started crying and saying that I wasn’t being fair and that he wants me to be there. 

I just explained that I couldn’t be there after everything that happened and I hung up. 

My sister called me and said that I was being an unfair dick and that I need to apologize to Chris and plan to be at the wedding. I told her what I told him.

1,"AITA for eating Chick-Fil-A in the car? | Yesterday, me and my girlfriend's dad went out to shovel some people's driveways. He had mentioned that it's something he does this time of year to make some extra cash and I volunteered to help him today since he's not really a big fan of mine and I've been looking for a way to prove that I'm a good guy who'll treat his daughter right. We both went out in his truck and we spent a couple of hours going around a nearby neighborhood and shoveling snow off of driveways.

Things went good on the work aspect, but things went bad when we stopped for lunch. He did drive-thru for Chick-Fil-A and he pulled up to the speaker and asked for two meals with two bottles of water. I told him that I wanted a soda, but he starts yelling at me that I'm getting water because he doesn't want to spend the extra money for a fountain drink. I just sat back and shut up so that I couldn't be yelled at again. We got our food and he told me not to eat any in the truck since we'd be home soon. I was starving and I really was resisting the temptation to try and sneak a waffle fry while he wasn't looking. We reached a point where he was looking into his side-view mirror and I quickly snuck a waffle fry, but he saw me. He looked over to me with a pissed off look on his face, but he was also distracted and he had to slam on his brakes to avoid rear-ending the car in front of him. Our food went spilling all over his floor and he yelled ""YOU MOTHERFUCKER!"" He started yelling at me to get out of his truck, but I stayed behind to try and grab my sandwich. He snatches it from me and tosses it out the window and he yells at me to get out again. I get out and he yells at me to walk home and he drives off.

I just called my girlfriend and had her come pick me up and she wasn't happy with her dad. She said that she'll try and talk to him about what happened. I just hope that there's nothing in this story that would make my girlfriend consider breaking up with me. I don't see that I'm at fault by that much.",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting my baby anywhere near my MIL? | I(25F) and my husband(27M) have recently had a baby(3months M) and he is the light of our lives. My MIL has offered to watch him and do some responsibilities while my husband is at work and while I rest/go back to work in a few more weeks. I don’t want her near our kid because of COVIS-19, it isn’t prominent in our area but there has been a confirmed case(they’re in quarantine but still). I kinda just want to find a reputable daycare or home daycare when I go back to work and just be done with it. I don’t have anything wrong with my MIL, she isn’t you’re typical monster in law, but I’m kinda on the fence and since my baby came from me I feel like I can say who does or doesn’t watch him.

His ex/baby mom hates me and she makes it no secret. His daughter who’s 12 has been living with us this summer, and she told me a couple days ago she wanted a nose piercing from me for her birthday. I asked my boyfriend & he said he didn’t care and it was fine so I took her this afternoon to get one. Well, she texted a selfie of it to her mother and within minutes I got a call from her mom who was furious. She asked me how I dared not ask her permission, and I told her that I asked her father and I thought that was enough. She went off on me for a few minutes then finally hung up. I really can’t see why she would be so upset other then a personal vendetta against me, because I feel I did nothing wrong. I asked her father and I didn’t  think her mothers “yes” meant any more.

0,"AITA for cancelling a plan with my sister because she takes 40 mins to decide where she wants to eat? | English isn't my first language* beg your pardon!

I have a step sister and we used to hang out pretty often.
Back then, we were both kids and we didn't do much. But now we are adults. We have money, car and too many options now. That's when things started to get annoying.

My sister is 21 and she's pretty pretentious. Instagram is important to her and she MUST go to somewhere nice so that she can post. And I don't do Instagram so I kinda don't understand why is this important. 

And this just happened yesterday. So the night before, she said she wants to go somewhere nice. We agreed to get ready and leave our house by (tomorrow) 1pm. At 1pm, when both of us were ready, I told her ""hey so these are the places I looked up last night. Do you wanna go here?"" And she said she doesn't want to go there (anywhere I've found) and told me she will to look up now. (By the way, we were planning to go to a district(?) with many cute cafes and she couldn't decide which one to go in that area)


And she took AT LEAST 40 mins to decide where she wants to go. Guess what. It was one of the places I showed her at first. During the 40 mins, I was begging her just to pick anywhere. Then I told her that I'm not in a mood and she can go by herself.
She's so mad because I ruined her plan and says ""I should've told her earlier if I were to call it off"".

My other Instagram-famous friend thinks it's just because I don't understand her and the Instagram life. She says she also takes hours to decide where to go and what to wear. She thinks my sister deserves to be ""little upset"" at me. And my other friends think ""40 mins is too much"" and I deserve to be mad at her. AITA for cancelling a plan with my sister?",False,False
0,"AITA for asking parents to turn down their kids devices? | Was at a restaurant with a friend this evening, a moderately-priced sushi place. It was pretty busy and we were seated next to a table of 10. Grandma, grandpa, a few other adults, mom, dad, and three kids. All three of the kids were set up in front of their iPads with the volume blasting from each one of them. The restaurant was already playing music and it became cacophonous between the music, conversation and whatever the kids were watching. I tried ignoring it, but I lost my patience once the food came. 
I got up and asked dad, who was closest, If the kids could turn the volume down or put on headphones because the sound was disturbing my dinner. Dad looked at me like I had six heads and told me no, that he’s enjoying his dinner too and no one else had complained so it was fine in his book. I told him, “well, I’m complaining now. The sound is really disruptive.” Meanwhile the kids are starting to whine, saying they wanted to watch their videos. He refused again. I threw my hands in the air and wound up asking a server to move us. Could still hear their iPads and other people were giving them dirty looks. Dad kept looking at me and glaring.

0,"AITA For not going to Church with my wife | So a little backstory, my wife is very religious and I am an atheist. We have two kids together and our marriage is wonderful.

We have struggled with the above however since day 1. She has always had trouble knowing I was an atheist. I have always told her I would never let it affect anything and I respect her beliefs (as I hope she does mine).

Our kids go to church with my wife every weekend (which I am totally fine with). I think church has a lot of benefits and have no issue with my kids going. I stay at home every weekend as it isn't my thing and I don't believe in it.

This has been going on for about 3-4 years without argument.

Yesterday, she just lost it on me for not going to church with her family saying ""it doesn't matter if you don't believe in God, just go for our kids and for my family"" and ""sit there and think it is all bullshit, just go with me""

She was clearly very upset with it and I still refused to go as I don't believe in it.

Am I being the asshole here? Should I suck it up and go with her every weekend even though it is against my beliefs?

EDIT: This is a side note and may not be relevant but I am black and my wife is white and we live in an area with very few black people and that always causes us to get looks or people act like they have never seen a black guy before (I am 6'6"") and it makes me feel uncomfortable. ",False,False
1,"AITA for canceling the babysitter so my husband has to stay home with the kids? | A while back me and the husband were invited to a party for a friend of mine. We had the next door neighbor’s 13 year old daughter lined up to watch the kids (we have 5 boys). It would have been her first time with all of them. Originally, her parents (and our good friends) had plans but would be home shortly after we left to help her out if needed. 

This past Wednesday her dad got into some big trouble and ended up in jail. We have been supporting his wife and daughter with dinner for the past few nights, and my husband and I both did not go to work on Thursday following the incident to watch their dog and be there for support. 

I wrongly assumed it was understood that she would be not obligated to babysit this Saturday (today) because of the stress going on. She offered to still watch the kids, but I told her not to worry about it and I would get ahold of her later in the week for a date night (we share custody of our older boys and so later in the week it would just be our two younger boys—more manageable). 

Last night we had some friends over and I said something about going to the party for a couple hours while he stayed home with the kids. He had no idea I had cancelled the sitter and was upset that I wanted to still go by myself. I realize that I should have talked to him first, but I didn’t realize it would be that big of a deal to him since it was my friend’s party, and he doesn’t particularly like her. 

For context and to try and be neutral, him and I don’t get out much alone, so I know he’s disappointed, but I feel like there should be some understanding given the situation.

0,"AITA for not taking on my fiancé's speeding ticket? | My fiancé and I are both insured on my car. Earlier this week, he was flashed by a speed camera and today the penalty notice came through addressed to me. 

He has previously had many speeding tickets and a driving ban (this was due to a confusing insurance issue, we'd been told he was ok to drive my car because of his fully comprehensive insurance, but he actually wasn't, so he was banned for 3 months) since we have been together. However these were all a few years ago and have been wiped off his record, so he now has a clean licence again. I have never had a speeding ticket, so I have a totally clean license.

In the UK, if you're caught speeding for the first time, you are offered a 'speed awareness course' which is basically a 4 hour seminar about driving safely, and you get a fine of £100. The benefit of this is that you avoid having 3 penalty points added to your licence. He has been on a speed awareness course in the past, so this option is no longer available to him.

If I declare to the police that he was the driver, not me, he would receive 3 penalty points on his licence and the £100 fine. He has just bought a new car, and he would therefore need to tell his insurer about the 3 new penalty points, which would push his premium up by about £200 a year, which is admittedly quite a lot.

He has asked that I tell the police that it was me driving, so that I go on the speed awareness course, and he will pay ""my"" £100 fine. This way, he retains his clean licence, I retain my clean licence, I have to sit through 4 hours of speeding chat, he pays £100, and his insurance remains unchanged.

However, I feel uncomfortable that he has asked me to do this. Not only would we be lying to the police, it would then remove my ability to go on a speed awareness course in the future if I was ever caught speeding. In my opinion, it is totally his fault that he was caught speeding yet again, and therefore it should be his responsibility to suck up the penalty points and pay more for his insurance.

I have told him that I don't want to do it, and he has said that's fine. However, I now feel slightly guilty that he'll be absorbing this extra cost when I could hypothetically sit through a 4 hour seminar and make it all go away. And he obviously hoped that I would agree to do so, otherwise he wouldn't have asked. But ultimately I don't think it's my responsibility to do so, and I think it's unfair that he has put me in this position.  

My fiancé doesn't think I'm an asshole for refusing, but it's now it's in my hands whether he suffers the consequences or not, and it would be ""easy"" for me to sort this out. Reddit, AITA?",False,False

Lately she’s been showing me various tattoos from Pinterest and Instagram. I haven’t been very responsive to the things she shows me. She asked me what my issue was and I told her my stance on tattoos. She rolled her eyes and said that the ones on her ribs weren’t a problem but now that she wants more, I’m being a crybaby.

I told her to cool it, and that she’s ignorant to bash his cross tattoo when her flowers and butterflies and cursive won’t withstand 45 years of changes either.

1,"AITA For Not Wanting to Attend My Younger Brother's Wedding? | Sorry if this possibly belongs in /relationshipadvice, but I'm genuinely concerned about making an asshole move here and need some outside perspective to set me straight.

My (29m) younger brother (21m) is getting married this December and I have no interest in attending.

For context, we have no ongoing feud and never have had a ""negative"" relationship, just a rather absent one. I'm one of his two brothers, but our oldest brother has severe drug addiction problems, psychosis issues and has been excommunicated from the family for about 8 years, so long story short, I'm his only brother.

I've been away from home (out of state) since I was 20 and have only seen him about once/year since that point, along with the rest of my family. We dont talk/text in any capacity, although I tried very hard to kindle communications with him a few months ago when I moved closer to home (5hr drive), but he didnt have interest.

He started dating his first girlfriend 2 years ago and proposed at the beginning of 2019. Ive never met this girl and actually couldn't even tell you her name right now without checking Facebook. I only ever found out they were dating because my mother mentioned it and I only discovered they were engaged because of a Facebook post (and my mom text me).

I received a wedding invitation earlier this month. As expected, I'm not a groomsman in the wedding. That's to be expected at this point, I suppose. Point being is that I'm not going to be ruining what he has planned for the ceremony by not being there.

1,"AITA for yelling at a dental receptionist for canceling my appointment after waiting for so long? | This happened last week. I waited since 8:15 am to go to my dentist appointment that was scheduled at 8:30 am. I needed to get my filling done. I had the day off so I didn't mind waiting but when I looked at the clock and it was 9:20 am I got irritated. 


I went up to the receptionist and asked her how much longer and she said I was next to be called back. Someone came in, had some kind of urgent need and they got called back before I did. It was 9:35 am and I sadly went into asshole mode. I told the receptionist why would I get scheduled at a certain time if I had to wait so long. She told me the emergency plus the scheduled visits that day that I couldn't be seen that day. She offered to reschedule this week. 

I lost my cool and I kept telling her I wanted a refund on my copay since they canceled on me. I rose my voice some at the poor lady before leaving and posting a 1-star review on the survey they sent out. I have an appointment tomorrow and i'm afraid to go ",False,False
1,"AITA for still bringing up an old grudge against my in-laws after more than a decade? | My MIL is big on family tradition and has professional family portraits taken every holiday season. This year's photos just came back and my MIL was sharing the album at a birthday party this weekend with extended family and friends. The discussion came around to my wife and I and how long we've been together and someone noticed I wasn't in photos that I should have been and asked about it and my MIL went silent. 

See, I wasn't included in these portraits for a number of years because ""only family"" could be in the photos. Since my wife and i were ""only dating"", they felt I shouldn't be in the portraits because it ""probably wouldn't work out.""

My wife and I met in college and dated thru school and had a relatively long engagement as we got on our feet so we were together almost 7 years before our wedding. Despite all our time together, and my wife begging each year, my MIL and SILs insisted that I shouldn't be in the portraits until we said our vows, even the fucking year before our wedding despite the date set and save-the-dates sent. And honestly, it always hurt and was like a yearly reminder that I wasn't truly ""family"" to them. 

The real kicker to me though is that my MIL and SILs were all married and since divorced in that time, one of my SIL twice! So all these photos that I wasn't worthy to be part of include men that are not only *not* a part of the family anymore, but 2 were really assholes and all three of my SILs marriages were short-lived relationships and ended in messy divorces on really bad terms. But me, who is still here and the other half of the only long lasting and successful relationship of my wife's immediate family, was not included in this tradition for nearly a decade. 

So anyway, I started laughing when the question came up and went over the story and pointed out how all these jerks are in the photos but I wasn't allowed. And I apparently took a bit of joy in the fact that since my MIL and SILs pretty much hate those men now, the portraits are kind of useless and stay locked in a cabinet all year because of it. (It used to practically be a coffee table book) 

Well, my MIL started crying, my SILs were offended at my portrayals of their marriages, and everyone else who didn't see the humor was pretty much upset at me for calling them out for their unfair practices. 

I felt like I acted fairly at the time by just pointing out how the tradition backfired but my wife mentioned that I still get pissy each year over the photos and always have something snarky to say and it's long past time I let it go. Maybe she's right, she usually is, but I can't tell you how irked I get every time that damn album comes out.

1,"AITA for only giving myself credit when I gave my speech for ''Most Improved Student''? | So I (19M) am bringing something up that happened last year.

I live in the UK and go to University of Cambridge. This is tied with Oxford as the #1 university in the country, and is extremely prestigious. Unlike the US, which has heavy focus on extra-curricular, in the UK they don't matter anywhere near as much. Mostly its just grades and application.

So I've finished my first year at Cambridge. All this stuff happened **last year, while I was still in school (Sixth Form).**

I've always been the underachiever, even though I had lots of potential. Well something lit a fire under me and I decided to fulfil my potential. I knew I could do so much better than the average grades I was pulling. 

I asked my teachers for my A-Levels whether they'd help me out, and they knew my potential so obliged. They took 2 hours of their own time, for 5 days a week, to stay after school and tutor me for FREE. They gave me that initial push. I studied hard most days, including during breaks.

When I got my A-Level grades, I did amazing. I was accepted into Cambridge. I was estatic. 

My Sixth Form had a ''leavers'' type assembly where we all gave awards to each other. The other classmates and teachers agreed that I was the ''Most Improved Student''. We all gave speeches after.

Well when I went to accept the award, with my parents, teachers and other classmates looking at me, I said:

''Thank you all for this award. It's been a crazy year, and for the most part, I thank myself. I knew what I was capable of all along...and I did this myself. I realized all along, that I was capabe of achieving something great. Thank you all.''

People awkwardly clapped and my teachers looked really upset. My friend (18 at the time, now 19. Male) came up to me and said ''Dude what the fuck? You know you got a lot of help for this. Why didn't you thank them too?''. 

Deep down I felt a bit shit, but this was *my* moment, and I really wanted it. I told my friend that I'm leaving. That was the last time I ever saw those teachers. Sometimes I feel a bit bad deep down, but I also feel that I finally got *my* moment. I do think that I deserve most of the credit for what I did. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for not bothering to send my sons stepsiblings Xmas presents? | I’m 50 something years old, basically an old fart. I had a surprise kid with my ex 12 years ago, never planned for or wanted children (and yes, we used protection) but my son is a grand little kid and I’m very glad I got to be a dad. 

I broke up with my ex when I found out she was pregnant because she wasn’t sure who the father of my son was. A prenatal paternity test confirmed I was his father but obviously I didn’t fancy carrying on a relationship with his mother so we went our separate ways. 

My son has some half siblings as well as step siblings from his mums current relationship. I’ve met these kids once or twice but I couldn’t pick them out of a line up and don’t know anything about them, not even their names. My son doesn’t talk about them when he’s with me and I don’t ask. 

I spoke with his mum recently because I’m planning to get my boy a quad bike for Xmas, along with one for myself so we can ruck about on my land. I thought I might as well ask her in case she had an issue with it because it’s a fairly big gift. She hesitated and asked if I was planning to get my son a gift that big if I would consider getting his siblings something like a couple of Nintendo switches just so they didn’t feel left out. 

I’ve thought about it but I don’t want to spend my money on someone else’s kids so I’ve decided I won’t be buying them anything.

Found out within the past week she is entertaining attention from a man outside her marriage. Idk the extent of this relationship but this is not the first time she's ""talked"" to men outside her marriage. 

This her 4th marriage and there is a pattern with her actions when it comes to relationships. Once the ""new & exciting"" wears off, she goes seeking attention from men. 14 mths ago she spoke to me regarding a situation exactly like this, she was ""talking"" to a new person & wanted my opinion. I told her then that she needs to take a look inside herself & try to find out why she can't find & maintain some level of happiness with her husband. I also stated she must realize she has a good man at home and be happy.

0,"AITA for growing a beard | So I work at a restaurant that is somewhat corporate. Until around January of this year the dress code said all men who've work there had to be clean shaven, they recently changed it allowing facial hair. This was a very public thing that and corporate came down to ""explain"" the new dress code. The beard thing was pretty much just mentioned because most of the changes were for women's uniforms and I work with mostly women. So I decided to grow a beard and was told about a week later that the only beards allowed were filled out (the pictures that they showed were at least a month and a half worth of beard growth) and I was told if my beard didn't look like that in a week I would be fired. When I asked about the rule change I was told that I was allowed to have a beard but not grow a beard. So because I needed the job I shaved, they then went on to hire several men with beards, and even had one guy completely shave his beard and regrow it, so I decided to grow it out anyway since they said nothing about the other person. Again I was pulled aside and shown the pictures. When I pointed out that only one of the 6 people with facial hair was even close to the pictures he tried to make a few other people shave as well but of course they didn't because they were all hired under the assumption that their facial hair was appropriate.

0,"WIBTA if I were to dump my boyfriend for being a snobby movie critic? | My boyfriend hosts his own podcast dedicated to movies and he even has his own studio that he's renting out so that he can record there. He has some co-hosts, legit recording equipment, and he has a decent following. I always go to the studio to just sit on the side and watch as he records, but I've noticed that he's started to become a bit different ever since the start of the podcast.

On a podcast a few weeks ago, the topic was 2016 movies as my boyfriend and his co-hosts revisited some of their favorite and least favorite films of 2016. One co-host brought up Arrival as their favorite film of 2016 and while he was talking, my boyfriend loudly says ""YAWN!"" and he explains that he thought Arrival was boring. My boyfriend then goes into this giant rant about how he hated Arrival, calling it one of the most overrated movies of all time. He says that he looks down on people who like the movie because he claims that they ""think they're smart"" and he says that he's proud of himself for ""seeing past that movie"" and it's ""faux attempts at intelligence"". And whenever someone would try to change the subject, he'd just interrupt them and go right back to talking about how much he hates Arrival.

Then just a few days ago, he was recording another show and the topic was MCU movies. My boyfriend brought up that he thinks Age of Ultron is a ""hidden gem"" and ""massively overlooked masterpiece"". One of his co-hosts scoffed when he said those things and that set off my boyfriend. He starts attacking the co-host for his taste in movies and started saying stuff like ""Just because I have a better understanding of the art of film-making, it doesn't mean you have to be jealous of me."" That was actually enough for the co-host to just walk out in the middle of the show and my boyfriend said ""That's fine, I only want to talk to true auteur's of film on this show."" 

And just yesterday, I asked him if we could see Shazam together, but he simply responded with ""I deserve better than those DC movies."" I confronted him and told him that he needs to stop acting like he's smarter than everyone over his taste in film and he said ""Truth hurts, doesn't it?"" And it's like this a lot. Whenever I'm watching a movie he doesn't like, he'll just scoff and say ""Typical"".

0,"AITA for calling cops on a begging gypsy with a limp child in her arms? | Today I was out and about in a Greek city and saw this gypsy begging outside a supermarket. I usually don’t pay them any mind, but she had this maybe 2 year old child limp in her arms, it looked out cold. 

As a mom myself to a 15 month old, I got sick to my stomach imagining the stories of beggars who give their children drugs to sleep so they can illicit sympathy from passerbys. 

I called the police, which Greeks don’t typically do. I told them where she was and that she had a limp child in her arms and I was worried about his wellbeing. All they told me was thank you for bringing this to our attention and hung up. I assume they probably didn’t do anything about it, and I didn’t stick around to see. 

I got home and told my husband what happened and was met with abrupt hostility and anger concerning what I did. Apparently 1. It wasn’t my business and 2. I’m not supposed to get involved with crime concerning gypsies because they are “atimi” meaning, have no honor and can retaliate and 3. I made a fool of myself because the cops won’t do anything anyway and I’m the only idiot who would call the police.

I suppose this hostility comes from the fact that I’m an American and my husband is Greek and hes offended by my idealistic views, etc.

They immediately responded with that they don’t feel safe in the house since it has a gun. I just said “If you don’t feel safe, then leave”.

I (24F) have been vegan for almost 5 years, and was vegetarian before that. My family is generally supportive but when I was in high school and still living at home I often cooked my own meals, or just ate the sides because my parents weren't super in to cooking vegetarian. In the past year or so my mom has really opened up to it and has been experimenting with vegan cooking as well which has been nice to talk about.

I went home for the holidays earlier this year with my fiance, who is also vegan. My older brothers (26 and 28) still live at home with my parents. My fiance is also a professional chef (I'm an okay cook but usually follow his lead), and we offered to cook a nice dinner for the whole family.  My middle brother is a picky eater, but we made foods that are generally pretty well liked by the whole family. We made fresh homemade pasta and rolls, my fiance made a delicious sauce with lots of veggies, and a big salad. We served the food and everyone agreed that it looked and smelled delicious.

Then my brother goes to the fridge and gets a big block of cheese and starts grating it over his pasta. I asked him if he would please stop, we were trying to make a vegan meal everyone could enjoy, and purposefully hadn't put in any foods he didn't like. He said he doesn't like to eat pasta without cheese (???) I said that since we had put in a lot of effort into cooking and it was disrespectful when we had intentionally made the food to be vegan, in an attempt to show how good vegan cooking could be. He got huffy and said I was being too controlling. My parents remained neutral and didn't take either side. The mood of dinner was off to a bad start and remained uncomfortable.

At first when we all moved it I was happy to have siblings, but the feeling wasn't mutual at all and they excluded me a lot from things. Saying that I'm ""not one of them"" and other crap like that. Me and the 17yo fought A LOT like almost daily, nothing too bad just dumb kid ""brothers"" stuff. Our parents nipped that in the bud but arguments with him were daily till i was like 13 and just gave up. The 18yo HATES me, cause of me and her brother fighting a lot and same with the 15yo.

For 6 months never went over the minutes on the lines. Fast forward a few months my sister moves in and starts to take my mothers line from her and uses it. The next bill comes in and is $600 above the normal fees do to sisters use. I am unable to pay the bill and lose both lines. Some context: a few weeks after my sister goes crazy and commits crimes against both my mother and younger brother, police are called and she ends up arrested. 

Fast Forward to 2007: This is where the story takes place. A year prior I had gotten a cell plan witch included four lines of service, another feature was the plan had roll over minutes that built up for a year. Any unused minutes were saved and used in case I went over and I would pay no extra fees. My brother, mother and I each used a line and the other one just sat around with out use. One night my cousin comes over and I tell him how wonderful my plan is and how I have a crap ton of roll over minutes and even have a extra line sitting around. Cousin wants that extra line, so I think about and say you can have it for $30 a month till all the roll over minutes are used. Cousin takes the phone.

A week later I find out cousin gave the phone to my sister, as soon as I find I make contact with cousin. I tell cousin this isn't happening and he needs to get the phone from sister and return it. Cousin says I am being an a-hole and have no reason not to let sister use the line. I don't like bringing up peoples dirty laundry but had no choice at this point. I tell cousin back in 2003 sister took and used my mothers line of service I was paying for and caused $600 of overages and this isn't going to happen again.

Cousin then say, you are just doing this cause your mother and brother falsely accused sister of committing crimes against them. At this point I am furious and say, you have some nerve making lies up and for your information mother and brother both had evidence after the crimes were committed which police used to convict her. Cousin then says, your mother and brother fabricated the evidence before police arrived and sister told him this so it must be true. At this point I had enough and say, you are delusional cause my mother called me and asked for the police stations phone number and while on the phone with my mother I could hear sister committing these crimes.

She kept saying I should take it as a compliment and that a lot of people were doing these types of videos. I was annoyed because if the situations were reversed, I would just delete the video and apologize. I yelled at her that her trying to find “hot” photos of her own brother was some real weirdo behavior and that I would never even think of doing something like that because she’s my sister.

To clarify, I don’t really think she’s perverted but I do think it’s weird. I’ve had a couple of friends make inappropriate comments about her and I tell them to shut the fuck up. I don’t make fucking tik toks about it.

I will however get extremely annoyed if after I don’t answer for a couple hours/a day, someone will follow up with “???” “Are you alive???” “Hellooo??” This makes me irrationally angry and the more they text, the more annoyed I get and the more I refuse to respond, even if it’s someone I consider a good friend.

Anyway, this is not a problem too often, but it occurred recently again with a friend who I didn’t get back to in a day, and who since then has been sending me several messages/memes a day, trying to get me to respond. This is someone I consider a good friend and I know they are lonely right now, but my irrational annoyance is flaring up and I know if I respond it will be something snappy.

My question is, am I being an asshole here? I do strongly believe that no one is entitled to an immediate response for casual texts and the other is in the wrong for the nonstop texting. But I also feel guilty because I’m sure I am hurting my friend’s feelings. What do you think, AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for asking my girlfriend to look after my kids? | Hello people. My name is Matt (or let’s say it is anyway) and I am a 44-year-old dude with two kids, 8 and 14. Their mother, my ex wife, lives abroad at the moment and I have full time custody as we don’t want to ship ‘em half way across the world every other week.

I started dating a beautiful woman, let’s call her Jessica (32), two years ago now and we are getting on great. She moved in with me and the boys about a year ago and I feel like we are getting used to life together as a family. The boys like her and she is figuring out how to be a mother, which I love her madly for. I can only imagine how hard of a time I would have if I were in her shoes having to get used to a completely new way of life. 

About two months ago Jessica lost her job. She is living with me, I’m paying the bills and I fully support her. She doesn’t contribute with any money at this point and I’m okay with it - we’ve all been in tough spots and I love this woman. But then I asked her if she could look after the kids, pick them up after school and so on, and she completely freaks out. Calls me a complete asshole for using her as a babysitter and says that I am not taking the responsibility I should be taking as a father. 

I have struggled as a dad in the past, I wasn’t the most mature man when my kiddos were born and this leads to me taking her comment very close to heart. So I’d really appreciate some comments from a third person perspective. Am I the asshole for asking my unemployed girlfriend to look after the kids on occasion and pick ‘em up from school a couple of days a week?

1,"AITA if I smoke weed on the balcony after our neighbour complained? | My boyfriend and I like to smoke a joint every now and then. Usually we smoke on once a week on the weekend at night. We do this on the balcony of our apartment. The whole thing is over in 10 minutes after which we go back inside. 

A few days ago our neighbour stepped out on their balcony when I was reading a book out there. They said that they're very unhappy about our weed consumption and that we needed to stop. I told her I'm sorry and we'd make sure to go right to the other end of our balcony but we wouldn't stop. The way I see it is that we're out there for 10 minutes once a week max and it's usually after 10 or 11pm which I think is not too bad. She then called me a shit c*nt of a pot head with no respect for neighbours and went back inside. 

I told my boyfriend about it and we decided that we wouldn't stop but we'd move our table to the other side of the balcony.

0,"AITA for ignoring a guy trying to talk to me in the elevator? | I was in the elevator earlier today, trying to message my Uber driver. I was also listening to music. 

A group of guys walked in and naturally, I felt a tiny bit intimidated, but whatever. I continued doing my own thing. When I looked up, one of the guys was eyeing me and then said “hey, how’s it going?” Or something to that effect. 

I had a delayed reaction for some reason and didn’t process what happened so I just kind of ignored him and went back on my phone. From my peripheral vision, I saw him waving his hands at me. So I continued to stick to my guns and stared at my phone lol. 

I think one of his friends told him to stop bothering me and he was like “I’m just being polite!” And then went on a tangent about how he sees all sorts of people in the city. Then his friend said “you win some, you lose some”.

My floor came, so I got off. I feel a little asshole-ish, but at the same time, I don’t feel like I owed the guy a conversation just because he wanted to talk to me. There were other people in the elevator he could have tried talking to instead if he really felt like being chatty.

1,"AITA for making a “low effort” meal for my vegan cousin? | I had my family over for dinner a few nights ago and wanted to prepare something nice since I really love cooking. This is the first time we’ve all gotten together since Christmas, and my cousin let me me know in advance that she went vegan at the start of January as one of her New Year’s resolutions. It’s something she’s talked about doing for a while, but she didn't make the jump until recently. I told her I’d make sure there was food for her.

One of my best friends got me a nice set of ramekins as a Christmas gift, and I decided to test them out by making some smoked salmon souffles for dinner. I was a little nervous because I had never tried out this recipe before, but they turned out great. I also made a devil’s chocolate cake for dessert. 

For the side dish, I put together a salad with lettuce, arugula, mixed berries, and a strawberry balsamic vinaigrette. It was really tasty, and I thought it would be a good idea to make enough so that everyone could have it as a side and my cousin could have a large portion for her meal. I also made sure to keep the dressing separate from the salad because I knew it had honey in it. 

My cousin said she appreciated that I kept her in mind but that it seemed like her dinner was an “afterthought” and that salad wasn’t a meal on its own. She said if I had told her I was only making her a salad she would have brought a dish of her own to share.

This really rubbed me the wrong way because I feel like I did go out of my way to include her. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting to spend time with future MIL? | &#x200B;

First time poster here...

Last weekend my future MIL was staying with my fiancé and me to help iron, do chores, etc. She is very friendly and talkative whereas I am very introverted and like my space. When my fiancé is around I find her more tolerable because I have him as moral support and he also knows her better. MIL stayed for a longer weekend this time and while my fiancé was at work I decided to just stay out of the way in my room. MIL kept coming in and asking if I needed anything, if I wanted to go anywhere, to which I always responded, ""No, I'm fine."" As an introvert the constant bothering was driving me crazy. 

By the time my fiancé was home I was at my wits end and when we had dinner together I was being a little snarky. What sets her off is me giving my fiancé the last of my dinner and MIL telling me she won't let me because my fiancé is not my bin. I had had enough so I left and went to my room. She then starts yelling about how ungrateful I am, how I am making my fiancé fat, and how she knows lots of girls that he could date instead. All this two days after we had bought an expensive engagement ring together. 

She leaves and I start to cry while my fiancé tries to comfort me. She comes back and yells again, leaves again, and then comes back to yell again. I cry for a few more minutes and then leave the house to get away from her. When I come back my fiancé and MIL are talking loudly in a foreign language. My fiancé comes back a while later and explains she didn't mean it etc. and we go to bed.

The next morning I leave the house immediately and don't return until my fiancé picks me up after he is done with work. He thinks I was extremely rude and told me to apologise to his mom. I did apologise but I really can't look at her the same after she yelled at me like that. AITA for not wanting to send time with her and include her in planning my wedding?",False,False
1,"AITA For refusing to get my cousin into a top university because of a ""prank?"" | As all family stories this is winding, complex, and ultimately uninteresting so I'll try to keep it simple. 

A few years back, my cousin, then 14 years old, pulled a very nasty and dangerous ""prank"" on me. I got a call in the middle of the night during a blizzard from my grandparent's phone number with someone wheezing on the other end. I jumped out of bed, got in my car, and drove 25 minutes on icy roads to their house. I couldn't reach their number again from my cell but I was able to call an ambulance. 

When I arrived, I found two paramedics in my grandparent's foyer chatting with them as if nothing was wrong. Long story short, my cousin (grandparents' other grand child) had called me using their phone number (using skype or something) to play a joke on me. It was apparently lost on him that driving on icy roads in the middle of the night would be dangerous. My car suffered some damage that night, but ultimately I'm far more upset about the depravity that would lead my otherwise mild-mannered cousin to make me believe my grandparents were dying. 

Fast forward three years and now my cousin is a junior in high school. His mother (my aunt) has asked me to leverage my connections at a top university to get him a seat in their class that starts Fall 2021. For starters his SAT and ACT scores are middling, so that's already a disqualifier, but ffs why would I help him out after what he did to me? I told her on no uncertain terms: **no**. Afterwards I went as far to call my connection at the university to flag any application from my cousin.

Despite my family's insistence that he be punished and possibly committed to an institution for his ""prank"", his parents and even my grandparents have downplayed the entire thing as a ""boys would be boys"" prank. As far as I know he hasn't done anything like that since, but there were never any repercussions nor was there ever an apology.

My grandparents, aunt, and uncle have now disinvited me from family events including Thanksgiving and Christmas unless I help pull strings for my cousin. My parents have been great and have said they won't be participating either if I'm not invited. However, I'm still getting barraged with emails, texts, and calls from the rest of my family calling me names and demanding I do this for him and not let his future be ruined by a simple ""prank"".

1,"AITA for only complimenting one cousin’s appearance and not the other’s? | I (19F) have two cousins (9 & 7) who are half sisters. The 7 year old Tori is very pretty and looks like she’ll be my doppelganger when she grows up. The 9 year old Tiffany objectively isn’t pretty at all. Whenever I see them together, I’d compliment Tori by saying she’s so pretty and getting prettier every time I see her. I’d tell Tiffany that her hair looks nice, her shirt is cool, and the like. She never seemed to mind not getting the same compliment as Tori. 


On Sunday, I saw them again and complimented both of them in a similar fashion as I always do. This time, Tiffany asked me “so you don’t think I’m pretty too?” I told her everyone is pretty in their own way, that her long wavy hair is gorgeous and her fashion sense is very good. She didn’t seem to like my response and sulked the whole time I was there.


My mom pulled me in to another room and told me that it hurts Tiffany’s feelings when I keep complimenting Tori on her appearance and never Tiffany when she’s right there. She said we can give Tori as much praise as she deserves when Tiffany isn’t around, but when Tiffany is also there, it’s better to either compliment both on their appearance or just don’t bring it up to either of them.

My friend told me this a few weeks ago when it came up in a conversation, and I didn’t think anything of it at the time, assuming that all the relationships were super casual.

Yesterday, we were in her kitchen, while her brother and one of the girls were upstairs. I heard noise upstairs and asked who it was, to which my friend responded “his girlfriend”. I then said something along the lines of “so the other girls are out of the picture?” 

At this time, the girl happened to walk right into the kitchen, heard what I said, and turned right around to question my friend’s brother. She found out that the other girls were not out of the picture just yet, so she ended things with him and left. Apparently her brother really liked this girl and wanted an actual relationship with her. 

My friend is saying that I shouldn’t have mentioned the fact that he was seeing other girls in a place where she could have heard me, and that her brother was planning to start dating her exclusively but now I’ve broken them up.

1,"WIBTA if I don’t offer to pay on first dates? | I’m a woman in my early 30s. I have been out of the dating game for several years and I haven’t done much online dating. I want to start dating again and I would expect the man to pay for the first date; it’s a turn off if he doesn’t. Before people start jumping on me: 

1. I don’t push back if a guy wants me to pay my share on a first date. To me, it’s a signal of “we spent time together but I’m not interested in you romantically,” so I’m not upset. I would not be interested in seeing the guy after that. 
2. Yes, I pay for dates. Just not the first one. And when I pay for dates, I plan them, invite the guy, etc. I would expect a 50/50 split overall over time. 
3. I don’t require expensive dates. I always let the guy plan the first date so he can pick something that’s within his budget. 
4. If I’m not interested in the guy and know I won’t see him again, I would offer to pay my share on the first date and gladly follow through.
5. I’m going to preemptively say this because I know there’s bound to be a few comments. No I’m not a gold digger. I make over $200k as a single person. The men I go out with make around the same as me or less. 

My question is... would I be an ahole for not fake offering to pay on a first date? It would be fake not because I wouldn’t actually pay my share on a first date, but fake as in if the guy says yes, I’m no longer interested. 

I would much rather not even bother to offer unless I mean it, but I’ve read a lot of stuff on Reddit about how men hate it when women don’t even offer. But then I’ve also read that they hate fake offers.

0,"AITA for eating too much? | Hi!
My boyfriend(26M) and I(18F) had a bit of a fight earlier today because of how ""much"" I eat in a day. 
We are long distance and are about to go on a bit of a trip together for like 4 days, it's mostly to just relax together.
I paid for this entire trip, even his ticket to come. He hasn't put in a penny and I do not expect him to either.

The problem came around when I started talking about places I wanted to go eat, he basically shut me down and said that we would only have one meal a day and if I wanted more I could have apples or some other fruit.
He is underweight and very used to only eating once a day, while I really need my 3 meals a day.
I complained and said I didnt want that and that it would just make me grumpy to not have my food routines, we went a bit back and forth about it.
He said that a normal person doesn't need 3 meals a day and that I'm pushing my trivial needs to astronomical heights. He ended up calling me a spoiled bitch and thats when I broke.

I did get really upset and I told him to leave me alone and whatnot. He eventually did and we havent spoken since. 
I am very sensitive about food stuff, since I used to have an eating disorder and just recently I've actually started having a good relationship with food. It just felt like I got pushed down that hole again.

But yeah maybe I care about food too much? He said its just a few days and I shouldn't be so spoiled, and while that's maybe true I just wanted to spend my time with him in full comfort.

1,"WIBTA for suggesting what *I* think might help my friend with his depression? | My friend that I live with recently (a few months ago) told me that he had suffered with depression when he was in his teens, we're both 24, but was all good now. He's been a bit off for the past few weeks so I asked him if he's feeling OK yesterday and he said he's been feeling depressed for the past few weeks. He said there's no reason because life's going great, and he's going to see a doctor.

&#x200B;

I'm making this post because I care really deeply about him and have a tendency to not be very ""emotionally aware"" and don't want to annoy him or make things worse with what \*I\* think would help me in this situation.

&#x200B;

I've never suffered from depression apart from the normal and natural highs and lows of life (i.e. I don't know what he's going through). I like to look at things from a logical, ""objective"" (as possible) perspective and with things like mental health, etc that don't necessarily have a direct or logical cause, I know this sort of perspective can be unhelpful. Because of this, I've refrained from making any suggestions about how I think he could improve his life/depression. I've left things up to him, and let him know he can speak to me about anything whenever he needs to.

&#x200B;

But to be honest, I really am not surprised that he's feeling down. He doesn't live a healthy life:

Ever since I've known him, his diet has been atrocious, like 90% carbs and maybe a bit of fruit here or there. His typical breakfast is something covered in butter, no lunch, and then dinner is something very processed or take out.

He doesn't exercise. I've tried to get him to come to the gym with me but he doesn't want to. He works a 9-5 and comes home and sits on the sofa.

His sleep schedule isn't great. He'll get 4-6 hours of sleep a night and complain that he's feeling tired, etc.

&#x200B;

I've offered to join clubs with him, help him get some hobbies, etc, all this sort of stuff but he says that he wouldn't enjoy that (despite never trying). I don't know what the right level of ""pushy"" is here - I will ask, he will say no, and that will be that - I don't know if I should be doing more?

&#x200B;

Leading on, I know that all the above factors are things that someone who's depressed might do \*because they're depressed\*, but it's tough to know how to help in that sort of situation.

&#x200B;

He thinks that this is a chemical imbalance and that his lifestyle has little to do with it. I agree that it's likely this is the cause, but to me it would make sense to try to make improvements before using medication.

&#x200B;

So my question here is, would I be the asshole to suggest these factors in his lifestyle that are unhealthy and are probably contributing to his depression? At what point in suggesting improvements/trying to get him to eat healthily/sleep well/etc would I be TA?

And if it makes me an asshole to suggest these things, what can I do to help him at a time like this?",False,False
1,"WIBTA if burst a romantic bubble and tell the truth? | Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I had a friend named Jack. Five years ago, Jack met Jill. None of the women were really fond of Jill, but since Jack was single and Jill had finally stopped making plays for our boyfriends, we tried to make her feel welcome in the group. They married last November and Jack died in January after a short, unexpected illness. The entire time he was in the hospital, Jill refused to let anyone visit except for two of the groomsmen from the wedding, Ryan (best man) and Chad. Chad was one of the aforementioned boyfriends, but by this time he was single too. 

Jill pulled the plug, Jack dies and we all are devastated. Go through a weird as hell funeral where Jill seems more annoyed about having to do it than grieving for her husband. Later that night, she texts Ryan to see if he can come over to cuddle with her. He didn’t.

Two weeks later, Chad starts chemo. His brother Bob starts rounding up the care team only for Jill to swoop in and coordinate. Bob starts to suspect, he complains to our friend Belle (a nurse at the hospital where Jack died), and she tearfully shares she’d seen something at the hospital while Jack was in the coma. 

That was February. Now that it’s September, they’re “newly dating” and everyone is praising Jill for “finding love again with a friend.” She still milks the dead husband card for all it’s worth while basking in the acclaim showered upon her by those who have no idea what they’re applauding. 

Those of us who know the true timeline and are still mourning Jack’s death are pissed because it’s just plain disrespectful to Jack’s memory. We can accept that they’re dating, but feel like they’re deliberately hiding when it started to avoid the backlash.

0,"AITA for having 4 kids over when my child free cousin was visiting? | I have a 2 year old daughter, and I have 3 friends who I met at a group while I was pregnant, and they each have a 2 year old of their own.

We all have the kids in the same nursery which only allows a maximum of 35 hours per week that we can leave the kids there. This isn't standard where we live, it's an internal thing that they can legally decide, and it's due to staffing issues. They have us sign in with the exact times we pick up and drop off, so while we all work an average of 8 hours a day, with the commute we end up using about 9-10 hours of nursery time per day, and often run out of time before we can cover the full week.

Of the four of us, 2 of us have Friday off and 2 have Monday off. We agreed that on Mondays, the two who are free on that day would watch all 4 kids, and on Friday, the other two who are free then would take over, meaning the kids have nursery as normal Tuesday-Thursday. It's usually done out of someone's house but we will take the kids out sometimes.

My cousin, who is child free and openly admits to being ""freaked out"" by young kids, had to come to the town near mine for some business, and asked if we could meet up. We haven't seen each other in person for a few years now, not since I was pregnant, because when we have made plans to meet something has always gone wrong, like she got called into work or my daughter got sick. I responded that I'd like to meet but I'd be babysitting and she said that was fine, and it had been too long since we'd seen each other. I don't remember if I told her there would be 4 kids there, but I definitely said I'd be babysitting.

I told the other mum helping me on Friday what the situation was and she said it was totally fine if my cousin wanted to come by and she had no problem with it, and I knew they had some stuff in common and would get on so I told my cousin that it was fine for her to come by and gave her my address.

Friday rolls around, the mum I'm co-babysitting with comes over, the 2 other mums drop off their kids, and then a couple hours later my cousin comes over. She's not seen me in person since I was pregnant. First thing she says is ""holy fuck how many did you have?"" I laugh it off and introduce her to my daughter, then point to and name the other kids, and then introduce my friend/co-babysitter. Friend suggests we go into the kitchen, but my cousin says she can't stay and leaves within about 5 minutes of arriving.

A couple hours go by and then I get a text from my cousin who says that I should have told her how many kids there would be because I know kids freak her out, I made her uncomfortable, and she couldn't stay which she said was a shame as she wanted to see me. I said that I told her I was babysitting and my friend had said we could go into the kitchen if we wanted, but my cousin was having none of it and said I should have warned her.

I needed to have my home fumigated for termites, and the specialist recommended that we stay somewhere else for three days. I have an RV, so we had no problem with this. My kids (13 and 15 ) didn’t want to stay with us, so we let them go stay with my sister who just bought a small house in the city closest to us. 
 
My sister said that she needed some yard work done and asked if she and her husband could pay my kids to do it. They needed some ivy torn up and some seed planted. I thought that was fine, if they wanted to do it.

Well I pick them up, and they’ve got all the ivy torn up and seed thrown out. I asked them how much they got paid and they said a thousand dollars *each*. I told them no way, and took the money (checks that had to be deposited by me). I’m willing to give them a reasonable amount, if my sister will rewrite the checks and run it by me first.

She thinks I’m being unfair because they did “three days of work” and a lot of “research”, to get all of the ivy up and tell her what grasses grow naturally in the area. 

I think she’s setting an unfair precedent for my children, and spoiling them, an asshole move.

So I go on to eat dinner, and my parents come home around this time with 2 guests: my moms friend who we haven’t seen in 5 years and my grandma who just flew in yesterday.

My dog ate half a cup of dog food - she hadn’t eaten all day until we were finally home since she only likes eating when people are around. I realized a bit later she had finished the half so I go to put another half cup of dog food in her bowl.

Housekeeper: Don’t give her anymore food. She already ate. 

Me: I only gave her 1/2 a bowl more because she hasn’t eaten all day.

Housekeeper: Your dog is so fat. Stop feeding her so much.

At this point, I just exploded and yelled “DON’T TELL ME HOW TO RAISE MY DOG. SHE’S MY DOG NOT YOURS”

And everyone went silent and was shocked as I never really raise my voice at anyone. My mom said “Calm down, why are you so mad?”

I responded, “She (housekeeper) pushed me” and left the room.

We just found out it miscarried and I’m not too sad about the loss of the fetus. I am heartbroken that my wife is suffering. My heart hasn’t stopped pounding over her pain, idk if that’s anger or what but it’s there and it hurts. 

Here’s where the WIBTA comes in, my parents and family are pro-life and very staunchly so. I don’t want to have to deal with being there for my wife *as well as* dealing with the fallout of telling my parents idc about the loss of the fetus. They would likely call me a sociopath or sit me down with a slideshow of why a fetus is a baby. Or perhaps just not talk to me for some time. I’m just saying I’m very sad and channeling my pain from seeing my wife suffer to saying I’m sad over the loss of the fetus. However, I’m not a sociopath and this is really painful to deal with (the lying), but I just don’t want to put up with them. WIBTA?",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I (15f) cut my hair without parent's permission? | I recently discovered that my parents are really into gender roles after asking them if I would be allowed to get a short hair cut. My mum was pretty prompt about her answer and told me that she would never allow that because it would make me look like a boy and she didn't want people to think of me as too masculine. She then went on about me dressing too boyish and that she just wants a normal girl as a daughter. I was pretty hurt because I actually really like the way I dress and told her that I should be allowed to cut my hair since it's my body and therefore my choice. She said my hair belongs to her until I'm eighteen and that I should stop being ungrateful since she allows me so many things already anyway and that I'm not allowed to complain. 

In one of my last threads, many people have told me to just go with it and get my hair cut no matter what my parents say. I'm honestly not sure if that's a good idea because while I really, really hate my current hairstyle and would feel way more confident cutting it short, I'm honestly quite scared of my parents' reaction. Especially my mum's. Do you think it would be the right decision to get it cut professionally once the current situation ends? Because that's the thought I've been playing with lately.

0,"AITA for wanting a wedding even though I have a child? | My partner and I had our daughter earlier than we'd planned. We'd only been together for about a year, so we held off on getting married because we didn't want to get married just because we had a kid.

We live a modest lifestyle but our daughter never goes without and we have savings and such. We're saving up using a separate fund so we don't touch our emergency funds.

1,"AITA for how I spoke to the woman who we traded seats with on a long flight, so me and my wife could sit together? | So, me and my wife just flew across the US after a New Years' vacation. We tried to check in to our flight as early as possible, but missed our alarm while on a subway train, and 15 minutes after we were allowed to check in, there were no more seats on the airplane next to each other. There were only two seats in the same row, one window seat and one aisle seat.

I figured it would be fine, since almost everyone prefers an aisle seat to a middle seat, and nobody likes being talked past by strangers on a flight, so we should have no problem asking the person stuck between us to switch to the aisle so that we could sit together. We were also downright exhausted after the trip so we'd planned on one of us being able to sleep a little bit by leaning against the side of the plane.

We board the plane and get to our row, and there's a woman sitting in the middle seat already.

She looks pissed that she has to get up to let one of us past, and while she's preparing to get up, my wife says ""actually we were wondering if you'd be okay maybe taking the aisle seat instead of the middle so that we could sit together?""

She looks taken aback, pauses for a second, and then says ""I'll take the window seat.""

My wife says ""We were hoping for the window seat, is it okay if you take the aisle instead?""

She says ""No, I'd prefer the window seat.""

At this point the stress of dealing with all the travel probably got to me and I said, pretty curtly, ""well, would you rather sit between us for the whole flight instead?""

Equally curtly, she says ""sure, if that's what you want.""

I decided not to push it any further and said ""fine, take the window seat.""

(I know these sentences might not seem rude on their own but both me and the woman we were talking to were definitely talking in a stressed tone that indicated displeasure.)

She just sits in her middle seat looking at me for a few seconds and then says ""so are you making me get up or what?""

I said ""you can have the window seat, that's fine.""

So she shakes her head and scoffs and gets up and sits in the window seat, taking her sweet time about it.

She then shuts both of the blinds on the airplane windows in our row and makes like she's going to sleep. This plane has a dimmer for the windows, so she could've put it very dim but where we could still see out a little, but opted instead to set both windows to fully blacked out.

I know I have no right to expect someone to voluntarily exchange seats on our behalf when we don't have it reserved. But I also feel like most people sitting in a middle seat would rather take either the window or the aisle. She still did us a favor, but being able to switch to the aisle is also a perk so accepting that trade still a nice way to meet someone in the middle (no pun intended). I also feel like there might have been an element of vindictiveness in fully dimming both windows without asking us.

0,"AITA for refusing my friend's sunshine and rainbow outlook on the world after my dad suffered massive brain damage (cerebral haemorrhage) | I might have had framed it the wrong way so please hear me out.

I have a friend or had but I'd stay with having because I don't feel any resentment towards her since her intentions weren't of ill-nature. Sounds like Jane Austen novel, I'm sorry. Anyways - I have a friend. Her father died about 8 years ago while on holidays alone and we talked about it long before my father suffered brain damage. 

Anyways, back in late summer 2019, we were supposed to go on Golf holidays with my dad and the day before he drove off to do some practice, during which a vein in his brain ruptured and sprayed his right hemisphere with blood, damaging most of that half of the brain - that means not only he can't use his left side of the body but that he's now not well mentally either. There are ups and downs, it's an emotional rollercoaster and for past months I've been emotionally supportive of my mother too. I don't want to be too descriptive of the state he or my family is in but let's just say this continues to be hard and stressful for everyone.

Now. My friend (we work together) blanked me out, I felt like we're no longer friends and I began noticing she made friends with somebody else the exact ways she made friends with me before. So I got my courage up a bit and we talked openly; she told me I'm being extremely negative about the whole situation, that I should be looking for the good sides of the situation and so on. I never used my dad as an excuse, I still went to work every day, smiling, because I refused to have this ""have you heard"" over my head because ppl from work know my father well. I still made fun, still joked, I wasn't going around, visibly mourning, moping or any of that, except for a few moments of way-too-bad-to-show-nothing depression fits or those few times when I was expecting bad news. I worked hard, I tried my best, I woke up every day acting like all is just fine and nothing out of ordinary is happening while this new changed and horrible reality settled into my life.

I heard her out what she told me - she argues that ""at least I still have my father"" - which I judge as a lame excuse for the pain we all endured, are enduring and will endure. I tried to look for something good in it and suffered two absolutely fucked up weeks of feeling like I don't deserve to feel the pain I'm feeling. Basically, it felt like I was told I don't deserve to feel shit because it's not ""as bad"" like my depression, stress and anxiety were not justified.

So, I told her, that I thought about it and that I can't look for something positive in all this shit and that I hope she won't take it personally, because I totes respect her point of view and that I wish I was able to do this. She's not talking to me now. I told her this mindset of sunshine and rainbow makes me feel even worse and that I don't think false hopes and looking for positivity at all costs will help because facing truths is way more helpful, especially in the long run.

Given that she has no chance of getting back into her career, I've been encouraging her to try to find some entry level work like retail/shop work or something like that.

Last summer my son was born and ILs said they wanted to move near us (several states away) to be near him. In late Sept, ILs said they were ready to move, but since they didn't have jobs, wanted to live with us til they did.

I was hesitant (my house is small, had reno projects, settling into life with a baby, etc.), but agreed on the condition that they be out ""shortly after the holidays."" ILs agreed. We asked if they would be able to contribute financially, they said no. 

I won't go into all the details, but we had constant issues regarding boundaries, personal space, privacy, etc. We decided to let a lot slide since it was a temp situation. We put on a good front, and counted down the days until 2019.

 ILs did not tell us much about their job/apt searches.  Gave us one word answers when we asked. We offered to help with resumes, applications, apartments, etc., but they declined.

They made multiple comments about their bad financial situation, but they bought a new (2019) car and sold their house (for no profit, because they ""didn’t want to be bothered with the mortgage anymore""). They ate out constantly, at nice sit-down restaurants.

My FIL got a min-wage job. My MIL submitted job apps but was ""being picky"" (her term), and didn't send out any apps for 2+ wks because her computer was broken and she ""didn't think"" to go to the library or ask us if she could use ours.

So early Jan ILs tell us it's been harder for them to find jobs than they thought, they are in a rough spot financially and ask us if they can stay until ""March or the end of April at the latest."" We discussed boundaries. They agreed to make changes, and we agreed to let them stay til April. 

Things did not change. The stress was nearly unbearable but they moved out late April. 

I thought all's well, but on Monday MIL tells H, ""families should be able to count on each other and right now I can't say that I can count on you (meaning H)."" We knew they were struggling financially and were having a hard time finding jobs, yet we made them move out.

One fatal night I was working a late shift at my restaurant when I had received the worst phone call of my life, Alex had dove into a pond with some friends and hit his head on a rock upon jumping into the water and subsequently drowned. I spiraled into a deep depression without my best friend and am still working on myself to this day but his family dealt with it much worse eventually splitting up all together. Skip ahead 2 weeks to the day of Alex’s funeral.  His family said their piece and invited me and my mother to the podium to speak about Alex. I gave a 5 minute speech about everything we went through as best friends and how appreciative of the time I got with him I was. After I spoke they let anyone come up and say their piece as well so our coach spoke, some of our teammates spoke, and then I see a girl I knew from school but wasn’t very fond of come up and speak, enter April. 
April approaches the podium bawling her eyes out and then goes on to say they were in love and they were so close and how she’ll never get over this and even told fake stories of their intimacy and “crazy adventures” they had together. Knowing Alex spoke to her once over DM and on occasion in passing at school, I became enraged. Alex was my best friend we talked about everything I knew every girl he was intimate with and every little detail of his love life as he knew mine. Alex never liked her and even made a comment to me once about how fake she is for Instagram and how she over exaggerates everything for attention ( she would make videos of her crying anytime a tragedy would occur on the news and say she just wanted to die because the world was too tough). Anyway, after the ceremony she approached me and told me we all love him dearly and “I’ll miss him as much as you do... IF NOT MORE”. This sent me over the deep end and I went off on her in the parking lot saying she was despicable for trying to garner attention off of my best friends tragic death and we used to laugh at how pathetic she was.

1,"WIBTA for Asking My Sister to Stop Posting Progress Pics in a New Year's Resolution Facebook Group? | At the end of last year, my family decided that, in order to stay motivated and keep our Facebooks from becoming just about whatever our resolutions are, we made a Facebook group. Everyone is supposed to be welcome, which is part of why I'm hesitant to say anything. 


My sister is super thin. Like size double zero thin. She's also what my family affectionately calls a health nut. She does the whole plant-based, whole food, no oil thing, pretty much only drinks water, etc. etc. If you ever need advice on anything health or fitness related, she's a godsend, though. That's another issue. If I upset her, and she leaves the group altogether, then a lot of people will be pissed at me for ""running her off.""


The thing is that most of the people with fitness-related resolutions have decided to post weekly progress pics. And mostly that doesn't cause any issues. But then my sister is there, her waist maybe two feet around, and she's posting pictures each week. She's doing some sort of year-long push-up challenge; it's like 100 push-ups each day plus the day of the year. On 31 Dec., she's going to do 466. 


Anyway, the issue for me is that I don't think anyone that thin needs to be posting progress pics. She says it's to show her muscles growing in definition and all that, but all I see whenever I log into the group is an already skinny woman flaunting herself. And it makes me feel uncomfortable and unwilling to check the group's posts, even more than dealing with the constant posts about macros and calories and the really ""strong"" memes the fitness-resolutioners often post.

I’d say I’m friendly enough with everyone, but I’m not a ‘work bestie/husband/wife’ sort of person. This however doesn’t mean that I try and martyr myself if people want to do things outside of work, despite the subject of my post. As an example, I had a great time at our christmas party.

Someone in the office, who I’ll call ‘Sally’, is having a large birthday party at the end of the week. Sally’s been at the company for around 9ish months, and we’ve been perfectly affable with each other during that time. Before the christmas break a couple of people were talking about how they’d been invited to Sally’s party group on Facebook - it was absolutely no skin off my nose that I hadn’t been invited.

The next day at work Sally came over to chat, and said that she was sorry about not inviting me straight away, but she didn’t know that I had Facebook (even though we were friends on it, and had been for months?). I said that it was fine, and I was looking forward to going. A few hours later during lunch, one of the people who had been going to the party from the beginning asked to speak in private. She said that she’d noticed that I was now going to Sally’s party, and said that I should know that, in a group chat that she was in with Sally and a couple of the other party-goers, Sally had mentioned that she was going to be ‘forced’ into inviting people to the party in order to cover the costs for the venue hire (I assume she meant through gifts of money, or the value of gifts?). Someone had asked who, and she specifically mentioned me by name, saying that she ‘wouldn’t do it unless she was absolutely desperate’. This person showed me the chat, so I know that it actually happened.

I immediately removed myself as ‘going’ from the group.

Let me tell you a bit about myself. I find kids gross. Maybe I'll change once I have my own. I'm also a bit of a germaphobe. I wash my hands up to 10 times a day or every 5-10 minutes when cooking. After handshakes I immediately want to wash my hands. Whether sharing my computer, car, gaming controller, I think, “is this the type of person that washes their hands after using the bathroom?” Do they sneeze into their hand instead of their shoulder? When I pet pets I immediately wash my hands. Those Clorox wipes that kill 99.99% of germs are some of my favorite products. My family also knows how I am about germs, and they often make small jokes about it. After I cook a meal or something for everyone, my dad asks questions like, ""Did you wash your hands?"" 

Anyway, I’m watching the kids and it’s supposed to be 3 hours at most. Well, it's 11 and my mom isn't home yet. 12. Now 1.. and one of the kid's pants are wet. He's rolling around on the rug, sitting on the couch, and the thought of that is just excruciating. His wet pants are touching everything. I called my mom and said the kid needs a diaper change and that I wouldn't do it. Truth is, I don't think I \*can\*. She basically told me that I have to or the kid will get a rash. I was getting pretty angry, and the fact that my mom is the type of person that is always late everywhere just made me more mad. She was angry too and I hung up. 

A little while after that my dad called and told me to change the kid's diaper and I repeated my story. He got home at around 2:30 and pretty much yelled at me to change the diapers. I didn't do it. I left. My mom eventually came and changed the diapers. Both were really angry were pretty much telling me to get a job and move out. It wasn't a good situation to be in at all. Obviously I don't want a little kid to get a rash, but I just can't change the diaper of some kid I barely know, I'm sorry.",False,False
0,"AITA for feeding my daughter McDonald’s despite her mom giving me express ‘instructions’ not to? | I had a ONS 11 years ago, my daughter is the result of that. She is my only child and she is my absolute life. I never wanted kids and when my daughters mom was pregnant and I heavily thought about just paying CS and dipping but my own dad passed away days before she gave birth and it changed my perspective completely. 

My daughter is a tall kid, I’m 6’4 and her mom is around 6’. She’s a little chubby but I would personally call it puppy fat. Just soft little tummy rolls, she’s perfect and healthy and there’s 0 need in my opinion for her to be ‘dieting’ or anything stupid like that. She’s also very physically active, loves soccer, and is always out playing with her friends. 

Her mom keeps texting me over the last year that our daughter is fat and needs to lose weight. When she stays with me (which is 2-3 nights a week) we eat homemade dishes, usually baked fish and greens or rotisserie chicken sandwiches. Nothing super bad for you. However I take her every weekend (and have been taking her ever since she was little) to McDonald’s once a week where she gets a small fry and ice cream. 

My own dad did that for me as a kid and I remember it was the best thing all week for me. I loved it. Especially because dad has passed I want to honor that tradition with my kid. 

My daughters mom keeps telling me that I need to stop because it’s unhealthy, and that how can I expect our daughter to lose weight if she’s eating McDonald’s. I told her I don’t think our daughter needs to lose weight, and I said that what she eats at her place is all crap, I said have you actually cooked for our daughter or are you just feeding her microwave meals? She replied cussing me out and I’ve not heard from her about it since, but my own mom thinks I should respect my daughters mom and quit with the McDonald’s. In my view, it’s a daddy daughter tradition and I don’t think a small fry and ice cream is gonna hurt her.",False,False

1,"AITA for how I dealt with a dog eating my SO favourite pair of shoes? | My mother’s dog ate my SO favourite pair of shoes - nice leather flats with big ribbons, good quality the whole lot worth at least $150. I’m strongly in the camp that, whilst it sucks that the dog ate your shoes, you left them in the ground, dogs sometimes eat things and life goes on. 

As soon as it happened, I check online and they are all sold out in her size.  No issues,  I ring the nearest store. They can order them in from the other side of the country. Awesome, I say please wait I’ll ring my SO and let her know about the situation and see if she wants the same pair or we can get another. 

Now, I must preface this by saying my SO is volatile at the best of times due some mental health issues. I support her with it all, so part of me was like “I’ll ring her, let her know, that way she’ll calm down before coming home if she invariably gets angry”. Anyway, I ring, she’s predictably furious. I tell her that I’ll order another pair. She’s screaming,  telling me not to order another pair because she should be able to leave things wherever and not have the dog eat them, doesn’t want to spend her money on shoes she’s already bought (these are all fair points by the way). Anyway I tell her I’ve already ordered them and not to worry, I will use the money from my “spending” budget to pay for it so you won’t have to use her spending budget and then end the phone call. 

Anyway, I ring back and start to order these shoes. My phones blowing up with my SO ringing (7 missed calls). Im getting multiple messages saying to cancel the order from my SO in a rage. I’m told I need to order a gift card online to do a phone order as the store won’t take a credit card over the phone. No issues. Still getting multiple messages from SO that she’ll go into the store and cancel it herself. 15 minutes pass I ring back and start the process again, only to be told that my fiancée has walked into the store. The sales representative says “it’ll be easier if I deal with your SO I store” I say thanks for your time and hang up. 

SO comes home forty minutes later, still in a rage about the whole situation. However, not only is she upset about the shoes, she’s upset that I lied about having ordered the shoes when I hadn’t (yet).

0,"AITA for not supporting my GF's raw vegan diet? | I've been with my gf for three years. When we got together she was vegan and ate a pretty normal vegan diet. I'm a ""flexitarian"" in that I'll eat vegan food at home but I have whatever I want when I go out. It just makes life easier living with my gf if there's no animal products at home.

The issue is that in the last six months, she has gotten more and more obsessed with her diet. She's become a 'raw vegan' after watching a bunch of youtube channels that claim only eating raw fruits and vegetables is the most natural way for people to eat.

I'm not down with this way of eating at all. I want to eat some real food. She is spending a shitton of money on organic fruits and veggies. We've always split the grocery bill and it's seriously tripled in the last few months. I can't afford to spend this much money on food and I'm really fucking tired of eating what is essentially the same thing over and over again. Salads, cut up fruit, smoothie bowls, ""noodles"" that are just spiralized veggies, etc. Everything is cold. I constantly want to go out after dinner and get something substantial. 

I started buying my own groceries and told her she can do whatever she wants, but I'm not going to keep eating raw vegan food. It was fine for a little while but I lost like five pounds and I'm just not into it. I want some fucking pasta. 

My GF feels like I've abandoned her and I'm not supporting her ""health journey"". She wasn't so obsessed with food before and diet has never been an issue prior to this. She's lost a lot of weight, I would guess probably 10 pounds on an already slim frame. I don't like it and I want her to gain the weight back.

She's saying if I don't support her in this, it's like I'm encouraging her to be unhealthy. She can't afford a raw diet on her own and feels like I should keep contributing to the raw grocery bill even if I buy my own food.

0,"AITA for calling the cops on a homeless guy for living on the street near my house? | There's a guy who lives out of his RV in my neighborhood.  He parked his RV next to the community park, along with 2 of his other vehicles as well.  So 3 vehicles in total.  Local bylaws limit parking on streets next to public parks to 3 hours maximum.  This guy and his 3 vehicles have been parked there for over a year.  Living in an RV on city streets is also illegal.

I called the police (non-emergency line) to report this, but got directed to parking enforcement, and they then directed me to the parks board, and they directed me back to parking enforcement.  In the end, it is now with the parks board and they send a park ranger to handle it on a priority basis.  Typical government bureaucratic red tape.  I have a feeling nothing's going to be done about it.

I posted a rant in my city's subreddit (with throwaway account) about how I was disappointed in the city's inaction to this issue.  I was met with lots of hate about being mean to a homeless guy.  How I should leave him be, or if he's not hurting anyone then what's the harm, or how is he bothering me, I should help him instead, etc etc.

The guy has been parking 3 vehicles illegally for over a year.  He takes up parking spaces long term that are meant for park visitors to use.  He lives out of his RV which is illegal.  He uses the street as his personal ashtray.  He throws food scraps into the park (I think to feed wild animals).  He releases his RV's waste water into the streets.  All of this is just so illegal.

Plus, he has 3 fully insured vehicles, so he's not a penniless homeless guy.  And he has an RV, he can live anywhere in that.  There are RV parks that he can go to, or other places that allow parking long term.

So AITA for wanting this guy gone?",False,False

I am a mother of 3 kids. I have a 16 yo son and two daughters, 14yo and 13yo
. 
When they come back from school, I take their phones and put them in my bedroom so they have no access to them. They only get to use their devices on the weekend, that includes their play station or my laptop. My son complains saying that all his friends dont have their phones or other stuff confiscated as soon as they get home. He also complains that he cant have his phone in his room overnight.

0,"AITA for kicking my daughter out? | Search up my post history, I don't care. I'm at the end of my rope, she's at the end of her's and I can't do this anymore.

A week ago, my daughter (who lives with me - she is turning 30 soon) and I got into an argument regarding custody over her 3 year old son. We'll call my daughter Annie and her son Tommy. I have custody of Tommy because, at the time of his birth, Annie was on drugs. She's been sober and living with me for 2 years now. At this point, I still do not trust Annie with caring for Tommy full time/by herself considering she doesn't have enough patience/responsibility to care for a 3 year old, especially one that has a severe illness (cystic fibrosis). She still barely understands his illness (Annie asked me the other day why can't they just give him new lungs so that she doesn't have to do all of the work that goes into his care when she gets custody) and has refused to take over or even learn how to deal with all the insurance and hospital jazz.

Going back to the fight, Annie was pissed off because she thought she wanted the keys to my car. She said she had to go somewhere, but didn't specify where. I (nicely) asked here where and if she needed gas money and she just flipped out of nowhere. She threw one of Tommy's toys at the TV, cracked it, and then went on a rant about how I don't trust her and that she's a grown woman who can do whatever she wants. Mind you, almost a year ago, she crashed my car and blamed me for allowing her to use it. She also brought up how she doesn't get to be a mother to her son and blames me for them not having a good relationship.

I admit, I've got my own quirks that make me hard to deal with. I recognize that I have been a too overbearing and that I need to let her heal at her own pace, but I feel that I need to draw the line somewhere. I also said something I really regret: ""Maybe you should think about caring for your kid like I have to prove to me that you're an adult."" That's when she got pissed and almost attacked me before she walked out.

She was gone for 12 hours, despite knowing of a doctor's visit for Tommy I wanted her to be there for and knowing that she had to show up for work after the appointment. She comes back drunk as hell and smelling of weed. My one stipulation for her other than having a job is no drug use, legal or illegal - my daughter is very much a go big or go home type, and even though I recognize not all drug use is bad, I need her to focus on Tommy.

1,"AITA- for not letting my son take off work so he can move into his home? | So, just some clarification, my son works for me; our job is an outdoors type of job, and it depends on the weather. Our weather patterns this year have been rainy, and wet overall, but we’re now on a dry spell meaning work can resume.

So, here’s the scoop concerning him trying to move in, whenever we had downtime, I would always offer to help. The problem is, my son wouldn’t be so enthusiastic about moving (you’d think they would yell “see ya!” After the house loan was official), he would just brush off my offers to help. 

Whenever I ask him if he’s going to at least sleep at the new house, he just responds with “i don’t know”, “maybe”, or he shrugs off the question. 

Like I said before, he didn’t take advantage of the downtime due to the weather, and now it’s too late for that. Work will resume, and be just as busy, I’m short handed, so I can’t afford workers cutting off.  

Recently, my son asked if he could take time off to supervise the HVAC repair technicians, and I told him he can’t, and I explained to him that we’re going to be busy. Yes, he’s worried that the cold will freeze the pipes, but it’s going to be 60 degrees for the foreseeable future. 

Additionally, he wants to move furniture like a couch, bed, and tv stand into the new house. I told him we have work, and he then started acting like he was holding a grudge against me. He claimed that moving would take less than an hour. I politely remind him that we would be way too busy with work to be doing that. 

He then claims that we “won’t get around to it, until work slows down, which is months away.” 

I remind him that part of his situation was self inflicted by not capitalizing on the downtime. I then lay out his three options for getting moved in: 

1) wait until the weather is crappy again, and we will move furniture in then. However, I have my doubts that he’s going to be enthusiastic about moving in then, if he wasn’t enthusiastic the last time we had bad weather. 

2) move in on your own time. The problem is, that it’s dark when he’ll be getting around to moving in on his own time, unlikely he’ll find willing friends to help unless he gives an advanced notice. 

3) if he’s worried about “months”, then he could just rent out the property and at least make some sort of additional income, his house is in a neighborhood that has a tight housing market, everyone wants to live there. 

A fourth option I never mentioned was that he could just take a camping air mattress and sleeping backs up that way, but an air mattress is pretty annoying to sleep on.",False,False

1,"AITA for cutting ties with a close friend that can’t make it to my wedding because of his mom? | To give a bit of background, I am turning the dreaded 30 next year which is offset by marrying the woman of my dreams in the summer. It’s going to be the biggest, happiest and arguably most important day of my life. My soon wife-to-be is a foreigner and for the sake of her family (since getting a visa to come to the US is super hard and expensive from where she is from), we have decided to make it a destination wedding and get married where she is from. Growing up, there is a friend of mine, call him X, who is the son of one of my mom’s friend. He was definitely my best friend growing up. When I graduated, which was 7-8 years ago, that’s when we started hanging out less due to work and just life in general. So what I tend to do nowadays is host a guy’s day where a handful of the guys closest to me are invited to my home to play video and board games, drink beer, talk, catch up and generally hangout. So I send out the wedding invites, I was never in a gang before but I’d imagine this would be the closest I’d ever get to giving an “OG call”. All of my groomsmen respond yes except for X...even the ones that live out of state, then I get the phone call. He hits me with, I don’t know how to tell you this, but I can’t make it to your wedding. It catches me totally off guard. I stumble for words and ask is this because of the cost? Because if it is, I tell him not to worry about it, I can cover for him, flight, hotel, you name it. Then he tells me, no, the reason he can’t come is because his mom and girlfriend don’t want him to. I try to understand why they say that and X says that he is very sorry but because the wedding is abroad, his mom thinks the destination itself is dangerous, even though we are at a five star (think Four Seasons) resort. He continues to say he’s sorry and the reason why he hasn’t told me sooner is because he was conflicted and his mom and girlfriend have been telling him to make this call to me for weeks so he can “get over with it”. Then he tells me that if only the wedding was held locally, basically where we live now, he would make it in a heartbeat. Now, for a bit of background, X’s mom has been going through a tough time, health wise, so I’m not one to make things worse by causing tension between X and his mom, so when he says because mom, it sounds like an excuse that I can say anything against. I thank him for letting me know early and don’t feel like making excuses for him to come and hang up. I spend the next hour after that just processing what I just heard and trying to force back tears. My mouth becomes dry, it’s definitely one of the most disappointing news I’ve ever received. For the next few days after that, I’m trying to rethink my friendship with X. If it was the other way around and X was getting married in Kalamazoo, I’d become Dora the effin explorer to get there. It just hurts so much. So here it is, am I the asshole for cutting ties with one of my closest friends because he is not making it to my wedding?",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my sister she can’t wear a wig if she wants to be a bridesmaid at my wedding? | Yes more wedding/hair drama...

I’m getting married this May. It’s coming up quickly actually. My sisters are both bridesmaids and everything has been decided regarding dresses, etc. 

Last week my younger sister got a cute pixie cut. I told her it looks good on her and thought that was it. This week she sent me a picture of her in a really bad wig. This is like the kind of wig someone would wear on Halloween. It’s long, curly, and a very light, lavender-grey color. The wig is just not natural at all, the hairline doesn’t match up with her own and it looks like it’s constantly sliding forward. It’s also got that very dense/plastic-y look that’s not at all similar to real hair.

At first I thought she’s going to some cosplay event but she says she bought it for my wedding. She says she got a pixie cut just so she’ll be able to easily wear fancy special event wigs in the future, and she got this one because her favorite makeup Youtuber recommended it or something. 

I basically told her no, no bad wigs on bridesmaids, and all hell came loose. She said I’ve got no power over her hair choices even if it’s my wedding. I just told her the wig looks far too jarringly fake and if she got something more realistic then I’d be ok with it. 

She’s basically been spamming me the past few days about how unreasonable I’m being and what a bridezilla I am. She also brought up our aunt who wears wigs asking if I’m gonna ban her too. I told her this aunt is actually bald and her wig is very natural so it’s ridiculous to make this comparison. 

I don’t know if I’m handling this the right way. It’s her hair but it’s also my wedding and ultimately she’s in my party. I wouldn’t be ok with anyone wearing costume-ish clothes or otherwise, and I feel like this wig definitely falls into that category. AITA?",False,False

WIBTA if I went ahead and got my desired breed of dog against their will?

TL;DR Landlord doesn't want me to get my desired breed of emotional support dog because they don't want the 100 year old house I'm living in to get damaged. WIBTA if I went ahead and did it anyway?",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting to include the foster kid in a family photo? | This will be on a throwaway. I’m hoping Reddit can help me solve a dilemma between my siblings and I. 
I am the second oldest of 5 siblings. We are 21 M 19F (me) 16F, 13M 9F. 

Every year since my youngest sister was born we have been doing funny photo shoots for my mom’s birthday. We put the photos into a giant card and all go out shopping for her birthday present. This has become a tradition that has gotten better and better over the years. My Mom always loves it and collects the cards. 
Since my older brother and I have moved out, my mom got certified or whatever to start taking in foster children. They have one (14 or 15ish? F) that’s been staying at the house for like four months. 

Here’s the dilemma:
I don’t want her in the pictures. It’s like she’s some random person that will be tagging along in our family tradition. She seems ok as a person, I haven’t really spent much time with her. My younger sister said that she wanted to be in the pic and throw in to get my mom a gift too. I think that this should be a siblings only thing. My older brother agrees with me, that it would be weird to include her. Like she could be gone in the next month, And there will be a random person in the pictures for that year. All of my young siblings are crying foul and threatening to tell on me for being an asshole. 
From the outside looking in am I (and my brother I guess) being an A-hole? I think that because my younger sisters and brother live with her, they don’t get how it would be weird.",False,False
0,"AITA for not giving a ""friend"" a chance to explain why she ghosted me for 7 months? | A little backstory.  We had been friends for about a year prior to this and I thought we had gotten pretty close.  We'll call her K for this.  We had met online through a game and while we never met in person(we live on opposite sides of the country), we had several video chats and spoke for hours each day.  

She had told me that her and her long-term boyfriend had broken up because he was unwilling to commit to her with an engagement.  I always made sure K was ok and knew she did the right thing for herself.  I never once hit on her or flirted with her because I didn't want her to think I was trying to swoop in on her.  She never flirted with me either.  I'm only mentioning this so people don't think I was trying to be the ""nice guy"" stepping in.  

We were getting along fine, laughing and having fun.  She told me she felt much better and was glad I was there for her when she was down.  The summer came and my birthday is always a rough spot for me as I really don't have any friends where I live.  I have people who say they are but then don't include me in anything.  K knew this and had been very sympathetic.  I showed her the texts I sent to the people near me I invited to a party that had gone ignored.  No one replied.  I got no response from her.  I don't check all of my social media all the time and figured she was just busy with work.  I texted her weekly asking if she was ok to no response.  My calls over Skype were ignored even when she was online.  

After about a month of texting and getting no responses, I go to Instagram(she doesn't have FB) to see if she's been posting.  I find out she's getting married to her ex.  I text her again congratulating her.  I never bring up any of my doubts from what she's told me.  Again, no response.  I move on after realizing she had no interest in being friends with me.    
I got a text last week from her saying she's sorry and that she didn't mean to disappear on me but she had some ""stuff"" going on.  I responded back that I knew she had ""stuff"" going on and that I was happy she was happy but if I wasn't worth telling she was getting married directly that we weren't friends and to not contact me any further.  She asks if she will be at least given a chance to explain everything.  I just sent back ""No.""  I was called every name in the book and told how I was an asshole for not being understanding.  

So AITA?  I don't think I did anything wrong here.  I don't want an explanation.  I just expected to not be ghosted for 7 months and then still only be told she had ""stuff"" come up.",False,False

0,"AITA for telling my girlfriend to shut the fuck up after she insulted my sisters thighs? | I’m 30 and my 12 year old sister is living with me right now because mom and pops are vulnerable so it made more sense for me to care for my sis for the time being. 

She is a really great kid and tbh I feel in a lot of ways like she’s my own kid because my mom and dad don’t speak English so I kind of had to raise my sis in ways that they couldn’t. Hard to explain but I’m sure anyone with a secondary culture will get what I mean- my mom and dad are great parents but having an English speaking person to guide you through shit when you live in an English speaking country is invaluable imo and my sister trusts me with stuff she won’t necessarily trust my parents with. 

Anyway my girlfriend was FaceTiming me and my sister walked past in shorts and a t shirt cuz it’s hot. My ~~sister~~ gf waited til my sister had left the area ( but not the room) and made a face and said ‘maybe feed her less OP, her thighs are kinda chunky’ 

I saw red and told her to shut the fuck up (just came out my mouth) and immediately ended the call. My sister is a bit chubby but ffs who says stuff like that about a 12 year old girl. 

Literally. Everybody. I. Know. Has been texting me that I’m a POS boyfriend and that how can I disrespect my gf like that. I am expecting an apology from HER but to my shock everybody is expecting ME to apologize.

1,"AITA for telling my therapist my friend neglects her kids? | I didn’t give a last name, so she can’t make a report. I’m just really upset by what I’ve seen. My friend always says she’s cleaning, but whenever I go over their place is gross (I mean food on the walls and dog shit on the carpet gross). Last time I went over there, I had to move because I was siting next to a container of moldy oranges and it smelled so bad.

But my main issue is with her kids. She has a 7 and a 3 year old. She’s very much a “tv is the babysitter” type of parent. Whenever they fuss, she just gives them a juice box or those Cheeto balls that come in the barrel. She doesn’t change their diapers often enough. I go over and both their diapers (yes the 7 year old still isn’t potty trained) are saggy and loaded, and she doesn’t change them for hours, even if it’s obvious they’re crying because they’re soiled. She doesn’t comb their hair, so their bangs just hang in their face and they have trouble seeing. She yells at them and tells them to go away and stop bothering her when she’s busy with someone. She’ll use drugs around them and not care, even after they were both born premature and both show cognitive issues due to her doing drugs during both pregnancies.

This has all really been bothering me lately, especially because I’m technically a mandatory reporter since I work in health care (we work in an old folks home). I decided to tell my therapist and asked her what to do. She wanted me to give their last name but I’m not ready to get CPS involved (I’ve seen them do good, but I’ve seen them make things much worse so I’m hesitant). Now my therapist is upset with me because I won’t give their last name and I regret saying anything.

AITA? I feel like if I wasn’t ready to do something about it, I’m not ready to tell anyone about it. I shouldn’t have said anything I feel like but it’s weighing on me so much I’ve felt sick to my stomach just thinking about seeing her at work today. ",False,False
1,"AITA for making my daughter wear her school uniform after school? | This school semester I have implemented a new rule for my thirteen year old daughter to stay in her school uniform after school. This was due to a couple of problems we had the first semester of school. She would come home and change, and spend maybe an hour changing in and out of different outfits before settling on one, leaving clothes out and unfolded. Then, she would start her homework later than I would have liked, and many times skipped assignments, which I did not realize until we got her final report. Also, she would basically have double the normal amount of laundry due to her changing after school, which she always dragged her feet in doing. 

This semester, I told my daughter that she is not allowed to change out of her uniform after school. I expect her to do her homework right when she gets home, still in uniform. She also eats dinner in her uniform and completes her chores. She doesn’t change out of her uniform until after she showers and changes into her sleepwear. This has definitely cut down on laundry, her room is cleaner, and she’s actually been getting all her homework done. 

However, my daughter hates this new rule and will constantly ask when she can change. She has gone ahead to change without permission, and while I could have just let it go, I made a point of making her change back into her uniform to instill the rule. Then, she wanted to go out with some friends after school yesterday, and I said she could, and she wanted to change, but I wouldn’t let her as it was a school day and she was already wearing the uniform. One of her friends was also wearing the uniform because she did not have time to go home and change, but the other two girls were not wearing the uniform, and my daughter said she was humiliated wearing hers.

0,"AITA for only allowing small parties at my new tiny restaurant? | Hello reddit, I’m making my first throwaway account (and my first account in general) to get business advice from this sub (very sound, I know)

SO, my wife and I just opened our first restaurant (yay!), a very specific type of African food in a pretty small city, which means 2 things: first, we are the only restaurant of this cuisine in the city and second, we are EXTREMELY busy. I know this is just a new restaurant phenomenon and the shine will wear off, but we’re always going to at least FEEL busy due to the fact that our location is soooooo tiny. 
If all goes well, we’re thinking about a second location or a relocation, but for now we have a tiny hole in the wall with 8 two tops (each has a booth and chair side, meaning sometimes more people can squeeze on the booth side) and a tiny counter for technically 5, but realistically 3 people. 

So far, this hasn’t been too much of an issue, we can move tables around and avoid overbooking by not booking at all (we don’t accept reservations) but since it’s holiday season and families are in town, we’ve been noticing a lot of bigger parties. Last night we had to seat a party of 15, and while to be fair 4 were small kids, as you may recall, we only have 8 tables technically designed for 2! It took up literally half the restaurant, so the wife and I were discussing limiting the size of parties we permit. Without fail, every large party we’ve had has apologized for bringing so many people not having realized the size of the location, and a fair amount have left entirely after hearing the wait they’d have to face... 

I believe limiting the size of parties we allow to 6, maybe 8, we can avoid these issues. Unfortunately for now, we aren’t built for big banquets or family reunions. my wife believes we shouldn’t turn anyone away as we aren’t sure how long this initial boom will last, and we aren’t sure how this will reflect on us long term. I don’t wanna feel like I’m punishing families, but I feel our space truly is extremely limited. AITA?",False,False

I was extra annoyed cause this same situation just happened to me when I watched Star Wars where the woman next to me was using her phone every 5 minutes. This time I noticed the girl next to me was playing Bejeweled. I would be more understanding if it was a text because maybe she is waiting on important news.

1,"AITA for scheduling my wedding the weekend before my sister’s? | I’m American and just got engaged to my Aussie fiancé a little over a month ago. We’ve started planning our wedding and have run into a big problem: 

My fiancé’s parents, brother and sister-in-law, and nieces and nephew have been planning a family trip to the US for a long time, and they’ve already booked their flights to California next August. Their plan is to stay with us for a little over a week and then spend another week and a half on a road trip across the Southwest (Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, etc.) before flying out of Dallas.

My sister Jess is also getting married in August, and my fiancé’s family already knows we won’t be available that weekend and have timed their road trip to start a few days before the wedding. However, they will be in our city the weekend before that.

I asked my fiancé if there’s any way his family would be able to fly to the US twice in one year, and he said no. because round-trip flights from Australia are really expensive. We would have to push the wedding back another year minimum for them to be able to make it out here again, which we don’t want to do. My fiancé says he’s okay with his extended family not being able to make it, but it’s really important to him for his parents and brother to be there. After a lot of conversation, we decided to go ahead and set our date for the weekend his family will be in town. I sent an email to my parents, grandparents and Jess last night, explaining our decision. 

Well, Jess left me a really upset voicemail this morning, saying our aunts/uncles/cousins aren’t going to be able to afford to travel across the country for two weddings a week apart. She thinks they’ll just go to mine because it’s first and skip hers. 

I feel really bad about the timing, but we didn’t choose the date with any malicious intent. We just want my fiancé’s immediate family to be able to come. AITA?",False,False

Unfortunately, she left it at the office at the end of Monday and forgot about it until the next day. But by the time Tuesday came, it was already gone.

1,"WIBTA if I move states to force my daughter to end affiliation with a certain group? | I just turned 45 recently. My only daughter is 16. Her mother died horribly two years ago. Because it was drawn out, she was able to write her ""last words."" It was a list of grievances about me. My daughter read the letter.

Following my wife's death, my daughter has gone ""off the deep end,"" so to speak. She immediately posted the letter to social media. Soon after, she asked me to end the cello lessons she had been participating in since childhood, dyed her hair a distasteful shade of red, and started hanging out with this new group of people. Her grades have been plummeting as well.

I can only describe them as hedonists. They are mixed in age and ethnicity. I know they take drugs and vandalize. Our family assistant told me she has asked him for money on two occasions. She wouldn't specify what it was for.

I've tried absolutely everything. I took her to the most highly recommended therapist I could find. I never slandered her, even after she posted the letter. When I asked her why she was behaving this way, she told me I had always been cold to her and her mother and that I had never loved them. She cited the year-long affair I had while my wife was pregnant as evidence. She also told me we only had a family assistant because I was too lazy to be a true father.

1,"AITA for wanting two hours of daily time away from my baby? | I have cerebral palsy which gives me incredibly poor balance and I generally cannot walk without holding on to something and I use a rollator outside the house. Because of this, I knew before getting pregnant that I would need extra help, as I will not walk and carry my baby at the same time because there is a 100% chance that I will fall or drop her. So I arranged for my mother to move in with my boyfriend and me when I got pregnant, because her fixed-income housing got a new  landlord who constantly found reasons to raise rent, and when she moved out, he kept a $900 security deposit over replacing a patch of carpet. I told her to sue, but she ""didn't want to make waves"".

So my daughter, A, is six months old now, and I've learned my mother is very passive-aggressive. But the main thing I want to talk about is this: she kept all her friends and church in the old town, which is 45 minutes away, and goes back there for entire evenings (4-6 hours) about 3 to 4 nights a week. Sometimes, she turns her phone off, even. My boyfriend is a high school teacher, and thus has lesson planning, assignment making, and grading to do most evenings, resulting in about 2-3 hours of work an evening for him. He wants to help with the baby as much as he can, but he DOES have work to do, resulting in the fact that if Mom leaves, he effectively can't work until she gets back if A is having a bad evening due to acid reflux pain or constipation.

As A has gotten older, I've noticed my mother has started doing less and less to help with the baby. She's gone from doing 2-3 of the feedings a day to 1 or none. She'll do little things, like dress A and change some diapers. But I no longer trust my mom to bathe her, as she'll do so in the baby tub sling A has outgrown and that's unsafe. I told her to move the toddler tub to the adult tub rather than the sink (it doesn't fit in the sink) but my boyfriend's told me if I go to bed early Mom will still do it in the sink.

My main crux is this: Mom goes out of town 3-4 nights a week for elongated periods of time. But if I want, say, two hours of  baby-free time, I have to beg and have a good reason for it, like wanting to take a nap or do chores. It's not good enough to want some time to read or play video games. I just know that if I ever press the issue, Mom will say something like ""Well, you're the mother. You should have figured you'd have to sacrifice for the child.""

I've already made arrangements with my mother to play Dungeons & Dragons twice a month, but I also want to stream six hours a week, and she almost made me choose between the streaming and the D&D.

She goes out so much, and I never stop her, and the couple of times I suggested it was a bad idea to go out when A was already getting fussy and upset, Mom got angry and pouted. But all I want sometimes is just to ask for two hours a day away from A so I can catch up with friends too and catch up on my hobbies. Is that really too much to ask for?",False,False

But basically we’re both in our last year and we’ve been applying to plenty of schools. However, I’ve been having a ton of trouble thanks to starting off high school kind of rocky.  
I really had to hustle with standardized testing and taking honor classes to boost my GPA so I’d stand somewhat of a chance when applying since I can’t get in anywhere based on grades alone.   
But this year, I’ve started applying to every school I thought I stood a chance at. I had been thinking about college for years before that; what I wanted to study and I heavily researched all the schools.  
I started getting letters back. I got rejected from my top school, which had been my dream for years, it totally blew my self esteem to the floor.   
My boyfriend, on the other hand, got average grades, never wanted to even talk about college until a few months ago, got accepted into every school I was applying at.   
At first, I was happy for him. I celebrated with him, I told him how proud I was, because I am. But then he tells me he’s not planning on going to any of these schools at all, and is gonna go to Community college instead. Why would he apply in the first place? 
Now this morning he showed me his acceptance letter to a school I’m going to have to have an interview with since my grades aren’t enough(he knows this). I glossed over it, and now he’s mad that I didn’t congratulate him. AITA for not celebrating his acceptance?",False,False
0,"AITAH for telling my friend she used me when she didn't pay back the money I loaned her? | My friend's husband was diagnosed with cancer (he's a dick btw alcoholic, emotionally abusive, jobless) and she has been the sole provider of her family of 3.  He's been collecting unemployment for some time now.  So, when he was diagnosed with cancer she had to take FMLA which ate up her PTO.  They started a go fund me page to help with bills and got I think approximately $500.  I decided to give her $600 no strings attached.  

She texted me one day saying work had fucked up her check so her check was almost nothing.  I asked what happened to the go fund me money and she say that it was gone and they were still waiting on her husband's disability to go through.  I asked if she needed a loan and she said if I could she would appreciate it and asked for another $600.  I had the extra money and so I told her I could loan it to her and she could pay me back when she could.  

So a year passes.  Her husband's in remission and she hasn't even tried to pay me back yet.  I'm being patient but then she starts talking about getting a tattoo and buying a new dog and all I can think of is wtf you can afford all this stuff but you can't afford to pay me back even just a little.  

It comes to a head when her husband brought home a new dog and she acts like she's not happy about it but at the same time is showing off pictures at work of the dog saying how cute she is.  I'm a bit on fire now and text her asking if she's ever going to pay me back.  She texts back that she keeps telling her husband they need to but he doesn't listen.  I then proceeded to tell her that she just used me to which she called me a bitch and a shitty friend.  

Two days later she pays me back in full.  I'm not sure where the money came from but I took it.

1,"AITA for saying no to my 12 year old on a sleepover? | A bit of scene setting before I get to the point. My wife and I both work full time. We have two sons, 12 and 10. Two weeks ago we got two puppies. Things are hectic. 

As the end of the summer nears and my son’s friends return from various summer trips, my son asked my wife and me for a sleepover this coming Wednesday. Wife deferred to me and I said no. 

See, my wife is working late on Wednesday. I am working normal hours meaning I’ll be home around 5;30. We have a nanny but she expects to leave around the time I get home. Kids would already be at our house when I arrive. So I’d be in charge of 5 kids and two puppies until my wife got home (earliest 7 PM but almost certainly more like 8 or later). Even for a couple hours it’s a two-parent thing or chaos will take over. 

So as soon as I say no, my wife and son start bargaining with me about why it should be fine to do Wednesday, it’s not that big of a deal. Ends with my wife saying “you’d can’t just be a parent for one night?” implying, of course, that I’m not any other nights. This is important because to me, my decision was made in the name of good parenting. They can have the sleepover another night.

1,"AITA for bringing up my ED and making a long car ride tense? | I’m a college student and I share an apartment with two other girls. I was close with one of them last year, and we still get along well, but we haven’t talked or hung out much since moving in together. Despite this, I’ve still been comfortable enough to speak to her openly about my struggles in the past with my weight and she follows my finsta where I’ve vented about my eating disorder a few times. Since the beginning of the semester, I’ve barely eaten anything, rarely leave my room, and often skip classes. These are all things that I thought would be noticeable to her as she never sees me eating, or really at all, when she’s home and we share a lot of classes, so she’d be aware of my absence. We also share food storage space and dishes so it’s very clear that I’m not eating frequently if at all. I still decided to give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that she didn’t know that anything was wrong and that’s why she hadn’t said anything to me. 

Last weekend our spring break started and she asked me if I could give her a ride home. I usually drive her back for most breaks so I said yes like usual. We talked a bit during the drive about classes and music, but it was really eating away at me (no pun intended) that I had been suffering so much recently with no support at home and she seemed oblivious to it. I said a few things related to my weight to see how she would react (asking if my jawline was more defined, talking about how my clothes weren’t fitting me anymore) but she would give short responses and didn’t carry on those conversations. I realized that if I really wanted to talk about my struggles with her then I had to be open and straightforward, so I told her that I had been starving myself since I’d been back at school. She didn’t reply so I asked her if she had noticed because I didn’t feel like anyone had. She told me that she did, but that it wasn’t her place to say anything. After that, she didn’t say anything else about it and I didn’t either. We didn’t talk for the rest of the drive aside from me asking about gas stations and directions. 

I feel really upset and hurt that my roommate noticed that I was having a serious problem but avoided saying anything to me or offering me any support even if it was indirect. I thought after expressing to her how it bothered me that nobody realized what was going on that she would ask if I wanted to talk about it at least, but she seemed like she didn’t care at all. She hasn’t reached out since to say anything to me so I can assume that’s the case.

She sometimes goes with them to a bar, eventhough i cant be there. As well one of my friends is regulary visiting her at home. IM NOT AFRAID THAT SHE WILL CHEAT ON ME WITH ONE OF MY FRIENDS, i just dont like it that they hang out so much. I have told it to her many times, but she just doesnt  get it and always come with excuses with how and why they met.

0,"AITA for telling my mom she was a bad mother? | So this is kind of a two part thing. A while back, I made my mother upset because of a couple different things I said while out with her. She was saying something about how she didn't believe in doctors and that my siblings literally beg her to go and she still puts off taking them as long as possible. I told her that's not okay, that she did that to me and I nearly died (I was hospitalized for weeks, and spent several months on bedrest recovering), and that if she keeps that up one of us really might die some day because of her. She didn't take that too well, but ended up dropping it and brushing it off as no big deal. 


Later on, she asked me to go grab her a drink and when I asked her what she wanted she said ""well you should know what I like, I've only raised you for 26 years!"" And I told her no, I do not know what you like, my grandparents raised me, I still don't know anything about you. She got upset and started crying and said ""what's your problem!? This is the second time today that you've been mean to me and tried to make me seem like a bad person!"" I told her I'm not trying to be mean I was just saying it's not cool to not take your kid to the doctor and that I'm not going to know anything about her since I didnt grow up with her. 


We ended up going home shortly after and went out again the other night, a few weeks later. Well I got my brother a phone because they kept taking his (that a different family member pays for) and I wanted him to have his own, so I made it clear they can keep his other one and this one is STRICTLY for him. Well I found out they've been taking and using this one too, so when I saw her I told her, seriously, I dont want to take the phone back because I don't want him to be punished for what you're doing, but I will take it back if you don't stop stealing it from him. That is HIS that I'M paying for, not you, it is not yours to touch, it's already bad enough that you keep all his work money at least don't touch his phone. She got upset and starting yelling and crying saying I need to stop treating her like a bad mother, and I told her well to be honest she kind of IS one. She had a meltdown and started sobbing and said well fine, I don't need you in my life anyways, and left without me. Now my family is saying I shouldn't of treated her like that even if she wasn't that great to me. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for refusing to attend my college graduation? | I'm not the sort of person who goes to such ceremonies or puts much importance on them. I always thought graduations were boring too. My high school made a big fuss about how getting your diploma at the ceremony does not mean you graduated, the reason being many students still needed summer classes. This did not apply to me but I kind of interpreted it as the graduation ceremony being meaningless and there was no point in me going. My parents really wanted me to go, soy mom made an offer of sorts: go and she wouldn't ask me to attend my college graduation. So I did and just was happy to get all the gifts from relatives that I got.

As my actual college graduation approached my mom starting telling me that ""it would be kind of nice"" to go to a graduation and that ""she'd appreciate it"" and she even offered to pay for my cap and gown if I did. This pissed me off and I told her that she promised be in high school she wouldn't ask me, her reply was she was short sighted then since like me she saw college graduation as so far off. She then basically said if I went that this would be the last time I'd ever have to be in a graduation ceremony. When I asked about what if I went to grad school she replied that she ""promised for real this time"" she wouldn't ask me to go to that. (I had not yet applied to at the time or now to go to grad school. It's not ruled out but not currently planned on.) I angrily berated her a bit and told her she already promised me that and that ""there was no fucking way I was going to that stupid fucking ceremony."" In response I heard her tear up a bit and she told me fine and didn't ask me again. Yeah I got upset and kind of emotional there but as said I've always found graduations boring and would really not enjoy going. 

I did not attend my graduation. I merely received my degree in the mail. Still I feel kind of bad but she was also guilting me into something she already promised me she wouldn't do. Was I an asshole?",False,False

1,"AITA for asking my friend to not invite my ex to his wedding? | My ex and I were high school sweethearts and we were together for around 6 years. We started dating in high school and we stayed together in uni since we were in the same city, then we broke up a few months after we graduated. If it matters, I broke up with him. This was in 2012 and we literally haven't seen each other or talked since but we still have some mutual friends from high school and uni.


One of those mutual friends got married last month and I was in the wedding party. When he and his fiance were putting together the guest list I asked them not to invite my ex. Weddings are hard enough when you're single and I really just wanted to celebrate and enjoy my friend's wedding in peace. I didn't want to stress about running into my ex and his new wife all night. They understood and they did not invite my ex to their wedding. 


Recently I was hanging out with some friends and my ex got brought up and someone asked why he missed the wedding. The bride explained he wasn't invited because of me. I saw some of the other people exchange glances with each other like it was weird. But no one actually said anything to me.


One of my best friend is getting married at the end of the year on NYE and I'm a bridesmaid and I asked her to not invite my ex to her wedding for the same reasons. They haven't sent out invitations yet but as far as I know he will not be invited.


I feel like since I'm in the wedding party it's not unfair of me to ask my friends for this favor so I don't feel uncomfortable. I probably wouldn't have asked them if I was just a regular guest. Also I'm much closer friends with the couples getting married than my ex is and I think if they really wanted him to be there then they wouldn't have uninvited him just because I asked.",False,False
0,"AITA? GF calls me fat, I ask her to stop and she calls me a dick. | So here's a bit of backstory: (first REAL post, sorry for format issues) TLDR at the bottom.

My girlfriend of three years has a lot of issues with her weight. I assure her that she isn't fat, which is true and she is very skinny, but she still insists that she is *huge* and needs to lose weight to feel better about herself. Now, I'm an overweight fella and it makes me VERY self-conscious, but I never bring it up to her because I know it would make her more upset. 

My girlfriend has been sending me posts via Instagram about weight loss pills, fad diets, etc. This has been going on for months and she often asks if I will help her go on diets, if I will buy her pills, etc. I have agreed multiple times to try and diet with her but she always gives up and says that I think she's fat when I try to push her to keep going. I always say no to buying diet pills (no FDA regulation). 

When she sends me the various Instagram posts, it makes me really upset. I feel like she's sending them to me because she thinks that I am fat and need these diets and stuff. (Imagine someone sending you a ton of weight loss info with no context because that is essentially what happened.)

Today, I finally asked her to stop sending me the posts because it was making me upset and I felt like she thought I was overweight. She responded angrily.

GF: ""You're such a dick""

Me: ""I'm sorry. It makes me upset and I don't like it""

GF: ""Fine. I'm just going to stop talking to you at all because it makes you upset""

Me: ""When you send me the diet stuff it makes me really self-conscious GF. If you want to go on a diet that is fine and I will support you but please be aware that you are hurting me with some of the stuff you send""

GF: ""Yep.""

Me: ""It feels like you're saying I need to try that stuff and that hurts me a lot"" 

GF: I'm talking about me. It's not always about you.""

At this point, I stopped replying because I didn't want to argue anymore. I really feel like she overreacted and made me out to be the bad guy saying I don't support her. Am I the asshole here? I really feel like she is in the wrong and should have just apologized and stopped sending me stuff. I really want to hear everyone's opinion on this.

TLDR: Girlfriend sends me diet information. I tell her to stop because it makes me upset and makes me feel like she thinks I'm fat. She calls me a dick.

1,"AITA for telling people that my brother didn’t actually care about my grandmother? | My grandmother passed away, and we just buried her yesterday. She was 89. 

She was pretty independent up until a fall that made her less mobile. My aunt took care of her in the final year. 

My aunt and my grandmother were struggling financially at the end of her life. I would say my brother and I are both financially stable. I would often float them money to get food, medication, etc. But when they called him, they got radio silence. 

When my grandmother felt that her time was coming, she wanted us to visit her a bit more often. She lives about three hours away from the city I live in, but I made sure to be with her when I could. My brother lives two hours away, and didn’t see her for the entire year. When I saw her she would ask me if he was mad at her, and why he didn’t call. 

So it was a surprise to me when he began acting hysterical at her funeral. He was crying, he was screaming. He held onto her hand and sobbed when they opened the casket. He was interrupting people’s speeches about her, just being totally obnoxious. He even tried to throw himself on the casket when they were lowering it into the ground. 

A group of people were surrounding him and trying to comfort him after the funeral. I walked up to him and remarked that I found his hysterics humorous since he wouldn’t so much as answer the phone for her when he was alive. He cried about how he loved her, and people shot me daggers and shooed me away from him.

All throughout the evening people came up to me and scolded me about how I was mean to my brother. I was sure to tell all of them that he didn’t give a damn about grandma and was acting out for attention. 

People gave me the cold shoulder for the rest of the evening. They told me to have compassion because I am the older sibling. I think he’s an asshole and being an attention whore. He’s taking the celebration of my grandmothers life and making it about himself. Who is the asshole here?",False,False
0,"AITA for wanting to re-home my moms dog? | Back story: 9 months ago my mother had some severe health issues and landed in the ICU for two weeks. Because she was sick and couldn’t work, she shortly afterwards became homeless. My husband and I offered to foster her dog for three months while she got back on her feet. We live in a studio apartment with our own dog and one cat. Now mind you, my mother’s dog is an extremely overweight lab/mastiff breed. When we took him on he easily weighed 275lbs and could hardly move. Fast forward 3 months and he’s been on weight loss foods, been to the vet and even lost enough weight he can run and jump. His three months was up and my mom was no where to be found. She didn’t come to collect him, kept ignoring our calls and eventually said if she came to get him, he would go to the pound because she was still homeless and had no permanent home. Naturally we didn’t want this to happen to the dog so he stayed with us for another 3 months. Loosing more weight and regaining his mobility. By now he’s become a distant member of our little family and all is good. The 6 month period rolls around and once again, my mother dodges calls. Avoids situations that might involve her dog and ignores us. Fast forward to the 9 month mark and he’s still here. But so is my mom now. I’m sure you can imagine the chaos of three adults, two large dogs and one cat in a studio apartment. She ended up on the streets again and winter is fast approaching so we told her she could stay temporarily. This also meant that she needed to take on the daily responsibilities for her dog, something that has been communicated to her multiple times. I’m currently 3 months pregnant, very ill with morning sickness and I’m still taking care of him because she refuses. My husband and I still feed and water him, take him outside, bathe him and brush him. All the while she’s been here, refusing to do any of it and sleeping all day or going out with her friends. My husband and I will be moving shortly and both them will have to leave then too. I’m concerned my mother won’t take her dog when we leave and because of her lack of responsibility for him in the last month I’m considering re-homing the dog. Does this make me an asshole?

0,"AITA for accusing my daughter’s teacher of racism and getting her fired. | My daughter is 9 and just started going to a new school in January because we moved. It is a public school in an urban city which is quite multicultural. She is half-Chinese and half-white. Although she is part Chinese, not many people can notice. Some have thought that she is Italian or Greek or even Irish for some reason.

Anyways, a month and a bit ago, my daughter came home a bit sad. I asked her what was wrong and she told me that in school, everyone shared what they did for the weekend. My daughter said that her family is Chinese so they celebrated Chinese New Year. The teacher (who is white) apparently told her “But you’re not Chinese. You shouldn’t lie.” My daughter said she felt embarassed in front of the whole class.

I was amused but also angry. I phoned her teacher and VERY CASUALLY told her that my daughter felt hurt by her being dismissive of her heritage. Her teacher was strangely defensive and asked me if I was accusing her of something. I said no and just that she should try being more open minded. 

A few days after this incident, my daughter said she felt like the teacher was treating her unfairly, namely refusing to let her go to the water fountain during class, giving her a “time out” for not lining up in time for recess, putting her on the spot to answer a question and berating her when she had the wrong answer. This time both my husband and I booked an appt to talk with the teacher, who was quite dismissive of us and very unhelpful. 

At this point it was affecting my daughter’s enjoyment of school. She would cry at night and beg me to send her back to her old school. Finally I had a talk with the principal, who told me that other parents have been accusing the teacher of racism in the past and said they’re trying to work with her. In the meantime my daughter was transferred to another class which worked out great.

Flash forward to last week when I was picking up my daughter from school. Her old teacher approached me and we made a bit of small talk, then she said casually, “Well Im not going to return to teach next year so I guess I can thank you.”

I was super taken aback. I told her I did NOT mean for her to lose her job. She then walked away from me.

I also learned from another parent that she was 4 kids and is a single mom. This made me extremely sad and I can’t help but feel guilty for playing a role in having her fired. My husband told me she was probably gonna get fired anyways and said I shouldn’t feel bad.

AITA though? I feel so so horrible knowing that she cannot support her 4 kids anymore partially because of my complaint against her.

0,"AITA for refusing to date a man who has three baby mamas? | I'm posting because I'm getting very divergent feedback about this from close friends. I am a 38-year old divorced woman with a 4-year old son. I recently began online dating (we divorced about 2 years ago) and signed up for a Match profile. I of course mention my son and that I'm divorced in my profile. So far I've gone on a few casual dates, but I am eventually looking for something serious. I would prefer to get into a relationship with a man who also has children because 1) I want to be with someone who won't be surprised about what parenting actually entails and 2) I would be less worried about being pressured to have another biological child (I have a history of infertility). 

&#x200B;

So I began talking to a man I met on Match, 36 years old, who has three daughters. His kids are a bit older than mine; they are 16, 13, and 12. After some correspondence, we met up for our first date. I was enjoying myself and our conversation, and found myself attracted to him. 

&#x200B;

Then we began talking about our kids. We talked about our custody arrangements with our exes. The man said that he had joint custody with his younger two girls, but his oldest daughter lives out of state. I was confused as to why he had different arrangements for his kids. Turns out he has not one, not two, but three women that he has had children with! (And he has not been married to any of them.)

&#x200B;

When he told me this, I immediately knew I wasn't going to see him again. My ex and I are friendly, and even we have challenges with the co-parenting thing. Negotiating co-parenting as a potential stepmother with three different women (if we were to get to that point) is just not something I want to take on. I'm really not looking for a NSA relationship, so I thought why lead this guy on?

&#x200B;

We parted ways after the date and I didn't say anything then, because I thought maybe he didn't even like me all that much and it would be a moot point. Well of course, he texted me the next day asking me out again. I tried to ghost him for a couple of days, but he called me out. So I finally responded saying that unfortunately I didn't think I could get involved with someone who has children with three different women, due to the logistical challenges all of the communication and arrangements must pose in his life. He hasn't responded.

&#x200B;

Some of my friends say I am being judgmental and making assumptions. They ask whether I would be upset if someone refused to date me because I have ""baggage"" (a son and being divorced). Other friends say that it makes sense I wouldn't want to get involved with someone with this much baggage, as I have to think about my son first and foremost. So, AITA?

The first day when I moved in, I found my room and realized that Dave had been there for an entire day before the official move in day and had taken over half of the room for all of his stuff. I didn’t say anything tho because I didn’t have much of my own stuff so it really didn’t bother me. 

Now, me and Dave got along fine, but in total silence.  At first I tried to at least exchange pleasantries, good morning, how was your day, etc, but I hardly ever got more than short one word responses so I gave up. 

At some point like halfway into the semester, the RA has to do a check of our rooms to make sure we aren’t hiding pets or drugs or anything like that.

I had loose papers everywhere, there were wrappers all over my desk and receipts from fast food places everywhere but I was always really careful never to actually leave food anywhere. The RAs comments made me worry that I might be making Dave uncomfortable with my messiness so I asked him if he was bothered by it, and he said, “ Nah, it’s cool.”  So I tidied up a tad bit, but not much.

It was really embarrassing for me and I got mocked at school because of this cause my parents were almost 40 by then (38 an 39) My mom also had PPD after she had him and had to take an additional three months leave after her paid maternity leave from work ended. So right after she had him, our life kind of went downhill. My dad had to quit gym cause we could no longer effort it and I had to start using money from my part time job to continue accessing the tennis court at the community center (before I only used that money to eat out, buy random stuff at the mall etc). Then after going back to work for a few months she decided that she would switch to part time work so for the past two years I've had to tone down my spending and my parents always goes on about how having a baby is expensive. 

My brother can also be annoying at times. He always tries to play with me and show me drawings and stuff like that. I do love my brother. He's cute and sometimes I take him to the park and  I do like spending time with him in moderation. But honestly, I wish my parents didn't have him. I ended up missing out on some trips and other experiences because my parents chose to have him. 

Yesterday I was talking to my mom about something and somehow we got to the topic of my birth control and my mom was telling me that when I go away to college later this year, I should always be safe etc etc. And for some reason, I just snapped at her and told her that maybe she should've thought about this three years ago and maybe I shouldn't take advice from her since she clearly doesn't know what she was talking about. I told her that having my brother was a mistake and that I resent her for it. She got upset and said I shouldn't talk to her like that and that it was an awful thing to say etc etc.

She must have told my dad what I said because he has asked me to apologise to her and said I was out of line for saying that. He also suggested that I should talk to my school therapist about this cause he thinks I have pent up anger. I think that's just them trying not to admit that having my brother was a mistake and was unfair on me. I don't want to apologise to her cause I only told her the truth.

1,"AITA for insisting that my wife keep the ""traditional"" way of addressing married couples on our wedding invitations? | My fiancee, 29F, and I, 33M, are getting married. Our wedding planner is helping us create the invitations. My family is a very old school, traditional one, and the weddings of my older siblings have always reflected the traditionality. In all their invitations, married couples were referred to as ""Mr. and Mrs. John Smith"", or similar. Unmarried women have ""Miss"" in front of their names.

However, my fiancee wants to break away from this tradition by listing the names of each person separately. E.g. ""Mr. John Smith and Ms. Mary Smith"". I told her that it sounds clunky and weird. Then she brought up the fact that her mother never took on her father's surname (not a thing in her culture), and it would be weird to address her with his full name. She also wants to replace ""Miss"" and ""Mrs."" with ""Ms."" for all women.

I told her that I would advise against doing so. My grandmother, who is very elderly and nearly 100, may take offence because we have used the same invitation template/style since she got married. AITA for suggesting that we keep the tradition intact?

EDIT: Hehe, technically ""fiancee"" not ""wife"". Jumping the gun a bit :)",False,False
1,"AITA because I booked a trip for my daughter and I when my parents didn't pay as much for I thought they would? Now my wife is pissed. I had no idea they wouldn't give me half. | My wife suggested earlier this year that my daughter and I visit my parents in August. My parents live in Malta (not really but I'd rather no one be able to ID me by chance). 

In January, ticket prices were $1600ish for my daughter and I.

The prices shot up to $2000 because we didn't book. The trip was effectively cancelled as a result.

A few weeks passed and on a Skype call with my mom, she mentions to me that she will pay for half the trip. Cool. Great! Thanks! 

I tell this to my wife and she books the trip for my daughter and I (she's the type A, she insisted on doing the booking).

Now my parents are visiting us. My mom approaches me yesteday and gives me $500 and some local currency. Quite a bit actually. I say thank you.

I tell my wife and she becomes angry, starts crying and tells me I manipulated her in booking this trip under false pretense. 

The pretense, of course, being that my parents would pay for half when in fact, they ""only"" payed about 1/4 of the trip, arguably 1/3 with the other currency. 

She starts going off on how she can't afford this with her Amex card. How she wouldn't have done any shopping today if she knew we'd only get $500 towards the trip. 

Am I supposed to go to my mother and say ""This isn't enough money. We agreed on half. This is 1/4.“?  I think that's pretty damn generous to begin with. 

Is my wife out to lunch here? Am I the asshole? I mean, I can't look a gift horse in the mouth. I consider this very nice of my parents. 

We aren't broke as a couple, my wife and I, but yes, this trip IS gonna stretch us a tad when all is said and done. I also receive retroactive pay each year when my raise goes in in January which is usually a couple of grand.

1,"AITA for getting mad at my mom for bringing her boyfriend? | Today was the day of my (24 F) first time hosting a bridal shower and my mom was going to come help me set up for it because she was also making the cake for it.  

My dad passed away three years ago and my mom started dating this past January. She's been dating and she's gotten ghosted by a couple guys after one or two months. I have told her before that I don't want to meet any of her boyfriends until she's dated them for at least three months. Let's be honest, this isn't easy for me because she doesn't have many friends so she tries to talk to me about dating like I'm her best friend, not her daughter. The past few months I've been changing the subject, etc, when she brings up guys because it honestly makes me upset to have these conversations with her. She's been dating this one guy for about a month now, maybe two, I'm not sure exactly. But after the first weekend she was saying ""I think this one could go the distance"". Which is the same thing she's said about the other two guys that ghosted her.

This morning when she comes to help me set up she's coming in the door with her boyfriend. He's dropping her off and they let my dog out, so I have to go run and chase my dog down and I come back with dog in hand, mom introduces her boyfriend, I shake his hand and go back inside. This was all very rushed trying to get the dog back in the house and keep trying to set up for the party that was happening in two hours and I was not very warm.

Mom comes inside and her boyfriend has left and all I say is ""a heads up about the boyfriend would have been nice, but we'll talk about this another time."" in a not so nice tone.

On top of all this, she told me, out of the blue, earlier this week that she plans to sell the house by the end of the year. The only house I've known as home from birth until college, and the one her and my dad built (I haven't lived there since college).

0,"AITA for letting a 4 year old cut the line for the bathroom at a bar? | Yesterday, July 3, I (21F) went out with a group of friends (21F) to a brewery which happened to be in an area with a family friendly firework show going on. Me and 2 of my girl friends had to pee so we hopped into the very long line for the women's restroom. As we got to the front, a group of pretty drunk women got in line behind us. When we reach the front of the line (\~15 minutes later) a mom and her young daughter come up to us and the mother politely asks if her daughter can use the restroom before us. The mom and daughter obviously came from outside watching the fireworks. The mom said she tried to make her daughter use the portapotty outside but she refused. Well, the women behind us had a big problem with this. They made multiple snarky comments like ""your daughter can wait in line like everyone else"" and eventually one of the women targeted us saying ""you ladies have a lot to learn"" ??? Seeing that the young girl literally had her hand over herself to stop herself from peeing, we still ended up letting the mom and her daughter go before us. She literally took less than 2 minutes to pee and then my friends and I went in together to make the line move a little quicker for everyone else. Eventually we got back to the rest of our group and one of our friends was on the other ladies' side. She claims that the little girl probably has the ""strongest bladder out of all of us"" and that she should've used the portapotty when she had the chance.

0,"AITA For Giving My Coworker a Taste of His Own Medicine? | I work in a customer service job but not one where it's expected to tip but our card receipts have a tip line on them since we sell food.

Backstory: Last week I rang up this large party and got them all settled and started a tab for them expecting a food server to pick it up when they ordered food. The party didn't order food so the check remained in my name which is common. This coworker of mine then put the check under his own name to cash them out and the person paying ended up writing in a $30 tip (the biggest tip I had seen before this was maybe $10).
Since the check was now under his name my coworker believed the $30 was his and claimed that he got taxed on it so it was his. I tried pointing out that I had done at least 2/3 of the work by getting them settled and it was my check to begin with so he should share the tip with me. He claimed I was being petty but did give me like $5.

This week I was cashing out one of this coworker's checks under his name for him and the customer put in a $10 tip. Another coworker of ours said that I should put it under my name and keep it for myself since I cashed them out (although I hadn't gotten them settled). I agreed and did that though the first coworker found out and is now saying it's messed up and I'm being petty for doing it.

1,"AITA for not paying my sister for food I ate? | Throwaway because people know my main.

Anyways, I live with my sister and we are both adults. I moved in 1 and a half months ago after my old roommates got us evicted and I had nowhere else to go. I didn't have any savings so she said I could move in and she'd give me a couple months to pay her retroactively for rent and bills. Rent + bills is like 850 a month so I owed her for part of last month, all of this month, and then of course June rent and bills are coming up. I've given her like $800 so far. She also paid the movers so I am paying her back for that too. It's a lot. I've given what I can spare right now but I got a raise at work so we should hopefully be square in a month, or so I thought.

Now she's trying to tell me that I owe her for taking my clothes to the laundromat, the food that I ate, and because I drank a couple bottles of her wine. She is seriously tacking on more to what I owe her and yes she did pay for all of that, but she never SAID I had to pay her for it. I just assumed I'd buy groceries sometimes after I pay her back.

This all came out because I sent her $100 yesterday and I tried marking down that I paid her the $100. She said no, it was only $30 because we went to the grocery store afterwards and we got $100 worth of stuff but $70 of it was mine. I said it was meant to share but she said she didn't want the kind of stuff I bought. To be fair, it isn't really the kind of stuff she gets for herself, but the stuff I ate of hers wasn't the stuff I'd get for myself either.

Then she tells me that if I want to count the whole $100 to what I owe, that she is going to make me pay for everything I had the past month and a half. Like, seriously, two bottles of wine for $80! Lunch meat that is $13/lbs?? I think she is being insane if she expects me to pay that much, especially since I told her she can eat what I got but she doesn't want to because it's ""cheap"" in her words.

0,"AITA for breaking up with my therapist over the phone? | About 9 months ago I (26F) went through a bout of debilitating Anxiety. 

I tried to go through my health insurance but their mental health services are limited, it would take weeks to see a therapist. Because I was in a “crisis” my parents sent me to a private therapist who is 140/hr., which my parents are paying for. 

Throughout the 9 months I never felt a connection nor did I feel like her “process” worked for me. I felt worse after a lot of my therapy sessions, and was having anxiety just thinking of going. But I stuck it out because I know therapy can be uncomfortable and thought maybe I was the problem.

About three weeks ago my therapist went on vacation and then I couldn’t go the week after meaning I went two weeks without therapy. It was amazing. 

After this I talked to my parents about taking a break to make sure I wasn’t making a rash decision. They understood my positions and supported my decision. I then called my sister who is a therapist and asked what the protocol was to end the relationship. She told me a phone call is perfectly fine.

On Monday I called my therapist, I left a short voicemail saying I was thinking of taking a break and for her to call me back to discuss. She then texted me asking if I would come in for an assessment because she doesn’t think it’s a good idea to walk away from something without making a conscious choice. I texted her back saying this was a conscious choice and that I didn’t want my parents paying $140 for an assessment session. I told her I would be more than willing to have a phone session with her.

About 30 minutes later she calls me and she basically bullies me into seeing her one more time because this her “process” and how she gets closure with her clients. She said something to the effect of “it really says something about how you view your relationships if you can end this over the phone”. After that comment I told her she was making me feel bad and I explained that I asked my sister what the protocol was to end a client-therapist relationship. The conversation went on for over 10 min. I was pretty clear on a final session being a waste of my time and MONEY. But she wouldn’t let it go. In the end, to get her to stop, I told her I would come in next Tuesday, but I’m going to cancel with a nice text explaining once again why one last session is a waste of time and money.

1,"AITA for choosing to live with my dad, who cheated on my mom, after their divorce just because he's rich? | So I'm 18, but the school I attend has a cutoff date of June 1 and I'm born on June 28, I'm going into senior year of high school. But since I'm an adult legally I got to choose which parent to live with.

For some background info, my dad's a tech exec and my mom's a therapist. Neither is poor in their own right, but my dad's income obviously dwarves my mom's by a lot. He wasn't a bad father by any mean, but he was sort of an absent one, since he was always working. I didn't particularly mind, since I was independant from a young age, but it caused my brother Jay [16M] to really resent him. My mom, on the other hand, always made time for us and was really caring and over all a really great mother. And when she found out our dad was cheating on her, she decided to divorce him. She got custody of Jay, and I had the choice of wherever I wanted. Everyone thought I would choose mom, but I chose dad instead. Why? He's rich.

See, again, my mom's not poor, but dad drives a Porsche and is in the process of buying a huge house with a pool. And he's never home, which suits me fine: I can stay up, invite friends over, throw parties, or in general whatever I want. And he also lets me spend money on stuff (within reason), so overall a pretty nice life. 

But Jay is incredibly mad at me for choosing to live with him, given he cheated on mom. I don't think I'm an asshole here, I just chose to live with whoever I thought could give me a better life.

0,"AITA for telling my ex-husband he's not a better dad? | Okay so bare with me on this one, I do feel like an asshole but now also relieved. My husband left me at the beginning of the year, he's been hit and miss with what he wants off me since then, but not entirely important.

I've made it very clear he can see our daughter (she's 2) every day after he finishes work if he wants, and then at weekends. He hasn't. He complains he misses her but rarely makes an effort. When he does, he'll see her for a few hours, that's it.  On ""his"" weekends he spends about 8 hours, max, with her in total.

He hasn't been there when she's not been very well, he doesn't even message to ask about her every day and puts his work first. When he did take her out, it was only to his parents and they would end up mainly looking after her.

So here's where I lost it, we had an argument on the weekend and he said this:

""I'm a better dad now that I'm not with you"".

I may have snapped like a twig and told him he's not a better dad. Pointed out he never sees her, he never makes the effort and he hardly even asks about her. He hasn't been there for her when she's not very well, he's not there when she's waking up from nightmares and doesn't have to deal with any of the hard times that comes with having a child anymore.

The only reason he ""feels"" he's a better dad is literally because he doesn't have to deal with the stress of being a parent anymore, he can come and go when he chooses.

When we were together he was very stressy with her, always losing his patience and getting annoyed at her.

0,"AITA for reporting a coworker over a pretty minor offense? | A few weeks ago I went to take my daily lunch-time pee at work when I was confronted with a female coworker (Alyssa) using a urinal. I was obviously shocked as I genuinely didn't know women could use a urinal, but nonetheless there she was. I reacted as you'd expect, along the lines of ""What the F***?!"" 

She explained the female stalls are always full at lunch and she had to go. She came in here to use a male stall and, when she saw they were all occupied as well, decided she had to use the urinal in a split second decision. Fair enough, I can see why she thought she had no other choice, but I still think it's extremely inappropriate for her to enter the male bathroom. She is an adult and should be able to manage her bladder absent any health condition (she doesn't have any that I know of).

I reported the incident to HR. My reasoning was that if she had a valid health reason, she could provide evidence to them. Otherwise, this was a inappropriate thing to do. As a result she was let go since people had made complaints against her in the past (not toilet related, presumably). A few female coworkers have apparently been calling me names behind my back saying what I did was pathetic, that she didn't have a choice, that I don't understand how unfair urinals are, etc.

My point of view is simple. If you're a healthy adult, control your bladder at the work place. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for apparently being ""unable to accept my husband as he is""? | I am married to the most generous, humble, kind hearted, gracious but non-talkative man I know. We have two girls and a boy together and things between us have been great in the past, but there has been an issue between us which we rugswept which I do want to hash out.

The issue being, where my husband is very quiet and withdrawn, I am sociable and outgoing. This has led me to struggles in trying to get him involved in a wide range of parties and events, I remember practically begging him to be involved with the dual wedding of my two sisters; where I begged him to at least attend the event and make small talk the guests and the grooms, he did at least attend, but he sat in the corner drinking a beer, brooding over I don't know what. It's always been like that with him, where I encourage him to break out of his shell and make new friends, he tells me he's not big on talking to people he doesn't know too well or like that much.

It's gotten to the point that our teenage son has told me that he wants to be closer to his father and taken to all sorts of fun boy stuff such as sports games and concerts. I take our girls out to do girl stuff all the time, and sometimes our son feels compelled to jump in the car with us to escape his father who he deeply loves but has admitted he finds boring.

I've questioned my husband if he may want to speak to someone about his isolating tendencies, but he repeatedly tells me he is fine, it's just who he is; as a child he was raised by loudmouths, so he doesn't feel too compelled to act out and that he has a ""perfectly extroverted wife"" to watch and admire as she deals with people. This simply isn't good enough for me; he's got so few friends and they pretty much all from work and he doesn't have any sort of social media, hobbies or anything. He just likes to be ""alone"", if alone is with the family or at home.

After finishing up dinner and the kids were sleeping, I talked to my older sister about this the other day on the phone . I just vented and she listened. I complained that my husband might have depression. I said that I was worried that he would never have a social life of his own outside of work. I was at this point, getting irritated and said ""God, I can't stand that loner sometimes"". This was heard by my husband who was upset about this statement. After the phone call, he had an angry tone in his voice and said ""why won't you just accept me as I am, Gem? Am I that unlikable to you that you need me out of the house or something? I like being a loner. I like being quiet and introverted. I already have you to balance this out. Why can't you just accept that?""

I backed off with making complaints about his loneliness and styed quiet as he scolded me for wanting him to change himself. He's been broody ever since this little argument. My sisters got the gist of it in subsequent phone calls and agreed that I shouldn't have been so forceful in wanting him to change. But AITA for just wanting him to be more social?",False,False

In late 2015 my sister also joined, because she was in high school and I was in university (my parents never used it so it made no sense to pay for it). Earlier this year I started splitting Netflix with some friends and agreed to pay for my sister's share for 3 months in exchange for a haircut. It now has been a year. At first I was fine with it because I was working and she was in university and didn't have any money but now, I am also looking for work and I can't keep supporting her when she makes no effort. She is a smoker which means she can always afford cigarettes but is always saying she doesn't have any money for Netflix. Today I told her that she had until the 18th of this month to decide if she wanted to pay a discounted rate every month or leave.

My wife is face-timing her sister today and she has the dang shirt on. She says, ""Yea, I took it that one night I slept there after that concert, it was super comfy so I kept it and wear it all the time"".............................

I said she needs to bring it back that I have been looking for it for two years (not everyday but I have wondered where the heck it is). My wife says I am being silly and it's just a t-shirt. I said it's kind of weird for someone to take a shirt and assume they can keep it.

So in that regard I believe stealing alcohol from my parents who don't drink is relatively acceptable. Well anyway we have a disgusting ""wine celler"" built into a rock wall that is completely disgusting, walls are coming apart, dirt, dead rats, live rats etc. Tons of wine in there, In fact my dad said he himself would steal wine from that very wine celler when he was a kid(he bought my grandparents house).  Anyway was in there looking for the bottles that quarks look intact and found a huge bottle of wine, about the size of 3 or 4 bottles, I thought that was a score and grabbed it. When I made it back to my room I saw a bunch of signatures from my parents wedding on it. So I'm kinda confused whether or not this is worse than just stealing wine, I mean its there wedding wine, but its been stored in an absolutely disgusting wine celler with dirt and dust all over it, which clearly shows they don't really care about the bottle.

Got myself a new car recently for which I don't have a registered entry tag yet so I'm technically obligated to use the guests side but from time to time I end up following in someone who enters in front of me from either side. 

This one time its late evening and I'm turning in to the community when I notice 2 cars coming in behind me. So I park my car in front of the guests gate anticipating to get in a few seconds behind one of them. 

The first car is a residents car and goes in through the right side and the gate is now wide open for the next one a Big SUV also a resident. The Big SUV guy decides he doesn't trust me so he parks the car right next to mine so I cant turn in and enter from the residents side then rolls down his window and gestures at me. This pissed me off and I felt like he was treating me like some low life criminal trying to get into the community unauthorized. So I honked my horn for him to move on but he obviously didn't get the message and kept gesturing shouting at me to get in. I punched in the entry code and got in but was cussing and gesturing at him while doing so. He didn't stop or retort but clearly went in feeling superior.

I work second shift, she works daylight, and I only see her for 2 days each week. It’s sucks. Last year, I was offered a daylight position (which is extremely rare in my line of work and likely won’t happen again for several years), but she suggested that I keep my 2nd shift job so that I’d be available to watch the baby during the day. This made total sense considering the cost of childcare. So, I gave up
the daylight position and stayed on 2nd shift to help out whenever the baby is born. 

Now, she wants to send our child to daycare anyway, which makes no fucking sense considering that the cost of which is going to be roughly $1000/month. She says that she wants to have peace of mind in knowing that there will always be someone to look after the baby. Despite this, we have multiple family members and friends to help if some unforeseen situation were to arise. Additionally, my boss is pretty flexible and would easily let me come in a few hours late if something happened, as long as I would stay later in order to make up for the additional time. Plus, I get a lot of PTO days, so this would never be an issue.

If the baby goes to daycare, which is conveniently located at my wife’s workplace, it means that I would only have 2 days each week to spend with her and the baby. So yeah, this depresses me and pisses me off because she’s expecting me to spend whole week alone when I could have been there every day with my family. Not to mention spending roughly $1000/month on childcare. 

I just told her how I felt over the phone since we rarely see each other, but she just remained silent when I expressed my feelings, as she usually does. I straight up told her that I honestly believe that she doesn’t care how I feel, then she hung up on me. Am I the asshole?",False,False
1,"AITA for instinctively pointing out my friend’s new boobs after having not seeing her for a while? | There’s this girl that was in my dorm hall freshman year. She’s also studying a similar major as me so we had at least a class together nearly every quarter. We’re fairly close and used to hang out platonically sometimes. She’s in a long distance relationship with her boyfriend from her hometown. We’re juniors now. I just came back from half a year of studying abroad. Yesterday was the second day of this particular class. I couldn’t come the first day because of a more important obligation but first days usually aren’t important anyways. So yesterday, I found a seat before class began. The aforementioned girl took the seat next to mine and said she didn’t know I was in this class. There are only about 30 students. 


The winters are mild where I live, so it wasn’t out of place that she was wearing a low cut tank top. She had always been pretty flat-chested. But it was obvious she got an enhancement while I was gone because they look like typical bolt-ons. I know it would have been extremely douchey of me if it were deliberate, but I was literally caught off guard because I was in my head when she greeted me and I turned my head to look at her and instinctively said “woah, those weren’t there before” in a little quieter than regular indoor speaking voice. She said “excuse me?” I said “I’m so so sorry. That just slipped out for some reason.” She said “you’re fucking gross” and moved to the only other empty seat left. I kept saying sorry but I didn’t want to make it any more awkward since class was full, although over half the class is from China so they probably wouldn’t get our exchange even if they paid attention. 


After class, I tried to explain to her that what I said was purely instinctive because I was caught off guard because I was thinking about something else when she greeted me and those words just slipped out of me also since the difference was so apparent. I promised that I’m not really a douchebag and know not to comment on boobs. She maintained her death stare and didn’t say anything after I stopped, so after 5 seconds, I asked her if she wanted to go get lunch with me. It was 12:30. She said she’d rather not and didn’t give me an excuse. She started to walk away and I power walked after her to tell her that I really didn’t mean to be perverted. She told me to leave her alone and walked away. 


I know she has the right to be creeped out and possibly embarrassed because we were in class, but I’m bummed out that she wouldn’t forgive me and see that I’m not that type of person. I really wanted to share my study abroad experience with her since she liked a lot of my study abroad Instagram pictures. She hasn’t posted any revealing pictures for a while on social media so I really didn’t expect that drastic change. I hope she’ll come around and forgive me by our class next Tuesday. She’s a really great person and one of my only friends in that class.",False,False
1,"AITA for not telling my husband where I want to order dinner? | This argument has lasted months. I would love to hear an outside perspective.

My husband and I have a 10 month old, we both work full time. I get home from work around 3 with the baby, my husband gets home around 5. On this day, my husband got home but had more work to do so he was at the kitchen table at his laptop. I was taking care of the baby and also getting things together for the next day: coffee pot, daycare bottles etc. During the first hour or so he was home, my husband asked what I wanted for dinner. He takes care of our dinners, whether it’s cooking 90% of the time or ordering. When he asked, I responded “ I don’t know.” I was busy, running after the baby and taking care of other house things. I wasn’t thinking about dinner. My husband kept working, but asked me two more times what I wanted for dinner. I didn’t have an answer, I didn’t feel a sense of urgency since he was still working and I also was busy and just didn’t care.

Husband was very upset that I didn’t say what I wanted for dinner. He says I was being dismissive because he was working later than usual. I swear that I did not care he was working, I was busy with the baby and didn’t even really notice. Husband says that asking me three times without a response was disrespectful and I was obviously pissed at him and just being rude. In my opinion, I just didn’t care and didn’t see the sense of urgency. I thought we were both busy and would figure it out later. Or if he was really hungry, he would say, “I’m ordering from ...what do you want”

I need an outside opinion! Hope you all respond!",False,False

When I returned to the display table, I noticed a small pair of bright pink kids' sunglasses, marked as $4.99. Perfect. I returned to the cashier, who said, ""I'm *pretty* sure these were __not__ the same price.""

Our landlord is super chill and hasn't raised the rent much in 4 years so we are paying well under market rate. As roommates leave (say they are paying $500) and new roomates come in we charge the new roommate the market rent (say $700)  and reduce all existing roommates rent evenly.

1,"WIBTA fo Euthanizing a Family Cat | I recently moved back home to take care of my mother, who has very advanced cancer and is almost completely bed bound. She requires assistance for everything, from going to the bathroom to having her meals prepared for her, and that subsequently takes up a lot of my time. Currently, there are four pets in the household: my dog, my mother's dog and cat, and my stepfather's cat. As a dog lover, I don't mind taking care of the dogs, and I also tolerate and take care of my mother's cat, which is 11 years old.

I can't stand my stepfather's cat, Samantha. She is 21 years old (equivalent to a 100 year old human), and all she does is scream for food, sleep, and occasionally vomit. Samantha wakes me up every morning at 6am with howls for food, since I sleep near the kitchen. Since I feed the other cat, I end up feeding Samantha, too, just to get her to shut up. She's had a good life, but at this point, in her advanced age, she is a nuisance. My stepfather refuses to euthanize her. He considers her his oldest friend, but he is also ver lazy with respect to her care, so my mother implores me to feed her. I also clean up the vomit, but the stepfather changes out the litter (not daily) for both cats.

WIBTA to euthanize her, and just make everyone assume she disappeared; i.e., wandered off to die or eaten by a coyote? She is an indoor/outdoor cat (daylight only).  I've also contemplated refusing to feed her, or shoving her into my stepfather's room so he deals with her. I am so stressed out about my mother's care, and this is just another aggravation. Three pets would be more manageable than four.

Edited to add that she also howls for attention, food throughout the day, and to get access to my stepfather's bedroom, which makes her overall an annoying cat. ",False,False
1,"AITA for expecting my daughter to be the best at something? | My daughter, let's call her Ellie, is 15. And it bothers me and my wife that she really isn't *into* anything. Her grades are average, and on top of that she does nothing at home aside from watching Netflix and being on her phone. She's not involved in anything, inside or outside school: no sports, clubs, art, music, anything. And my husband and I want her to be the best, or at least good, at something. The what doesn't really matter- it could be playing a sport, painting, debate, playing in instrument, math competition, writing, whatever. But we want her to be good at something, because currently she's basically aimless and has no hobbies other than tv and her phone. And we don't like that. 

We've been introducing her to everything we can- a bunch of sports, art stuff, instruments, etc. But she doesn't want to do anything and called us 'controlling'. I see my husband and I as the opposite. I'm not saying, 'you have to play tennis, like me', 'I was in the orchestra, you have to be in it too', or anything like that. We're letting her essentially choose whatever she wants to do, as long as she *does* something and is good at it. Because doing nothing isn't acceptable to us.

0,"AITA for defending a coworker who recently picked her smoking habit back up |  

Quick background here. I work in an office with a ten person department. I have one coworker (We'll call her Martha) who is 73 years old, and recently started smoking again after quitting years ago.

I'm (30M) a smoker, and I've cut back from two packs a day to just having two cigarettes a day. We have one other person who smokes, but very rarely smokes during work hours.

I came into work the other day and two of my coworkers had Martha cornered at her desk, and were putting her on blast for smoking again. Going on about how bad it is (which is true, but I've never met a smoker who wasn't already aware) and just generally being annoying about it AFTER being asked by Martha to drop the subject. A day later, they went into Martha's desk and hid her pack of smokes.

I eventually got tired of hearing them go on about it, and pointed out that Martha is an adult, she is fully aware of what she's doing, and that while I understand their concerns, they were crossing lines by going into her desk and harassing her whenever she walked out to smoke.

I was summarily put on blast by them, and was told I was only defending her because I also smoke, that I didn't care about her health, etc.

In my opinion, it's not our business what she does as an adult.

Two of them, Anna and Rachel, are struggling financially (Anna works as a waitress and Rachel can barely afford rent right now because her boyfriend just got laid off), so I reached out to them privately and said I would cover their hotel rooms for the two nights they'll be in town, the Friday night before the wedding and the night of the wedding. Rachel is bringing her boyfriend, so she'll be staying with him and Anna will be staying in a separate room. 

Anna apparently let it slip to the other girls that I was paying for their rooms, and now the other bridesmaids are really upset with me for not extending them the same offer. The rooms in the hotel where I'm getting married cost about $250 a night including taxes, and they say it's not fair that they have to pay $500 more than Anna and Rachel.

0,"AITA for NOT taking Jewish kids’ belongings? | In NYC subway train delays are common. I was commuting home on Friday evening and we got stuck underground for a while. 

Being Friday, the sabbath begins at sundown, and it was looking like sundown would happen while we were still stuck underground. 

A group of Orthodox or Hasidic (I don’t know the subcategories of Judaism) teenage boys asked if I lived near by and if I could take their cell phones, watches and money from them because they aren’t allowed to carry them once the sabbath began at sundown in the next few minutes.  He would then pick up the stuff on Sunday. He even offered to pay me for holding their things. 

I felt bad for the kids because their faith is obviously something very important to them and circumstances outside their control made it difficult to honor their spiritual practices.

At the next station, an overweight woman gets on the bus and decides to sit next to me. The problem is that she was not taking one seat like most people, she was taking ONE AND A HALF seats leaving me with almost no space to even breathe, let alone feel comfortable. I calmly ask her if she could move a little bit to the left. Her response, in a very condescending way: ""I don't have space"".

Today, while driving my wife and I to work we hit the usual rush hour traffic. We were in the left-most lane, and I saw a Sentra driving down the left shoulder, so I nosed out in front of him - half in and half out of the lane.

I blocked him for about 2 miles, where the traffic eased up and then returned to my lane. He then proceeded to swerve around in front of me on the road, get of the car, yell ""DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ME?!?!"" (I did) and charge my car. I safely merged into the next lane and kept on my way, but it was a scary situation.

My wife was upset and concerned for our safety, and after discussing we agreed that I shouldn't ""play batman"" when I have passengers with me, as it is not my place to decide that any additional risk is worth it for them. However, we disagree about doing it when I am alone. She thinks it is never okay because of the potential risk of a crazy person, while I am more of the opinion that you can't live your life afraid of assholes, and if there is something that upsets me or I think is wrong, that I should do what I can about it out of principle.

1,"AITA for booking two seats at a game when my friend was paying for it? | This has become a topic of much contention among my friend group and I could use some outside perspective.

My friend, let's call him Paul, had just gotten a promotion with bonus, and wanted to take some friends out to a baseball game to celebrate- his treat. This was a minor league game so the tickets weren't too expensive, about $40 each. There were eight of us going including Paul.

This is a bit embarrassing to admit, but it's necessary to understand the situation- I'm a big guy. I'm ashamed and I've been working on it. 

When it came time to buy tickets (which we did so at the booth right at the ballpark), I bought two. I've been to this park before and I have trouble fitting into the seats. I also know that you can lift up the armrest on one side to make a sort of double wide seat. I purchased two tickets because that's what I did- I used two seats, with the armrest up. We had a great time and it was nice to be able to sit without having my insides squeezed out.

A couple of days afterwards, Paul asked for receipts so he could make sure everything balanced up. (He paid with a card). That's when he saw that I bought two seats. He questioned me, I explained the situation, and he got really pissed off. He said it was rude to buy an extra seat on someone else's dime, I could have fit in a single seat if I tried, and even if I couldn't, the park was empty enough that I could have just picked up the armrest without buying the seat and the ushers would have been none the wiser. (I didn't know how full the park was at the gate so I bought two seats next to each other to be safe. I also feel that I should pay for a second seat rather than ""borrowing"" one if I'm going to use it.) He then said some hurtful things about my weight and ended the conversation.

I've offered to repay him for both tickets I bought but he is not responding. And now my friend group knows and is arguing about whether Paul is right to be angry.

1,"AITA for how I responded to my boyfriend asking to be consoled? | My boyfriend and I have lived together for most of our 2.5 year relationship. For logistical reasons, when our lease ended, it didn't make sense to stay in the same apartment. Since our relationship wasn’t going well, we decided that, rather than sign a new lease/move into a new apartment together right away, we'd first see if our relationship could improve. If things got better, we'd move back in together and continue on as before. If things got worse, we'd break up. For the last month, we live apart on weekdays but spend weekends together.

Today my boyfriend texted me that he missed me and was sad that we aren’t living together. He got mad at how I responded. I'm pasting the whole convo right here (it's not long) for your judgement.

Two pieces of background information. (1) I'm at work during this conversation (why I didn’t just call him). (2) When we lived together, my boyfriend used to frequently say that he ""hated"" our apartment, ""hated"" my furniture, thought our home was ""disgusting,"" wanted to move elsewhere. This used to hurt my feelings. With that, here goes:

Him: I feel really off today -- really sad and just like lethargic

Me: Why? I'm gonna walk across the street to get food, I'm starving. want me to call you?

Him: Yesterday's talk has been like repeating in my mind. Sure.

Me: What about it? I am here for you. Always.

Him: I feel incredibly sad and stressed. I really do.

Me: So what can we do to fix that? Or at least begin fixing it.

Him: I want to know/feel like I/we know what's going on, where we are, what we potentially see happening. I don't want to feel lost and unsure of what's the situation between us. I'm sad one day and happy the next.

Me: So what would be the first step in getting to that? In getting to that sense of security?

Him: To talk about where we are as a couple. I want to know what you're thinking/feeling and I want you to know what I'm thinking/feeling. And to then talk about what is next and if we have any plans in mind or can make some together.

Me: We can do that. It's sort of ironic, you saying that, because I felt like I had been begging for that from you and then I finally gave up and decided I'd let you initiate when you felt ready.

Him: Well I feel ready; I want to know what's going on and not feel lost.

Me: Well we can talk whenever you want.

Him: Do you mind if it's later, I have to finish up some work now.

Me: Anytime.

Him: <3 

Him: \[20 minutes later\] Do you know how much I miss our old apartment life? Like I feel so lost and so like, wtf happened.

**Me: I don't know. I thought you hated it there.**

Him: Ok. One thing is not being in love with the apartment for certain reasons and another is missing our life and how we used to live together. I feel sad and I'm telling you how I miss you and us. it's weird how you, in a way, are like throwing it back my way with that comment. Idk it feels like you are not there for me.

My kids have a banquet on Sunday and it is Harry Potter themed. He found a cool way to make robes and I was going to knit or crotchet a scarf in Gryffindor colors (as it is their favorite house). The problem is the scarfs weren't coming out the way I wanted them to and were taking a lot of time. So I had the thought of crocheting a tie in the same colors. I figured it was more practical as it would be hot with a scarf on and the students in the movies all wear ties as part of the uniform. I whipped one up quickly and it looks good. I was finishing it up and my husband came downstairs and was really rude.

He says it is horrible because it isn't what we discussed. He says that we agreed on the scarfs and if I had just done them the way he thought I should do them I would he done (he doesn't get why it wasn't working). I know he is stressed out from work and so I ask him what is really bothering him. He tells me I changed the plan without bothering to tell him. I explain that I was just trying something to see if it would work. He claims that it is awful because no one wears a knit tie and it would look like bad cos play. Our kids are 6 ans 4. This isn't some fancy thing. I really think it would look cute. I still do. We usually have great communication, but he is being a complete prick. I am also not in the best headspace.

1,"AITA for Changing my Mind about Selling a Camera? | 
So I am selling a camera on eBay. At first, I listed with a starting bid at 325 dollars with a ""buy it now"" option at 465 dollars. If you’re not familiar with eBay, the ""buy it now"" option enables you to instantaneously buy the item for the price, without having to wait for the auction to end.

There were some bids that went to 340. One of the bidders messages me saying that ""I know I'm breaking the rules, but can you sell it to me for 400 now? I need to use it soon."" I said that the best I could do was 450, and he says he's fine with it.

I took some more time to think about the offer. I did some research, and I saw that the model generally sells at more than 500 dollars. I realized that because of the way it was listed, the camera will not sell for more than 465, despite the fact that I initially expected a possibility of selling it for more than 465 dollars, which meant that I was going to lose out on the sale. So, I ended the auction and restarted it, setting the initial bid at 450 dollars without a ""buy it now"" option.

This is what I sent him, word by word: ""Sorry, after some research I decided to list it at a higher price. You can still bid and I'll send you a vintage lens and an adaptor as an apology if you win, but if not I wish you good luck with other sellers. If you need to use it urgently, I recommend you rent one.""

Here is what he sent. There seems to be a typo there, but I'm not sure what it is meant to be:""Nah that’s just messed up man. I’m not gonna but someone that makes an excuse to resist the item to make some more money. No thanks""

Around 2-3 times a week, this middle aged haggard guy comes in and buys multiple bottles of whiskey/beer, etc. If that weren't an indication he is an alcoholic, his hands are always shaking when he uses his credit card.

I am the only one who works there during a lot of shifts. And I am tired of letting him give in to his addiction. So yesterday he came in again and I told him I refuse to sell to him. He got annoyed and was arguing with me. There was a small line behind him that he was holding up.

I told him ""you're a drunk, get the fuck out before I call the police."" He pleaded with me that he needs the liquor to hold off his withdrawals. Now I've known heroin addicts who got clean and I realize suffering through withdrawals is uncomfortable, but it's needed.

So I told him ""well sir, sometimes we need to put on our big boy pants and muster through the pain.""

He kept asking me to let him buy the liquor just the one time but I told him he's banned from the store. He called me a child as he walked out and I yelled to him to go get cirrhosis from another store if he wants it that bad. 

My father told me I have no right to ban his customers and they can get whatever they want. But I told him it's a moral wrong to let him keep buying alcohol and I was doing him a massive favor.",False,False
0,"AITA for not picking up a friend from the airport when I said I would? | My best friend who moved away and I haven’t seen in 2 years was planning on flying up to see me for my birthday. I told her I’d pick her up from the airport in Portland, but apparently she decided to fly into Seattle instead (which is almost 4 hours from where I live.) so she can stop and see another one of her friends that live there. I have a newborn and do not feel like driving that far. To top it all off, I work mon-fri til 7pm and am off weekends but she somehow planned it that she’ll be at my house on the weekdays, but with her other friend on the weekend when I can actually hang out. 

I don’t mind that she’s going to see other friends, but it’s frustrating that she says she’s here for my birthday but isn’t hanging out with me the only time I’m off. I was a little hurt and being petty asked her if she was planning on renting a car since she’s flying into Seattle (since I’m not going to get her.) She said sure and got really quiet afterwards. The thing is I probably would have tried to make the drive to Seattle if she was spending the whole time with us, but since she’s not prioritizing us with her time, I feel like I shouldn’t go out of my way to prioritize her.

1,"AITA for being angry that my restaurant left me out of their Gofundme for it's staff after I had given my notice but didn't end up leaving? | I worked in a restaurant in Chicago. I had decided that I was going to be moving and starting a new job in California so I gave two weeks notice. The very next day after giving my notice, the entire staff, including me, was laid off because the government mandated we shut down. Within a few days, I decided to put moving on hold until things calm down. I let my boss know that I was going to be staying and wanted to continue working whenever the restaurant reopened. I was told that because my two weeks would have ended long before the restaurant reopens, my termination was already processed however I would still be welcomed back to work once they reopen. I was incredibly relieved because I knew I had a job to come back to when this all ends. Over the next month, the restaurant collected donations through Gofundme for the staff. But even though my last working day was the same as everyone else and I will be returning to work with everyone else, they didn't include me in the distribution of the funds.

The issue is G never sent out save the dates, meaning last week we got the actual wedding invitations for a wedding that is happening in 1 month.  

It will be at her grandmother's Ranch and it seems like a pretty nice wedding. 

here is where the issue started. 

a few months ago me and 3 friends decided to plan a trip to Australia to backpack/sightsee for 2 weeks, the trip starts 2 days before the wedding so we can't go. G knew about the trip as we invited her but I'm geussing she forgot. 
she is mad at all of us for not just cancelling the trip and being at her wedding. 

all of us are not super rich so this would be a huge loss if we cancelled the trip. (so we are not) 

I also want to add that she invited 50 people, I asked. and only 20 can make it as she gave 1 month notice.

1,"AITA for not helping my cousin because of what his family did? | Throwaway because I'm not sure if he's on Reddit or not.

Some background: When I was younger (12 years old) my Aunt (Mum's younger sister) borrowed money from my parents to get my Uncle bailed from jail due to fraud charges. At the time my parents were just about making ends meet and my Mum hesitantly gave her quite a large sum with the expectation of being paid back. But they never did.
My parents struggled after some time but I knew what was happening and I felt powerless to help

A decade later my Uncles brother started stalking my then 24 year old sister. He would follow her every time she went out at night, he would drive 2 hours to come key her car in the middle of the night. He would even call her workplace and try to get her fired. It came down to filing a police report against him for him to stop.

A few weeks ago - we were at a family event hosted by my grandparents and everyone was invited and we grudgingly attended.
They found out that I have my own business and my grandparents asked if I could try to get my cousin to work with me to help him out a little with experience. I told them that he will need to pass an interview. 

Yesterday we had the interview...The anger of his family being a thorn in my parents side got the better of me. I scrutinized his CV, made him sit a test and purposefully failed him and told him that I cannot give him a job.

There’s a kid who lives in my development but not on my same street. However he takes it upon himself to play on the dead end street right next to my house that is on a corner. He throws sticks, tries to break stones and rocks next to my house. I’ve told him to stop many times. I don’t know who his parents are until the 911 incident. 

So yesterday he was up to no good and throwing rocks. I told him to stop coming here and he talked back and said shut up. So I decided to call 911. The police showed up and the kid got scared shitless and started crying and hyperventilating. His dad ended up coming and started calling me a dirtbag for calling the cops on a 8 year old boy. I told the dad to pound sand and said he needs to control the boy better. 

The dad had to tell the police he would make sure the kid wouldn’t come near my home anymore and play. As they were leaving I yelled to the kid “that’s what you get you little punk” and slammed my door.

1,"AITA For ordering some of the most expensive items on the menu that my gf's father was paying for? | My (24M) girlfriend recently got into a good graduate school and her father decided to celebrate by taking his family and me out to celebrate, and when he was inviting me, he specifically said ""come out with us, anything is on me.""

We went to a fairly pricey restaurant, I ordered an item from the menu that was around $60, which was the most expensive out of all the orders. It was a seafood dish that I had never tried before, but when all the food came, I ate about half of it but it was upsetting my stomach. 

My girlfriend noticed and asked if it was alright, I told her I couldn't eat it anymore and I said I will probably order something else. Unfortunately since I already started to eat it, the waiter said we'd still be charged for it. I ordered something else from the menu, slightly cheaper (around $52) but still one of the more expensive items. 

I was a little embarrassed obviously. But after I got my second order, I was able to eat it with no problems.

Eventually we decided to order some wine, the brand everyone agreed to was not one of my favorites. I asked if we could also order another bottle that I liked, it was equally expensive. The father looked at me and laughed and said ""ok as long as you are paying for it,"" now I thought he was joking so I didn't think anything of it. 

After the waiter brought out both bottles of wine, and we drank some and talked. Since I wasn't on the hook for paying, I wanted to splurge and ordered some dessert (I was the only one).

After finishing, the check came and as we were all getting up, the father came to me and told me I owed him for the extra bottle of wine. I was surprised and told him I thought he was only joking, he said he wasn't. I told him ""you said at the beginning everything was on you, now you're suddenly making me pay?"" 

He argued with me and said the whole extra bottle and dinner was unnecessary. He and his wife have well paying jobs so I said to him ""well what difference does it make? You can obviously afford it"" 

Eventually he got frustrated and just dropped it. My girlfriend later argued with me said I should have ordered less/cheaper items. I reiterated if money was an issue, the father should have told me to order under a certain threshold, but because I ordered things that happened to be expensive, I am expected to pay?

0,"WIBTA to end a lifelong friendship because I found out they stole something from me years ago? | Where do I begin? In 1980 my buddy (I'll call Eddy) and I did a road trip to Minneapolis to see the proto-Goth band ""Bauhaus"" play at a club during their first U.S. tour.  I was a film major in college at the time, so snuck my movie camera into the club and shot some amazing footage of the band. This was before they got really popular, so it was very intimate. Great shots of Peter Murphy who was only about 10 feet from me. Anyway, I get the film developed and placed the labeled reels on a bookshelf in my dorm room.  At the end of my senior year, I box up all my stuff and move back home, thinking I had everything. Only a few months later do I start going through my college film projects when I realize the reels from the Bauhaus concert are missing. WHAT-THE-FUCK??? I go through all of my stuff thinking maybe I put them in the wrong box, or left a box behind (if I discovered other stuff was missing). Nope. Everything is accounted for except for these specific film reels. I'm at a total loss about what could have happened to them.  


Fast forward 35 years and I'm drinking with Eddy having a great old time, laughing and reminiscing about old times when I bring up the Bauhaus concert we went to. I said something like, ""I can't believe I lost the film I shot of them. Could you imagine how cool it would be to still have that?"" And - keep in mind we've been doing Boilermakers for the past hour and pretty loose - Eddy says, ""Oh, I think I swiped that from your dorm room just before you graduated."" My immediate retort was, ""You ASSHOLE!"" ...followed by laughing it off because at the moment we were having a lot of fun.  


The next day, having sobered up, I remember Eddy's confession. I'm now genuinely pissed. I can forgive a lot of stuff, but stealing from me seems like a fundamental betrayal of trust. Furthermore, it's not like he had the film and could return it to me, because in the course of his confession he mentions he has no idea what became of the film reels.   


Would I be an asshole to cut ties with him? I know I could forgive him, but now I'm thinking, what other stuff of mine ended up in his pockets without my notice? I don't want to be petty, but I also can't be friends with someone I no longer trust.",False,False
1,"AITA for refusing to help my mom with bills when she earns triple my pay? | Hey.

So, a bit of context. My mom[47] has been a single mother almost her whole life. I[20] and my brother[30] grew up with just one parent and life has always been tough for us. My brother moved out when he was 23 and I am planning it as well, ASAP.

My mother earns triple the pay I do at the moment, but she has a lot of bills to pay (including credit cards, after-payments [small and big], car lease, house loan, small-loan et cetera). She is very good at planning her money, but terrible at saving money. She pays her bills and almost runs out of money every time. However, she often spends money on useless things. If she has free money, she *will* find a way to spend it. 

I go to university, work 4 days a week and earn three times less (even a bit more) money than she does. She knows I have money (because I am the kind of person to save up) and pressures me into helping her because she is often out of money. I would, however, like to save up and need to keep money in order to visit my girlfriend, save up for moving out, pay my own phone bill, buy myself new clothes etc.

0,"AITA for making a complaint that got my neighbors evicted? | I'm not normally a snitch, but I live in a duplex and there was a situation with our downstairs neighbors that got to a breaking point. My partner and I notified our landlord of a continuing situation and this morning we found out the neighbor had been evicted.

The new neighbor, we'll call Janet, moved in sometime in October. Shortly after moving in, she had a housewarming party. It went late, it was loud, and we began smelling cigarette smoke coming up through the floor. Smoking inside and on the property is a violation of the lease. My partner and I went down around 1 AM (this was a weekday and we both had to work the next day) and knocked on the door. She answered and we asked if they could keep the noise down and to stop smoking inside. She apologized, the noise level went down, and the indoor smoking stopped. That weekend our landlord asked if there were any problems with the new neighbor. We mentioned the cigarettes because our kitchen still smelled like cigarettes (we're non-smokers). He apologized and told us he would warn the neighbor. Since that warning, there was no more smoke, just the occasional ""normal neighbor noise"" i.e. TV noise, guests talking a little loud - nothing we couldn't ignore/drown out.

Flash forward to around Christmas. A woman with 2 children under the age of 3 (I'm guessing) shows up and begins moving in (full on with a bed, clothes, furniture, etc) with Janet. This is also in violation of the lease. We tried to be mindful of the neighbor's friend because we overheard (because this new woman always talked very loud) that she was getting away from the father of the children and trying to get into a stable living situation for the kids so that CPS wouldn't take her kids away.

This is where it got disturbing for me and my partner. The floors in our duplex are thin, and we weren't intentionally eavesdropping, but from the moment we woke up (and sometimes the noise would wake us up) to when we would go to bed, Janet (who was on the lease) and this new woman with the kids (who was not on the lease) would be constantly screaming at each other. Not only that, the mother of the children would scream at her children when they would cry (which was often) and tell them that she would ""kick their f\*cking asses"" ""beat the sh\*t out of them"" and my partner was home once and heard the mother scream that she would ""f\*cking kill"" her child if it didn't stop crying.

We informed our landlord of these threats to the kids and they were both evicted. I heard the woman on the phone outside call my partner and I assholes who complained because we didn't like having babies living under us, but that was not the issue at all. I also heard her say that she's scared they'll end up on the streets.

Are my partner and I the assholes for telling our landlord about this situation?",False,False
1,"AITA for refusing to pay for hit-and-run damage to my friend’s car? | So my friend Ben decided to stay in town for New Year’s this year and let me borrow his car so I could visit my parents on Tuesday night (my car is currently in the shop for some engine issues). I parked the car on the street in front of my parents’ house around 8 p.m. and went inside. At some point during the night, somebody hit the car and drove away, because when I went outside for a run the next morning, I saw that part of the rear bumper was damaged and there were white scrape marks along the left side. There was no note. My parents and I knocked on a few of the neighbors’ doors to see if anybody had witnessed the hit and run and could give us some more details about the other vehicle, but unfortunately nobody said they had heard or seen anything. 

I contacted Ben right away and let him know what had happened so he could file a claim with his insurance. We took the car in to a body shop this morning, and they gave us a quote of a little over $1,200 to repair everything. Ben’s insurance should cover the majority of it, but there is still a $500 deductible that he has to pay out of pocket.

So here’s the problem: Ben thinks that I should be the one to pay the deductible because I was the last person to drive the car and parked it in the spot where it got hit. I said there’s no way I’m going to pay $500 for damage caused by a hit-and-run. If I had caused an at-fault accident, I would absolutely pay up, no question. But the car was parked. I was not driving it. I understand that having to pay the deductible sucks, but it’s his car, and I think it’s his responsibility to cover the cost.

Well this older couple came in and sat at the very next table. So there’s only us in this restaurant and they chose to sit next to me. 

Well my dad called and my food hadn’t come yet so I’m tired, in pain, and starving. My dad was mad that I chose to go eat alone and not invite him so I slightly raise my voice and I’m like “you eat all the time without me and I’m just starving and upset and my foods coming so I gotta go”

We’re trying to have a conversation but you are interrupting us” and I’m just sitting here shocked like bruh.

My best friend is the first person we told. She didn’t seem excited so I figured it was shock and she’d come around. She was there for me some during the pregnancy- I had a scare one day and she came over to sit. 

She’s short on money so husband and I planned on paying her to watch our dogs this week. She watches them fairly often and sometimes just asks to because she misses them. She was excited to keep them. 

And then my water broke and all she said back was “I’m sick”. Even though we had plans the next day and had been texting all day. Out of the blue sick. I thanked her for telling me and not getting baby sick and really believed her at first. But almost a week later I’ve asked her how she’s doing twice and she hasn’t asked me how I am at all. 

During the pregnancy it was something we barely talked about because I could tell she had little interest. We still hung out at least once a week. Little interest was fine with me during it because I felt like she wasn’t just treating me like an incubator like so many tend to do.

I'm 26F and currently living with my mom for a month between apartments. Normally we get along fine and she was super excited to have me stay here during the holidays. However, she's extremely uptight whereas I'm super easy going. But it has been fine so far.

We've been talking about getting a Christmas tree today some time after my lunch plans, but never chose a time. I went to lunch then got home and she was at the grocery store. I had a headache, so I went to lie down. When my mom got home she immediately said ""let's go get a christmas tree"" and I told her I was lying down. Immediately, she got upset, yelled FINE, I'LL JUST DO IT MYSELF, and left to go get a tree alone--which is something that I consider to be a special thing you do with family.

So, she got back and asked me to help her decorate it. However, at this point, she couldn't wait \~1 hour for me to be ready to go pick out the tree and I feel like her inexplicable need to get the christmas tree RIGHT THIS SECOND when we hadn't planned anything (and trees would still be there an hour later) means that her neuroses are more important than doing christmas things with her daughter.

We did get a discount, but we also had to deal with boxing up their stuff for them and having to clean the entire house (things they would have had to do themselves if it was sold to a stranger).

1,"AITA for ""forcing"" my girlfriend's son to be vegan? | My girlfriend (Lana) and I have always lived apart and weren't planning on changing that fact for a long time, but recently Lana ran into some financial troubles and has had some problems paying rent. With that in mind, I offered Lana rent free accommodation at my own house (which I own). The only conditions were that she tidy up after herself and keep a strict vegan pantry, given I don't eat animal products and find them disgusting. The same rules were to go for her son, Mike (17). I should mention on top of providing free rent, I'm also paying for all the food in the house. Lana agreed to this and moved in a few weeks ago.

Since then Mike has been causing nothing but trouble. He makes loud, rude comments about my way of life, complains about the food that I paid for out of my own pocket to provide for them, and keeps on trying to antagonize me. Things came to a head yesterday when Mike arrived at my house with a few leftover meat pizzas he apparently had gotten from his friends. Now, I have no problem with what Mike or Lana eat outside of the house, but given this is my own home I won't have meat inside of it. After I told him this he threw what I can only call a tantrum, tossed the pizza through my house, and stormed off after calling me a ""vegan bitch"". Now he's staying at a friends and threatening to go live with his Dad instead.

Lana is upset and tells me he is only being a teenager and I need to lighten up on my rules. I think that given this is my house they're staying in for free, he should show a little more gratitude and not throw things in my house like a toddler, and see no problem with him going to his fathers if he has such a problem with me. I shared what had happened with a few friends and while most agree with me he's ungrateful, a few of them said I was being a dick and he's Lana's son and I should try to make more of an effort with him.

But first I should perhaps give some context so when I was 14 my parents divorced and I was heartbroken , I cried I suffered , but my parents never tried to enforce a custody order /anything of the sort , my mother moved out to Canada and I could be with her or my dad whenever I pleased  (Albeit I had to say in advance that I’d like to go to my mother or stay with my father ) that was quite reasonable I guess I mostly wanted to remain impartial in this . Then a few months after the divorce I met my stepmother she was one of the most caring and  nicest people I’ve ever met same for her 2 daughters (age 6 and 8 then) we got along really well and after a while she started treating me as if I was one of her own children , she really loved me and she probably still does , I loved her and her kids too and everything was generally great until a few days ago when I found who my “mommy” really was she was my fathers mistress , this woman lied to me and I loved her , something in me snapped and I told my father to either get rid of her and my “sisters”within the next 2 days or I’ll move out to my mother in Canada and he or his “wife” will never see me again . And whilst he hasn’t given me a concrete response yet it seems like hell just divorce her and I’ll never have to see her again . I personally do feel rather horrible as I saw her crying her eyes out , she literally came into my room and asked me if I hate her this much and tried telling me that she loves me and other such things. Again I’m sorry if I broke any rules (based on what I’ve read I haven’t ) , please feel free to correct me as I generally am new to reddit and just wanted to ask for judgement whether I should feel horrible or not so AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for telling a volleyball player the majority of people only come to games to ogle the players? | 16M, and there's a girl I know, let's call her Carmen \[16F\]. She's a hella salty, sarcastic person and tends to snark at everyone. General douchebag-type energy. I wouldn't call myself a mean person in general, but if someone insults me, I'll respond.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I play golf pretty competitively, and also soccer and lax for my school, and I'd say I match the stereotype for golf/soccer/lax players in my area- white, preppy, rich-ish, etc. Carmen (who is white and rich herself lol) makes fun of me for this a lot. At first I just really ignored it, but as time went by it got really really annoying. So today, when she insulted me, I just asked if she played any sports. She said volleyball (I knew she did, just asked to make sure), and I responded by saying, 'oh, that sport that people only go to watch girls shake their asses?'

&#x200B;

This pissed her off a lot, and she said it was 'offensive' and 'gross' of me to say that. I don't see anything wrong with what I did, since a) she shouldn't dish it if she can't take it, and b) what I said is mostly true- most guys who come to girls volleyball games at my school do so just to stare at the girls.

1,"AITA for not fixing my boyfriends watch that I can't afford to fix and breaking his trust | To start I'm in college and 22F, by boyfriend never went to college he just turned 21M now. His family has a lot of money while mine didn't so he doesn't really have to go to college but I do because my family is middle class and can't afford to give me an allowance my whole life. Money is tight for me is what I'm trying to say.

Two weeks ago my boyfriend was going to go out of the country with some friends and needed me to see if his passport was in the safe while he was out doing something so he told me the code and I looked. 

He has an expensive watch collection and he never really lets me take pictures of them or look at them so while I was looking for the passport I took out one of the watches, (the most expensive one, lucky me) and I accidentally dropped it on the hard floor in our closet and the glass broke from it hitting wrong. I started crying and I called my sister and asked her what to do and she said to just leave it and tell him later. So I put it back into the box and back into the safe.

He got back from his trip a week ago, a few days went by and he took out the watch and saw that it was broken and said ""What the fuck happened to my watch"". I told him what happened, he was pissed that I touched his stuff without permission etc. told me that the watch was 1 of 30 ever made and said that I would have to pay to get it repaired. He says it's going to cost around $2,500 at least and ""maybe a little bit more"".

I can't afford that at all and he knows that. $2,500 is nothing to him. I told him there's no way that I can afford it. He started going on saying that pieces of the crystal can get inside the movement and ruin the watch and that I'll be lucky if it's just the crystal that's broken. I started crying and he just left, took his watch box and watch and said ""goodbye"". Now he isn't answering my FaceTimes and he's been gone for 3 days now and hasn't came back for anything or tried to talk to me.

AITA for this? My sister doesn't think so because he can afford to fix it on his own and I was just looking, not trying to show it to someone else that he doesn't know. But I really feel like I might be but I can't really help it because I can't afford to do this as much as I want to fix it for him.",False,False
1,"AITA For leaving work on time? | So I work in the restaurant industry as a baker for a major franchise at a very busy location.

I informed my manager in the morning that I would have to leave on time she assured me it would be fine. All is good or so I thought for as I go to punch out the other manager looks at me and says ""so is everything ready to go?""

My 14yo is into media, sports and techs whereas my 7yo is way more interested in toys, which is normal. My 14yo has a ton of toys that he hasn't played with in years that have been sitting in the toy closest. Instead of buying brand new toys for my 7yo, I started to give him the ones my 14yo stopped playing with. My 14yo had a fit over it. I asked him what the big deal was by giving his brother a damn Lego set that my 14yo hasn't used in five years and will never use again? It's like giving my 7yo one of his old shirts.

0,"AITA for not sharing my passwords and phone messages with my SO | Was married, then divorced due to a deteriorating relationship.  I thought it was me and worked on myself in that time.  6 years after the divorce, we actually got back together (one year ago now) and have been living together again for about 9 months.  Recently, my friend (M32) moved in because his apartment was sold and he wasn't under a yearly lease so they had him move out and I offered a place to stay.  He's been living with us for about 3 weeks.  He's single and uses tinder and such to try and meet people, but he came across my SO the other day.  He forwarded it to me and I confronted her about it.  She said she had trust issues and was looking to see if I was on it.  The admitted to making a Facebook dating thing and a POF account too, but was happy to see I wasn't on there.  When I questioned how this was a problem if she didn't have trust in me, she said I should let her have my passwords and phone access to help her build that trust.  I said no, I have a right to my privacy.  (I mainly like my privacy because I sometimes talk to my sister or other family about troubles at home when I feel like I can't communicate with her). While that's not cheating, it isn't conversations that might go over real smooth if she were to have free access to them.

She claims most married couple share that kind of stuff with each other, and that me not giving her access is a trust issue for her.

1,"AITA for moving my neighbour's illegal dumped furniture to block their entire apartment blocks driveway? | I live on a street where illegal dumping of furniture happens quite frequently. It blocks the footpath and, if it's things like couches or mattresses, it stinks when it rains or, if its something like old clothes, bits of it blow all over the street. Not to mention it just makes the neighbourhood look shitty. I used to just call up the city council who would come and collect it, but I thought this would only encourage the problem - people have their stuff taken away for free without consequence.

The city cannot issue fines either as they cannot identify which unit is responsible for each dump.

So, lately, at night I've been moving it in from where it blocks the foot path to cover their driveway. The issue is, of course, it blocks everyone in the apartment block's driveway, not just the offender. But I figured by doing this it would cause their neighbours to discourage the dumpers.

1,"AITA for bailing out of starting a business with someone who rejected me as a dating partner? | I, single dad in my 30s (this will be important later on), have known the girl, let's just call her M, for several years. We work in the same industry. She is well versed in what she does, I am well versed in what I do. We would've complimented each other very well professionally, which is why we have been seriously planning to start a business together. 

We also got along great on a personal level, which is where I (in hindsight this was probably stupid) took a liking on her. I hinted at it a few times, she never seemed to get it (in hindsight, she was just trying to avoid having that conversation at any cost), until one day I just asked her out, and then awkward silence followed, and then a long monologue followed of her explaining to me that she really liked me, but also that she couldn't stand kids, would never date a parent and pitied everyone with a ""dysfunctional family"", aka a couple that had kids and split up. She probably repeated it two or three times that she didn't have issues with my particular child, and that it was her general dislike of children. 

It's been awkward with her for several weeks after. Again my fault for even trying to start something romantic, I was just being honest with her about the fact that I liked her. But that conversation turned around the whole perception I had of her. I guess I now think she's a ""worse"" person for disliking children this much. 

One of her friends hit me up and asked me how a subject that she's apparently ""been open about her whole adult life"" didnt register with me. Well for some reason it didnt. I knew she didn't have kids. I did not know she actively disliked them. I just couldn't picture myself working with her anymore. No money went into starting that business, plenty of time sure did because we were already looking for a space to rent. 

Fast forward half a year, we no longer talk, I'm doing fine, she's doing fine, but apparently every time she runs into a mutual friend, she won't stop talking about how much of an immature asshole and shitty person I am for ruining something we both been working towards for so long.

1,"AITA for making my birthday dinner reservations for 4:30pm? | So I guess my family and I have differing ideas about what is a good time to eat dinner. They think I’m being selfish here. I think it’s my birthday and I want to follow my typical schedule. 

My 32nd birthday is on Monday and I had made dinner reservations at a nice steakhouse for my family and I at 4:30 on Friday. My husband and I typically eat dinner at 4:30 or 5, or earlier if we’re hungry. 

My parents think eating steak or just dinner in general at 4:30 is a bad idea and bad for digestion. My dad says it’s bad for his stomach to eat dinner so early. But he would say the same thing if I made dinner reservations for like 9 (which is when I used to have my birthday dinners when I was in my 20s) 

My younger sister says she cannot eat dinner at that time as it’s way too early for her. She works in an office 9-5 and she says she absolutely cannot and will not ask to leave early for my dinner. She says even if I made it Saturday though, she would come and have a drink with me but she’s not eating dinner so early because she doesn’t have to and she doesn’t want to. She says a slow dinner is how she likes to relax at the end of the day and 4:30 is mid day. She claims she already compromising by agreeing to go to a steakhouse as she’s vegan.  

My brother is a bit more chill about it; he says I can have what I want but even he says he’ll probably get an appetizer if he gets anything and not a full dinner. 

My parents and sister say they’ll come celebrate with me but they won’t eat. I feel they are implying I’m selfish for not considering everyone elses’ “Needs” (wants) on my birthday and if I want to enjoy a full dinner with them and not have them show up and not eat, I should make my reservation for a typical dinner time. I think they’re selfish for not just rearranging their eating schedule for ONE day. It’s one day of their lives and I don’t understand. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for telling my fiance that I can't love his kid as much as I love the one we're expecting? | My fiance and I are expecting a kid and even though he or she isn't born yet, I love him or her so much already. I can't even explain the feeling. It's the most intense love ever. 

I've been with my fiance for a while, however, and he has a child from a previous relationship. While she is really sweet and while we have a good connection, I'm worried about not being able to love her as much when our kid is born. 

Like don't get me wrong, I love being able to spend time with her and being able to be a part of her life. Being able to do kid things with her helped me get through the stress of school and career planning. She's always supported me in her own ways and tells me all the time that she loves me. 

I adored her when I first entered her life because she is such a sweet, loving, smart kid. However, now I'm realizing that the trope of ""you'll never love anyone as much as your own kid"" is true. I'm starting to notice her neediness and stubbornness more, just how much work she is and how much I do for free, essentially, since I'm her only mother figure and her bio mom has chosen to neglect her.

I brought this up in a conversation with my fiance, and he seemed a bit surprised and sad, but not totally upset. However, he's now kind of giving me the silent treatment and is kind of keeping me away from his daughter more, albeit subtly. I mean, I was just being honest with him since he's the most important person in my life and wanted advice on how to cope with these feelings. AITA for admitting this?",False,False

1,"WIBTA for kicking out my currently divorcing sister? | My sister is in the middle of getting divorced, and it's been messy and long and not mutual. Basically, it sucks for her majorly. Due to some of her own behaviors, and his better lawyers, it's looking like she'll get very little from the divorce and was ordered separate and needed a place to live. She has a very young daughter and I suspect might be pregnant (with her husband's kid, but I think she might want to get an abortion so I've not brought it up). I own a house with more than enough space, so I was happy to open my house to her. I told her to stay as long as she needed and I'll help with my niece no problem. 

It's been a few months now, and it was going well, but recently I just feel like I want my own space back. She's rarely underfoot and they keep to their own area of the house, and she cleans up after herself, cooks for me occasionally, so no problems there. But I just am a little tired of living with a child and my sister and I just want to get on with my normal life. She is also still in contact with her husband, so every once and a while I have to listen to her argue with him which makes me feel anxious in my own home. She also works from home very often so sometimes I just feel like I can't do what I want to do because I know she's there. And she has asked me to look after my niece while she does things a few times, but I just don't know how to be around kids that young even though I do love my niece. 

I also started dating very recently, and I think it'll get serious. The person I'm dating expressed some discomfort in coming over because of the sort of ready-made-family situation, and I don't want to give the wrong idea about anything and I'd be open to a living together situation soon. 

I talked to my mom about it, and she said I would definitely be an asshole since my sister is a model tenant, and I was thinking of renting out one of my rooms anyway. My parents live in a small one bedroom house or they would have taken her in. So would I be an asshole?

1,"AITA for subconsciously discriminating against black gamers on Xbox? | So today I had a moment where I caught myself and I'm self reflecting about this.

0,"AITA for ""qualifying"" my apologies? | Maybe ""qualifying"" isn't the best word, more like specifically saying what I am apologizing for.

Either way, I don't have a problem apologizing when I've done something wrong, but a blanket ""I'm sorry"" doesn't really feel like it does anything to address what went wrong and how to avoid it in the future -- especially when it's more nuanced than ""i was wrong and you were right.""

For example, my girlfriend and I started arguing about something trivial the other day. Not to go into too much detail, she ended up accusing me of doing something behind her back that i know she asked me not to do. That wasn't the case, things started getting heated, and i raised my voice, essentially turning it into a full blown fight.

We worked it out later (ended up being mostly a miscommunication) and I said that I was ""sorry for escalating the situation."" I stand by what I said, but I fully acknowledge that I made the argument into a bigger deal than it needed to be and I was genuinely sorry for it.

I feel like that makes sense, but my girlfriend gets a little upset by it sometimes because she feels like I'm being insincere (or pointed) when I qualify apologies like that.

This isn't an ongoing argument or anything, and she and I truly have a great relationship. I guess I'm just looking for a reality check here: Am i being an asshole by doing this, or does this sound more like a ""no assholes"" situation and we just need to communicate more effectively?

1,"AITA for not wanting my sister to be in my bridal shower because she’ll be wearing an arm sling | Hi everyone. Let me provide some details to this so I can get a genuine response to my actions. My sister is 20, 4 years younger than me, and has been playing sports her whole life. Just over three years ago, she discovered she has a torn ligament in her elbow that would require surgery to repair. 

Obviously, with any elbow surgery, this meant she would be in a splint for a while. My entire family, including myself, tried to convince her at the time of her injury to get the surgery, however, she refused and continued to play spots such as softball and volleyball which ultimately made the injury worse. 

Around 14 months ago, I got engaged to my boyfriend of 5 years. Almost immediately upon me asking my sister to be my maid of honor, she jumped into action on finally getting her elbow surgery. Calling doctors, scheduling appointments, etc etc. My family and I were obviously glad that she was finally opting for the surgery considering how much worse things had gotten for her within the last year. 

Thinking she would schedule her surgery far enough away from the wedding so that she wouldn’t be in a sling anymore, I thought nothing of it. However, as soon as my fiancé and I settled on a date for our wedding, my sister scheduled her elbow surgery for exactly a week before. I’m getting married in 3 weeks. 

Obviously, I want my sister to be pain free and finally get her surgery. But, like any human being, there is a selfish side of me. I don’t want her to be the maid of honor in my wedding because she’ll be wearing a sling in all of the photos and videos from the wedding. 

Now, most of my family thinks that I’m a horrible person for even considering not letting my sister be part of the wedding party. I feel as though she could’ve waited after the wedding to get the surgery, considering she’s waited 3 years already, or had enough time to get the surgery in advance of the wedding. 

So reddit, am I the asshole for wanting to kick my sister out of my bridal party because she’ll be wearing a sling at my wedding? I appreciate any feedback, good or bad.",False,False
0,"AITA for holding firm to ""my car, my rules"" with regards to my husband smoking? | My husband and I have been together 7 years. He smoked before we met but quit. Since then, he has picked it back up and quit a dozen times. He's done Chantix before and did great with it but started smoking again when school became really stressful (he's a student currently).

Smoking is a deal breaker item for me and he's known that since we were dating. Aside from the obvious health risks, it smells just utterly abhorrent to me. It's not just his breath - it gets in his clothes, his hair, his fingertips, etc. All I can smell is cigarettes. It also costs a fuck ton of money as he's usually a pack-a-day smoker.

In a few days, we are leaving on a cross-country trip and are driving my brand-new car since its nicer and has AWD (we will be in snowy places), and his car does not. I told him MONTHS ago that he was not allowed to smoke in my car and that I didn't even want him smoking at gas stops because he will still smell like an ashtray when he gets back in and stink up my new car. He agreed to this. I kept prodding him to call the doctor and get back on Chantix as that seemed to work the best. He finally got a new prescription for it a little over a week ago.

Tonight, I asked him how he was doing with it and if he was going to be good for the trip. He indicated that he's not gonna smoke in my car but that he intends to smoke on the trip still, including when we stop for gas or when we visit family who smokes.

At this, I put my foot down and held hard to the ""my car, my rules"" thing. He thinks I am being firm just to be stubborn or mean, but I really mean it. I do NOT want my BRAND NEW CAR to stink like nasty cigarettes. We're gonna be driving every day for a week. He keeps saying it won't stink up the car, but he's gone nose-deaf to how he smells after smoking.

So, Reddit, AITA? I understand it's extremely hard to quit smoking but I feel like I've given him plenty of notice on what was expected of him and am only holding him to it.

I move in in about a week, but until then I'm on the other side of the country.

On Saturday, I sent my mom a listing for a pretty cute puppy and mentioned it will be at an adoption event that day in case she wanted to do a meet and greet. A few hours later she sent me a text that she has adopted the puppy and is bringing her home.

I blew up at her for adopting the dog without so much as a phone call to consult and let me make a decision. She says that she considered the dog to be approved by me since I sent her the listing, and that ""what else was I supposed to do?"" at an adoption event. She hasn't done any vetting of the dog since ""all shelter dogs are the same"" and didn't bother checking if the dog is suitable for our family in terms of health needs or personality or energy levels or anything (shes only had purebred dogs before). She also asked, ""Do you want me to take the dog back?"" But then got upset when I said yes, we'll have to take the dog back if it's a poor fit for us.

My parents got separated more than 15 years ago. He met her maybe 10 years ago. I got hurt every year for the that like my birthday isn't important. 

So this year it went even a step forward into me being hurt.

My mom asked my a thousand of times if I was ok about them being away and I said yes because I knew I could find comfort with my grand parents (and I know that we will celebrate my birthday maybe a little later)

And so it's the 20th birthday of my father's girlfriend's daughter and the way it hurt from him to ask me if I minded if we didn't celebrate my birthday, I just want to skip the party.

0,"WIBTA for sharing the reason for our divorce? | Gavin and I have been together for 10 years. 2 years ago, he began a stressful job with a lot of travel, and he went on a work trip with a married colleague ('Nicole'). When he got back, he confessed to me that he had developed 'strong feelings' for her, and she felt the same. He told me they had decided to keep talking 'as friends’.

They kept talking for a few months. I knew about this, but not the extent. She felt guilty and told her husband about their feelings. He was irate. She and Gavin  (supposedly) cut contact outside of work, though I found out later that they chatted intermittently on an app over the following months--telling each other they love each other, etc.

She and her husband divorced. I stayed with Gavin, hoping we could work through it and concerned about his mental health. He was depressed and all of his family and friends lived far away. I helped him keep up appearances at work (he would have panic attacks and was terrified to resign, worried to let everyone down). I convinced him to talk to a therapist and helped him get the courage to resign.

We also went to a couple's therapist to work through issues and, if it came to that, split amicably. We decided if we divorced, we wouldn't share details or place blame. I wrote a letter of forgiveness to Nicole, saying, among other things, that even if they ended up together, I wouldn't tell other people when their relationship started. I've told my parents and best friend Gavin and I are ""having problems"", but no specifics.

I got a job on the other side of the country and asked him to come with me. At first, he said 'no', then a few weeks later, said he had a sort of 'epiphany' and that he did want to come and work on our relationship. He told Nicole to stop talking to him. I moved first; he would follow a few months later. The long distance thing went well the first couple months. He was relieved to not be at his old job. Then, he started to get depressed again, anxious about being unemployed. He finally got an excellent job a few hours away from where I work, and I looked into flexible scheduling at work so we could live together.

He moved to the city his job is in, and, while visiting, I saw a notification from her. I didn't read it, but asked, and found out they started talking again about a month ago. Now, divorce seems imminent.

When I visit their old company later this year and am asked why we are divorcing, I am considering simply saying ""Nicole"". Obviously, I feel pretty justified. Neither of them work there anymore, so I'm not costing jobs. However, it is in a very tight-knit (gossip-prone) community; she grew up there, and her family lives there. The community adores her. Outside of this situation, she seems genuinely nice.

And, to be honest, I would be doing it to be vindictive. I know she is terrified of the idea of being labeled a homewrecker. Also, I don't believe they have physically cheated, if that makes any difference.

Josie moved back about 8-9 months ago? And they started hanging out every weekend.

Then she started hanging around our house, even though I've told her and my husband I'm not ok with it.

She refers to her child as my childs sibling and as my husbands child, even though that child hasn't seen my husband in years and barely remembers him?

I finally had enough and told him he had to pick, I'm sick and tired of our child coming second to his exs child.

1,"AITA for taking on different personalities to attract girls? | I [19M] would like to begin by saying that frankly, I don't know who I am or my personality. I know it sounds super emo and all that, but it's true. I really don't have a strong self-image or personality and tend to be a chameleon who adapts to whoever I'm talking to. 

This is mostly unconscious, but recently, I've been doing it more deliberately. I'm going to college literally across the country, and that really helped me start over. Part of that was girls. 

Obviously, girls aren't homogeneous. They're not all attracted to the same type of guy (assuming they are attracted to guys). Some like pretty boys, some like strong silent types, some like moody artist types, some like macho athlete types. Etc. So I figured, when I'm attracted to a certain girl, why not act like the type of guy she likes? Usually I'm pretty empathetic about these things, so I can pinpoint what a certain girl wants, and morph myself to it. Some come more naturally than others, but I've put on many different personalities. 

One of my friends, Ryan, considers this disingenuous. I don't, because I think we're all putting on masks socially to begin with, to some extent or another. And also, I don't even know who the real me is, so 'being myself' is that much harder.",False,False

My baby is a bit of an “oops” baby. We weren’t trying to conceive, but we were saving, and planning to have a baby soon-ish. 
My friend recently took me out to lunch, and I was just venting to her without much thought. My pregnancy has been rough, i have a crazy rash, I’m dehydrated all the time, I can’t shit when I want, my feet don’t fit into shoes, just general stuff. She completely blew up on me. She started going off about how I didn’t deserve to be pregnant. And she left me in the restaurant. I had to Uber home. 


To make matters even worse, she went home and posted on Facebook about how it’s always the “undeserving” women that get pregnant fast and easy, then suck at raising their children. She didn’t tag me in it but I knew that she was talking about me. I called her a bitch (which I regret because it was public) and blocked her on social media. Some mutual friends of ours have contacted me and said that *I* was fucked up for taking about my pregnancy, and told me to apologize to her, I’m at a loss here. Did I do something wrong?

0,"AITA for telling my mom it’s dishonest and unethical to pass our dog off as a service animal? | So I’m a little angry right now and want to know if I am in the wrong (totally open to criticism). My mom is blind in one eye, since birth. However she has no problems driving and doing other basic daily tasks. Recently, my parents came to visit me in another state and didn’t want to leave our Bernese Mountain Dog at home. They are very attatched to our dog and treat her basically as another human in the family. 

Here is where my question arises. My mom went to our PCP and got a meaningless note saying that my mom needs a service animal. They went out and bought a fake harness that says “service dog” on it and brought her on the airplane and then to places that even for service animals, was inappropriate. I felt so embarrassed because everyone was so respectful of our dog, who while is very well-behaved, is by no means trained to be a service animal. I started making jokes about it and my dad got very angry with me. I responded saying it’s ridiculous and borderline disrespectful to people that actually need mobility animals to get around. My dad is now upset, saying I’m inconsiderate for not respecting my mom’s need.

1,"AITA for quitting my job? | I started teaching English at an academy on Mondays and Wednesdays. They hadn't warned me completely what it was about and I wasn't given a lot of info regarding what I had to do. 

I had 13 3rd graders to teach and follow a schedule that the company sent me a day before the first lesson. I started last Monday, was super stressed and exhausted because I just think it is not my thing to teach elementary, and on Tuesday I thought I'd give it one more try to see if it was just my first day. I went in Wednesday and it was hell. Kids were yelling, running around, trying to jump out the fucking window and so on. I decided I am definitely not a good teacher and would rather not waste their time any more and let a better teacher come. 

I called Wednesday and told them I quit, and they had till the next Monday to find someone else, which they didn't, and I didn't want to go again just to cover for them because it really was hell. So 13 kids had no teacher, but they had enough time to find one, right?...

1,"AITA for not letting a customer leave because he was off by one penny | So this happened about a month ago. I work at a restaurant that has a convenience store in the front of the building where we sell ice cream, merchandise, candy, etc., and I was manning it that day. A burly man walks in with an open cup and is spilling water droplets on the floor as he walks in. I greet him and he walks over, hands me change and says ""For a refill"" (we do cheap refills for those who bring in our large cups or yetis or the like). I say ok sure and start counting while he goes and fills his cup. The total price of a refill is 81¢ after sales tax and he only gave 80¢. 

I politely ask him for the last penny and he looks at me like I insulted his mother and says ""Uh, no. You're not getting that penny."" I reply with ""Well sir I need that last penny or I can't let you leave."" He starts going on about how he's a regular here and is close with some of the employees who have been here longer than I have. I've never seen this guy before in my life so why should I believe him at all? Not to mention the fact that he walked in like he owned the place. Finally he says ""Is (employee) here? I'll get you your damn penny.""

 As he walks towards the actual restaurant, employee is walking towards the front. I hear them talking until I hear employee yell out ""THATONETUBAMAN! What are you doing?!"" And employee walks over and starts to scold me, saying ""You never should have been trained for store."" and ""He's a regular here, I know him."" I told employee ""I've never seen that man in my life."" To which employee responds ""Just because you've never seen him doesn't mean he isn't a regular."" So apparently I'm not only supposed to believe every word each customer says but I'm also supposed to be omniscient while also not letting people steal stuff from the restaurant.

1,"AITA for upsetting with my fiance for selling her house and sharing the money with her siblings | Her mother passed away recently and in the will, she clearly states that my fiance alone will get her whole house while her other children only get a small amount of money each. This is because when she was sick about one year ago, only my fiance stayed and took care of her while her other children only visit her once in a while. Now, my fiance's sibling pestered her to sell the house and split it equally for everyone (included my wife) because it's ""the right thing to do"". They said she is going to marry to me and will move to my house soon so it's not like she needs her house anyway. I should also note that they are living in their mom's house (which is now my fiance's house) for free and never moved away. It's a big house with 5 bedrooms. They are all adult, the youngest is currently studying in college.

The thing is my fiance totally agreed with them. She told me her plan to sell the house and I was angry upon hearing her plan. The discussion turned into an argument, harsh words started flying out (mostly from me) and she told me I would never understand the bond between her and her siblings as I am the only child and that I am too cold blood. Well, my plan was for her to move to my house and we would rent out her house and kick all of her siblings out of the house unless they can pay the rent. Yes, I dont want my fiance to take care these freeloaders anymore. They are all adult, they have some money from their mom so they should take care of themselves. We didnt talk for one day.

0,"AITA for using a standard consumer product that my mother fears, after she's allowed me to live with her? | My mom is letting me move back in but she's scared I'm going to burn the house down.

[F25]/[F55]

I've recently had some mental health problems and my mom invited me to move back in so I can have some more support.

So far it's been great. It's different from when I was a teen. I appreciate the things she does more and I contribute more too. And I'm appreciative of her being supportive while I work through things.

The problem is I'm cold. All. The. Time.

My room is on the 3rd floor and despite the vents being open, it's still freezing. I'm currently using 4 blankets and it's still cold. 


I asked my mom to turn up the heat so i wouldn't be so cold and I think she's reluctant to turn up the heat because she sees it as wasteful to heat up a massive house for 2 people. It's not a money thing, my mom is very wealthy (but she also likes cooler temperatures compared to me as well).

I casually mentioned that I use a space heater at my place, and she dismissed the idea because she thinks they can cause fires. She thinks this of all heating appliances (toasters, microwaves, etc) and has been cautious of all heating appliances since a toaster caught fire 15 years ago and burned a good part of the kitchen. She's irrationally afraid. She unplugs them all after each use.


There are no other rooms I can stay in, they're all dedicated to something else.

Regarding **heating blankets**: she refused to buy those when I was younger as well, we weren't allowed to have them. I'd assume the same applies now.


I've tried temporary ways to insulate the room (taped an emergency blanket to the window), I have 4 blankets (1 fuzzy, two medium and one THICK blanket), I try having tea before bed. I've tried closing surrounding vents so the heat is directed to my room. Near the book shelf by the window is 14C and by my bed is 16C. It's been -10C outside, we don't live in a warm environment.

It's just too cold. I don't want to go against my mother's wishes when she's being very nice, but it's so cold that I find myself involuntarily shivering. She refuses to turn the heat up.

I took the temperature in her room and it's somehow 21 C. So it's not like she's living in the same conditions either. 

So last night I drove back to my place, grabbed my space heater, and came back to my moms. I plan on using it only when I'm here, and I'm buying a fire extinguisher later today to keep in my room just in case. I'm open to employing any other fire safety tips that are specific to space heaters, for example, I made sure that nothing flammable is within a 3 for radius. 

That said, I'm going to be treating this as a ""what she doesn't know, don't hurt her"" scenario to keep my room at a reasonable temperature. 


TLDR: I'm living with my mom now but it's too cold and she's afraid of space heaters. I'm using a space heater now against her knowledge to stay warm. Am I an asshole?",False,False
0,"AITA for sitting close to a female friend? | My girlfriend and I have been dating for a year. She’s great but recently has been freaking out about my relationship with a friend.

So my friend is definitely my best friend. She helped me out so much when I was struggling with addiction and had just always been there for me. I helped her some with her depression, although definitely not to the extent she helped me, but I tried.

We’ve been friends for over 10 years, and I feel no romantic attraction towards her. None. I don’t know for sure but I’m fairly certain she feels no attraction for me either.

Yesterday we (my friend and I) were watching a movie at her house, and then my girlfriend was going to come and we(my girlfriend and I) were going to go out for dinner.

I was sitting on the sofa with my friend, and we were right next to each other. It’s only a two seat sofa so there wasn’t really another option. We weren’t hugging or anything, but were were touching just by happenstance, and neither of us felt the need to move. 

We’re close enough that just sitting and chilling is just, nice. There doesn’t have to be a romantic element to it or anything, just nice. My girlfriend came, and when we left she freaked out saying that it’s basically cheating and that I had to stop being close (physically) with her. I mean, I do similar things with male friends, just sitting on the sofa chilling, so I don’t really see the problem.

0,"AITA for giving our kid ""boring"" lunches for school? | Our daughter in grade 1 has got us complaints from her teacher and the school administration about her lunches. We tend to give her healthier stuff, stuff we eat at home anyways but try to make it more ""snack focused"" if that makes sense. A typical lunch might be a few slices from a baguette or some crackers, some cold cuts (prosciutto, salami, etc), olives, sundried tomatoes, etc. Or sometimes we'll give her things like rice pudding, sausage, once we even gave her some steak to bring to school. I'm just listing things we've got complaints over.

The school argues we're being ""abusive"" by giving her foods the other kids won't like, thus eliminating a ""sharing environment"". She hasn't been teased for her lunches and by her own admission likes what we give her. It's the teacher who thinks it's age inappropriate. I personally argue that what we normally give her is little different from a lunchable, what they suggested we give her. Once we gave her some anchovy fillets for crackers, etc and they confiscated her lunch, which prompted a big argument between us and the school.

1,"AITA for holding a grudge against one of my old middle school teachers? | Earlier today I went hiking and while on the trail, I saw ahead of me coming the opposite direction was my 8th grade history teacher. I really didn't want to talk to her, so I just jumped off the trail and hid behind a tree and hoped that she hadn't noticed me.

For some backstory, this was about 10 years ago near the end of 8th grade when the whole class got assigned a project on hate groups. We got to choose our groups of 3 and we got assigned a specific hate group that we had to do a powerpoint presentation on. The teachers were taking it VERY seriously since the whole point was to bring awareness to the dangers of hate groups in America, but me and my two friends didn't really care all that much. All we wanted was a decent grade.

There was one day when our history teacher brought in a bunch of school laptops for us to use to work on our powerpoint, but me and my two friends just used them to goof off. We went online to watch all of the Jack Links beef jerky Messin' with Sasquatch videos, since those were really popular at the time. We were laughing hysterically, so our teacher inevitably saw that we were up to no good. She went up to us, picked up our laptop, saw what we were watching, and simply said to us ""You're no longer allowed on the school computers."" We weren't allowed to use the laptops, and she had even told the teacher in charge of our computer lab to not let us use those computers. And on top of that, none of us knew how to make an actual powerpoint on our home computers.

We had to make our hate group presentation on a tri fold display board, like it was a cheap science project. We ended up with a poor grade on the assignment and that really fucked up my history grade. I had a failing grade with only weeks left in the year, but thankfully I was able to cram in some studying and miraculously passed our final exams to get a passing grade in the class.

Back to earlier today, my teacher saw me hide behind the tree and told me to come out. She was acting very nice and asking what I'd been up to, but I simply said to her ""You nearly flunked me. I have nothing to say to you."" and I walked off. I know that it may seem like an overreaction on my part, but that's because I believe that SHE overreacted in punishing me and my friends. She went out of her way to make sure that we couldn't complete our project and now she's acting all fake friendly and acting like it never happened. AITA?",False,False

About a year into college, my mom asked if she could use my account as well to get the perks of premium. This caused a bit of an issue because you can only listen to music on one device at a time, and she would always force me to get off whenever she wanted to listen to her (only religious) music. After a few months of this I decided to get an Apple Music account since they were offering the same student discount.

I’m a senior now about to graduate, and it doesn’t make sense for me to pay full price for two music streaming services, especially considering I’m unemployed at the moment. So I cancelled my Apple Music subscription and essentially took back my Spotify account. I changed the password, deleted all of my mom’s music (which was mainly just radio stations she followed and songs she liked) and got rid of everything I didn’t listen to. Before this happened I’ve been telling my mom repeatedly throughout my junior year that when the student pricing for the membership expires I’m gonna delete her off the Spotify account. She would always go ""yeah, okay"" and brush it off like she didn't take me seriously.

When she saw that I removed her from the account, she was livid. She yelled at me, told me I had no right, and that I should have told her in advance. I told her that I had been telling her for the past year, and that it was just music -- it wasn't like it disappeared from the face of the earth.

My boyfriend comes over frequently and is immersed in my home life, so he is familiar with where I get my emotional tendencies from, my mother, and how important it is for my mental heath that I can vent to him.  He sees my families close relationship, and even though they can be a handful, he is always treated like an important part of the family.

As we continue to grow closer in the months that we date, I cannot help but wonder why he does not talk to his parents. It seems quintessential, for me as a child growing up in a large family, to remain in contact with your parents (even though it’s not always what you want to do) as they should love you unconditionally and will always have your back. With that said, when he refuses to talk with them or about them,  it makes me nervous. I want the best for him in the future, and I think having a steady, reliable, parent (or parents) is an important part of life.  I feel like hes only holding himself back from talking about his situation with me. I always remind him how he can tell me anything and that venting is important for mental health.  I’ve asked about his parents before in the past but he always dances around the issue, giving me minor details to settle me in the moment. 

TLDR: I think it’s extremely important to have a good relationship with your parents but my boyfriend does not want to talk about his parents with me.

1,"AITA for not telling one of my brothers that our mom is dying and may not make it to Christmas? | So my mom is 92, in very poor health, and has been for a while.  She just fell and was in the hospital for a couple days and just came home.  She lives with me, my wife and children and we take care of her, but the doctors gave up options for hospice as well.  One of my brothers comes by almost every night to help out and he stays at the house if we go out on the weekends.  

Well my other brother and his family don’t call or come over, and we only ever see them at Christmas.  They haven’t seen her since last Christmas.  They also live about 15 minutes away, so it’s not like they have the excuse of her being far away.  She wasn’t in great shape then, but she’s deteriorated quite a bit since then.  We think that she has a couple days left, and making it to Christmas would be a stretch.  

My wife thinks that I should tell our other brother about mom so he can see spend time with her before she passes.  She thinks it would be cruel to just call him after the fact and let him know that mom passed away. I feel like if they don’t care enough to call to see how she’s doing, they don’t deserve to know now.  My brother that helps out is on my side as well, but my wife thinks we’re terrible people for not letting him know.  So reddit, AITA for not telling our brother about our mom?",False,False
1,"AITA for taking back the money I gave to my wife for a vehicle? | I (30m) have been married to my wife(29f) for 5 years. We both were planning on getting new vehicles this year and she ended up purchasing her car first. She got a Jeep  cherokee for more room and AWD for the snow (no kids). I was planning on getting a BMW M2 (2 door sport cars). We had an agreement that I would give her $4,000 for the down payment for her car since it would be the ""family car"" and I would drive it to work sometimes when it snows. We planned on driving her car most of the time so it seemed like a fair agreement.

We ended up getting in a huge fight about money after she purchased her car but before I bought mine. Our salaries are very similar and we have disagreements about who spends more money. She ended up giving me the $4,000 back due to this fight. At no time did I ask for the money back. I did bring up the fact that I helped pay for her car but she said she didn't want me holding that over her head.

Well I ended up purchasing a Tesla model 3 instead of the BMW. The Tesla is 4 times cheaper to drive than her Jeep(gas vs electric) and it is AWD so I won't need to take her car in the snow. 

Now that I bought my car, she is asking for the $4,000 back... I told her no because I won't be using her car in the winter and we will be driving my car more than hers since it's cheaper to drive. She says she wouldn't have bought her car if she would have known I wasn't going to help with the down payment. I was very confused when she asked for the money back because I have had the money back in my bank account for 2 months and she hasn't said anything about it.

0,"AITA for hiding my snacks in my boot so that my boyfriends daughter doesn’t take all of them? | I live in the uk so using uk terminology here. Boot = trunk, as in boot of a car/ trunk of a car. 

I’m 30 years old, my boyfriend has a daughter who is 11. He is 34. She doesn’t live with her dad full time but her mum doesn’t really care about custody so he has her a LOT of the time and takes her to school, picks her up, has her for nights on end etc. I’m not sure of the intricate details but he will probably have her 3-4 nights of the week. He lives *really* close (10 min drive) from his ex.

I work in the NHS so I buy a lot things like little individual packs of pancakes, crisps, etc, to eat when I’m on break. I store it at my boyfriends house since he wants me over a lot of the time and it’s just easier for me to keep things there. 

I don’t contribute rent/ groceries because I don’t actually live there, I technically live with my sister in her house but yeah, my bits and bobs go to my boyfriends and he’s told me time and time again to feel free to keep my things there. 

Now his daughter will help herself to my snacks and stuff, which I don’t really mind... when I go to Costco I’ll get stuff that she wants and leave it in the fridge but for the past 6 months I’ve noticed she’s eating too much of my things and I can’t really afford to replace it. 

My boyfriend keeps a VERY well stocked house but she always wants to go for the things I buy. There are lots of treats and she gets fed very well balanced meals. 

First I mentioned it to my boyfriend. I said ‘ I know Melissa likes snacks but she keeps eating my work stuff so can we get more of it so we all have some?’ - she started to eat EVEN more once she saw we had multiple bags of things. 

Then I said to my boyfriend ‘can you talk to Melissa and let her know it’s important to leave at least 5 things of each for me’, one for each day of the week. She doesn’t listen. 

I know my boyfriend is strict in telling her to not take too much of things because I’ve heard him, and she says sorry and is genuinely apologetic but each time it’s ‘oh my friends were round’ or ‘ i wanted my little brother to try some’ etc. 

My bf offered to reimburse me which I accepted and he said we will just go to Costco more often but in the UK they are a bit hard to drive to and take a while to make the trip so it’s not really worth it for me with my hours. 

I finally decided to stop leaving things in the house and I’ve started to take 3-4 packs of things out of the main bag, leave it in the house, but also leave the main bag in my boot so when I’m at work I can just nip to my car and get what I need from the boot. It’s been working so far. 

My boyfriend went in to my boot earlier to look for something and he saw the miniature shop of things I had in there. He wasn’t pissed off but just upset and said it’s like I don’t want to share with his daughter. I said it’s not that, I’m just tired of always being left short when I need food.",False,False
1,"AITA for confronting my SO's friend? | Context for later: my SO's friend got into a car accident 2 weeks ago, in which she collided head-on with a tree because she was on her phone. This is important for later. 

&#x200B;

My SO goes to college, and carpools with a friend. Their school is quite far (45 min. on a good day) so they carpool. I sometimes go and pick up my SO if need be, or if we have plans later. The days I go pick her up ends up being me out of the house from around 2 in the afternoon to 7 or 8,

Here's the issue. My SO's friend is usually good when it comes to driving her back home, but the times she doesn't are always due to rather petty things and very short notice. Sometimes she'll leave early and tell my SO at the last second, forcing me to ditch the time I had for schoolwork and fucking up my schedule as well as my SO's.

Then there's today. I've been working on an important project for one of my classes, and my SO texts me that her friend can't take her home because she's doing her mother's hair at noon, when both their classes end around 4. This pissed me off because they had agreed to carpooling way before that, as well as to take my SO to a nail appointment after school, and they wouldn't reasonably be home until about 9. 

I don't get mad at things like this. I try to use reason and see everything from both sides. I told her friend that while I know it's hard to say ""no"" to a parent, it seems to be inconsiderate to change plans with my SO at the last second, making me abandon my schoolwork while jeopardizing my SO's plans in the afternoon. She then told me that I have no right to get mad (which I wasn't), I occasionally pick her up from school anyways, and that her mom comes first. Then I told her that I agree family does come first in many cases, but doing her mom's hair isn't as pressing as going through with taking someone home, especially when that agreement came first."" This caused her to tell me that ""things come up"" which causes plans to change. I told her that her argument would be valid for an actual emergency, but that I thought leaving my SO without a ride and forcing me to put my schoolwork on hold for the entire day was a bit rude (especially when this is far from the first time), and that I felt her mom's hair wasn't the highest priority compared to a deal she made first. 

Then, she told me she wasn't gonna waste her time arguing with me, and that she wasn't gonna sit there and argue when ""I know that to me, I'm right"". I felt I hadn't said anything to warrant that, which pissed me off. I told her ""Logic and reasoning don't matter when your feelings keep you sure in yourself"" and then ""remember next time you're driving that your main priority is not hitting trees and staying on the road, maybe that'll help you keep your priorities straight."" Then she called me a dick, and the conversation ended. She's been doing this to my SO many times, and I felt like today was when I had to speak up. Was ITA, guys? ",False,False

However, if she happens to not shut me down, she rolls her eyes. She always goes on rants about how church is stupid, and every time we get out of church at school, she makes it known how horrible and awful mass was. She also occasionally tells me God isn't real and I should stop believing. I respect her opinion, but she makes it known to me more than anyone else.

1,"AITA for getting my friend a cat? | Throwaway account for obvious reasons.
(I’m in mobile so excuse me for the poor formatting)

A few months ago my friends cat  passed away. She loved this cat, it was her best friend of the whole world. She’s had this thing for about 10-12 years, it went with her when she moved out from her parents place and everything. 

The cat was kinda cute, small fluffy orange thing. I don’t like cats, hate them. They’re nowhere near as loyal as a dog, they claw everything and everyone, littler box in your house?! No thanks. I much prefer dogs but oh well.


Anyway, when the cat died three months ago my friend was devastated, she cried and cried and cried. A week after the cats passing I asked her if she wanted to hang out but she declined saying she didn’t want to go out.  I then asked her the following week but got the same response. A few days go by and I stop by her place, she lets me in and seems fine.

When I walked in I saw a jar on her shelf in her living room next to the tv, taking a closer look it was the cats ashes with its name, age and some weird message on it next to a photo of her and the cat. I was immediately weirded out by that, why would you want a dead animals ashes in your home?

She did get better eventually but it was clear as day that she missed the thing. Well, last month was her 19th birthday and I thought... why not get her a cat? I’m a good friend and it’ll make her happy so she won’t be as mopey. I stoped by the shelter a week before her birth and got a cat that looked something similar to her old one. By the time of her birthday I stopped by her house and her boyfriend was there.  I put it in a box (with holes) and have her the gift. When she opened the box she starts crying. I thought I did something good. Clearly not. She gave the box to her BF and went into her room. It being awkward I left.

Fast forward a few days later I get a message from the BF saying how that wasn’t cool that I got a cat for her. He said something on the lines that she didn’t want a cat at the moment. 

??! What? 

I told him that it’s not like a person died. He didn’t seem to like that answer and told me not to come over for a while. I said I wanted the cat back but he said no, he’s looking after the cat. I paid for the cat, is she doesn’t want it then put it back at the shelter for someone who does want it. He proceeded to call me an asshole and a bitch.

1,"AITA for turning my family against my sister before her wedding? | For some background context, I (22) have a blended family with one bio sister (20), two stepsisters (25 & 28) and a stepbrother (30). My mom & their dad have been together for a majority of our lives (15+ years) so growing up we all became very close, spent all our holidays & vacations together, etc. I truly don’t consider them “step” siblings - although we’re not blood they are my family.

This past fall, my stepsisters got engaged. The younger sister chose me, my little sister, my step-sister, and her closest friends to be her bridesmaids (no MOH). However, my mom was the one to inform me & my bio sis that we wouldn’t be in our other sisters wedding even though she chose TWELVE bridesmaids - including her new boss, a distant cousin, and a college friend she hasn’t seen in years (her bio sis is the MOH). Although I’m closer to the younger sister, I was genuinely hurt that my oldest sister picked twelve bridesmaids but didn’t include us. My other siblings also thought this was a terrible move on her part.

Admittedly, I became a bit passive aggressive whenever the wedding was brought up. For example, my mom said I needed to wear a more formal dress for the wedding because “we’re family so we’re expected to be more dressed up than the rest of the guests” and I responded by saying “if my sister wanted me to be more dressed up than the rest of the guests, she would have made me a bridesmaid.” My mom & step-dad get upset whenever I say anything remotely negative about her wedding, but I think they’re reacting this way cause they were also hurt that my sister didn’t include us.

A few weeks ago, my other sister got married. At the reception, family members asked if I was excited to be in my oldest sister’s wedding a few weeks later, but I awkwardly had to tell them me and my little sister were not asked to be bridesmaids. A lot of them were shocked and genuinely upset that she isn’t including her stepsisters in her wedding party. Our grandmother (my step-dad’s mom) was especially upset since she considers us all family & didn’t understand why she would pick all those other people over us.

I’m not sure if anyone’s actually told my sister how upset they are, but I do know my mom & step-dad are pissed at me. In my mind this was a complete slap in the face and has permanently damaged my relationship with my sister (though we clearly weren’t as close as I thought in the first place) and I have a right to express my frustration and disappointment. However, they think I’m overreacting and need to stop bringing it up, especially since her wedding is in a week and they think I’m going to cause problems for my sister on her special day.

1,"AITA for changing my daughters nappy on the bus | My cars in the shop so ive had to resort to using the bus this last week. The bus journey from where i was to home, plus walking from the bus stop to my house, takes around 70 minutes. My daughter is 2months old.

Earlier today we had just gotten on the bus home when she started to cry in her pram, i gave her her dummy and she settled for a few minutes before spitting it out and screaming, thats when people started to stare. I knew she wasnt hungry as i fed her before we got on the bus so i got her out and started to wind her in case she had abit of wind still, thats when i smelt it, shed shit.

I decided that i obviously couldnt leave her in a dirty nappy and screaming so i asked the woman beside me if shed mind if i changed her nappy and she said not at all so i started to change her on my knee. I got a nappy, wipes and some sudocrem (she has nappy rash) out and started. 

As soon as i opened the nappy her exact words were ‘actually, i didnt realise you meant a pooey nappy so would you mind waiting until your home’ i told her im sorry i shouldve explained i meant a dirty nappy but no i wont wait another hour to change my daughter when shes crying now and already has nappy rash, she asked me why i bothered to ask her if she minded if i was going to do it anyways, i said i was being courteous in case she decided to move first but there is absolutely no way i was waiting to change her nappy. 

The woman started to complain and people behind me did too because “it doesnt look very nice” i told them their shits probably dont look very nice but shes a baby and she cant use a toilet or clean herself so i have to. Thats when more people started to complain, call me rude and inconsiderate. One man told me to get off the bus to change it, he shut up when i asked him if hed enjoy standing in the rain in the middle of nowhere trying to change a crying babys nappy on the floor. I ignored them and continued to change her, when i was done i wrapped it up and put it in a nappy bag to dispose of when i got home. The whole journey home was constant remarks and comments about how i shouldve changed her nappy before i got on the bus. 
There was one particular woman, id say around 70, who said how disgusting it was that everyone else had to see that and i shouldve left her in the nappy until i was off the bus. I snapped and said judging by her age shes wearing nappies and would she like to be left in a shitty nappy for an hour, her mouth dropped and called me a rude girl who needs to learn manners, i said she was being bitchy for no reason and to calm down its just a nappy its not like i smeared poo all over the bus windows and down her walking stick.

1,"AITA for wanting to give my dog away? | My boyfriend and I got a puppy a few months ago. I paid for it, and pretty much pay for everything the puppy needs. Chi lives with me and I’m the one who primarily takes care of him. Every so often my boyfriend will take him for a night or a few days when I need a break. 

I live with my mom. My mom hates Chi like it’s her job. She used to let him in the living room when I’m at work (I work 40 hours a week and don’t get back until night time) but he would use the bathroom everywhere instead of his pads and my mom got tired of cleaning up after him. He uses his pads in my room though. So now he spends his entire existence inside of my bedroom, and as you can imagine it’s chaotic. My room is a mess with fur and toys and pads. He gets bored and has chewed up countless wires and items. I can’t leave anything in my room or else he’ll get to it. 

My genius attempt to remedy the situation was to get another puppy so Chi won’t be alone. It did work out, Chi is happier and gets along with Ki but he’s obsessed with Ki and harasses the puppy all day long. Chi plays rough and knocks him down. Chi won’t let Ki eat in peace or use the bathroom or sleep he’s always on him annoying him. I can’t keep them together when I’m gone and keep Ki in the living room. 

My mom likes Ki much better than Chi becuase he’s more well behaved and relaxed. Now, my mom has gotten it into her head that she wants Chi gone and she’ll allow me to keep Ki only. She screams and fights with me everyday about it. I’m stressed at work, and when I come home I’m even more stressed because of my mom and the dogs. I can’t keep them together alone because they egg each other on and I haven’t been able to sleep normally at nights because Chi barks and acts out since I keep Ki away from him. 

Chi is only well behaved and calm around my boyfriend. My boyfriend is used to hard headed dogs so he knows how to train him. Chi requires a lot of patience and time since you have to tell him the same thing a good half an hour straight before he gets it, and then he’ll do it again 20 minutes later and you have to start the process all over again. You can’t train him when he’s around Ki, and I can’t keep Ki away because he’s attached to me and cries when he’s not with me. It’s a chaotic mess and I can’t take care of both dogs anymore. 

Chi deserves a better home environment where he’ll get the attention he deserves and isn’t cooped up in a room all day. I want to rehome him but my boyfriend is against the idea completely and is attached to Chi. He says Chi is a valuable part of our relationship since we got him as a couple. He won’t let me attempt to give Chi a better home. 

My friends say I’m an asshole for trying to give the dog away and keeping the other one. My boyfriend won’t entertain the idea at all. I’ve asked him to take Chi home then if he likes the pup so much, but he’s never given me a solid answer.

1,"AITA for telling my sister she doesn’t understand lactose intolerance? | My (32F) little sister (21) found out she was lactose intolerant about 2 years ago and has not eaten ANY dairy since. She just completely cut it or if her diet even though most people who are lactose intolerant can enjoy small amounts of dairy no problem. She’s become annoying to go out to eat with because she always asks if there’s dairy in “x” dish. She also doesn’t eat meat so it’s doubly hard. 

My BF’s birthday was this weekend and she came over to hang out a bit. I got my BF a small grocery store cake to celebrate and offered some to my sister but she declined because of the dairy. I told her the amount of dairy in the cake was so small and mostly just butter which had barely any lactose in it she should be able to eat it no problem. She said maybe but at this point she hasnt eaten any dairy in over 2 years so the smallest amount now would probably make her sick. I tried to explain how most people with lactose intolerance can eat small amounts of dairy just fine but she still said she just wants to avoid dairy all together and she just feels so much better not eating it at all. 

I told her it was probably the placebo effect saying that to her and how I was frustrated going or to eat with her because we couldn’t share dishes anymore. She scoffed and said “You’re just mad because you’re also lactose intolerant but you don’t want to give up dairy so you just suffer anyways. You think it’s annoying going it with me? It’s annoying going out with YOU because you always eat the wrong things and need to find a washroom immediately.”

1,"AITA for potentially getting a guy kicked out of the YMCA for playing Pokemon Go? | I (F18) work at a food place that’s placed inside a YMCA. Its in the middle of a long hallway that leads to four hockey arenas and is secluded from the more popular areas of the Y such as the gym. it’s summer, no people except the staff of the Y that  aren’t near where my work is. Days are slow therefore I’m booked to work alone. Last saturday I had a shift, and no one was there except the casual gym nuts that ordering from my store. One man, mid 30s was one of my customers that day. I didn’t make much of it at first, he ordered some food from me and then that was that, a normal customer transaction. However, i noticed how he walked  back and forth every few minutes in the hallway between my store and the  arenas that lead to the gym. I really didn’t care at this point, and went onto minding my business. He continues to do so for three hours of my shift and I start freaking out, but i end up not doing anything except panic silently until the next person takes my shift.

Monday rolls by and I had a closing shift alone. 3 hours left of my shift the same guy comes back. He bought more food and this time i asked if he worked in the facility, and replied “no, i’m just visiting.” I felt uneasy about the whole interaction given what happened, but he left with his food right away and i took a breath of relief. However, 30 minutes later I see him once more pace the same path he took saturday, this time looking at his phone then into the store and everytime  He does this for another 2 hours and I continue to do my usual work routine, but now with shaky hands, avoiding  eye contact with this creep. I don’t deal really well with confrontations due to my anxiety so i quietly suffered in my nervous sweat alone. Thankfully my parents came to visit knowing I had a night shift. told them what was going on and was going on and was comforted. Since I had to start closing my mom went to go get the security for me to talk to, and dad stood guard while i cleaned the store. the staff gave me phone numbers and said they’d escort me if ever I felt unsafe. They also said that they’ve checked the cameras and even got the guy’s face and the next time he does this will be kicked out, doesn’t matter if its me who saw. The staff and I never confronted the guy but he continued to pace back and forth while i was talking to the staff and he ended up leaving since the place was closing for the night.

The man then told my dad that he was just playing Pokemon Go and even showed him his phone.

I've known her ex longer than she has. She made claims that her ex left because she was suffering from depression. Her ex made a post on facebook stating that it wasn't true, that he was leaving due to her temper and the fact that she refused to contribute at all, and instead she would rather play video games all day. He even uploaded a video showing her abandoning her cat(which she claimed he stole). He was trying to give her cat back to her and she actually refused to take it back. She's had that cat for a few years before she moved in with him. She seemed really petty in the video and it's really all it took to convince me that she was acting immature.

Over the weekend she was staying at my place and we have been having a great time. Like we’ve been making each other laugh, cooking together, did a little shopping together, it’s been a good time.

Fast forward to today, I have to go help setup for a holiday party that my work is sponsoring. She and I have been part of the planning committee, so we both are helping to set up for the party. Her and I start decorating one room, while other folks on the planning committee are decorating the other rooms. Once we’re all done, her and I get into her car and she says, “I need to go get gas!” I’m just like okay, yeah that’s fine.

On our way to the gas station we stop at a stoplight and we’re just joking around with each other. Some music is playing and the lyrics said “fuck you thought,” so I repeated it and she said, “What?” I just smiled and said, “Nothing!” Then she laughed and said “Get out.” From there we just joked about me actually getting out, walking away, never to be seen again.

As we pull into the gas station a minute later, she looks at me and says, “Okay, get out.” And I thought she was continuing the joke from earlier so I just smiled and said “No.” Then she sat there making funny faces for 30 seconds and she repeated, “Get out.” I leaned my seat back and said “No” (playfully) again. 

After that we just sat there in silence in the car for about 2 minutes before she said, “No seriously. Are we gonna do this or what?” I was confused because I’ve been waiting on her to get out of her car and get gas, so what was it that we were doing? I asked, “What are we doing?” And she responded with, “You need to get out and pump my gas.” I was kind of taken aback to be honest because it’s her car. We’ve only been hanging out as “more than friends” for like 2 weeks. Why would I pump your gas? So I said, “What? No, it’s your car.” Then she responded with, “Oh, so it’s like that.”

And she immediately got out after saying that and started to fill up her car. I was honestly confused because I couldn’t tell if she was joking with me or not.. Then she got in the car and she wouldn’t really talk to me. So, it was a silent ride home, she pulled up to my place, dropped me off, and said, “See you tomorrow.” (We work together..) No goodbye kiss/hug/wave. Pure cold shoulder.

We live in the same city as the rave, but we both decided that neither of us would be up to driving home that night (30 minute drive + general post-rave hectic-ness) and our hotel is less than a 10 minute walk from the venue. It's just one of those nights where we want to spend some time away from home too.

My friends (not super close, but we've been cool in the past) are from about 2 hours away. They didn't book a hotel room early because they were banking on sharing a hotel room with some other friends, but that fell through. Now the hotel prices are kind of getting expensive, so they asked if I would let them stay in my room and split the cost. I told them ""No, I booked it so I could chill with and fuck my boyfriend later that night."" Now they're calling me selfish for not letting them stay in my room, telling me how much of a waste it is for me to spend money when I could just go home when they don't have the choice.

1,"WIBTA if I call off my engagement over a scrapbook? | I (23f) am staying in my my fiance's (22m) flat while he's at work, done so many times with no issues. I decided to take a shower and go to get a towel when I see a picture frame on the shelf above (towels are kept un his wardrobe with his clothes and other stuff) I've seen it before as he's shown it to me but couldn't remember what it was.
Out of sheer curiosity go to grab said picture to take another look to remember what it was. (It was a frame of original film from one for the Harry Potter movies with the certificate of authenticity)
I wasn't snooping for anything else but as I grab it to look something falls off the top of the picture. (I'm 5ft 4"" and the shelf is above my head so I couldn't see the thing there)
What fell was a scrapbook saying 'our adventure' I pick it up and take a look.
 For some context as a Christmas gift to him I had  put together a scrapbook of lots of photos of us together and put 'our adventure' on the first page so assumed the one that fell was one he'd made for me in return. God I was so wrong.
Turns out the book that fell was made for him by his ex-gf full of photos of them together. Happy I was not. 
If the book was buried at the back of the wardrobe and I was snooping I'd say fair enough he just hasn't thrown it out yet. Because it's on top of a picture he's already shown me and the book wasn't there when he put the picture back in it's place my suspicions are raised and I'm feeling insecure.
Admittedly we haven't been together long (less than a year) but I believe long enough not to have stuff like that still hanging around. We agreed on a long engagement as not to rush things.

0,"AITA For Changing my Due Date just for my Mother | Throwaway account because my siblings Reddit.

My mother (who is in her late 70's) is a controlling & opinionated woman. You either love it or hate it. She's also from Greece and is strong on keeping traditions around the holidays. Christmas is always at her house and she is the only cook.

Since it's at her house, she is also left with all of the cleaning. My two sisters and brother try to help as much as possible,  but she'll refuse us (which leaves everything to her once we leave). We also cook but she doesn't want us to do it because we ""don't do it right"".  If we did bring something we've made,  she has no problem telling us how we need to make it better. We are all open for suggestions but her delivery can be harsh.

The  cherry on the top for every holiday is that she'll start to get  stressed as the day progresses.  Each time, she announces in a loud voice, ""Next year, we are going out to eat! I am not cooking again!"" And every year we agree and lock her down to a promise that is always broken by her.

This year, my siblings and I decided Christmas will be at one of our houses with Chinese food. It's the only ""outside food"" she likes. It took a few days but once we nailed down the details, I called my mother and told her to (1) Not to worry about her house - we'll be at sister's house. (2) We're buying the food, and it'll just be a relaxed holiday. She doesn't  have to do a thing except spend time with all of us and the εγγονια  (grandkids). (3) That we want her  there to finally relax and enjoy the day. But if this way of celebrating  Christmas this one time bothers her, we won't force her to come. And  that she's welcomed to come by after for baklava, coffee, and presents.

I explained that we are not happy with her stressing herself out on the  holidays, but if she won't accept help then she needs to (in gentler terms) shit or get off the pot. She wasn't thrilled, but she accepted.

Earlier this week, my sister calls me in confidence. My mother made her promise  not to say anything to me, but now my mother wants to have Christmas at her place. All the planning and compromises we did just went out the window.

I'm fumed. This isn't the first time she'll change her mind; when confronted, she'll just hug me, shush me and say, ""It's okay"".  Rinse and repeat.

I'm  currently pregnant with my baby. The doctor has planned on inducing  me the first week of February. My mother has repeatedly told me that she wants to be in the room with me because she cannot relax at home knowing I'm in labor. 

Today,  I called my mom and told her that the doctor is pushing the induction a week later due to improvement of health. I've decided not to call my  mom until my daughter is born. Once things are settled, I'll own the truth and when she gets upset, I'll hug her, shush her, and tell her  ""It's okay"" and promise next time it'll be different.

1,"AITA for not learning Italian? | For some context, my husband (33M) was born in the US but has dual citizenship as he is also an Italian citizen. He speaks Italian and is very engrossed in his Italian culture. He is always making his grandmothers recipes and he eats a lot of pasta and makes authentic Italian pizza. All his relatives live in Italy so he spends about half of his time there. He also owns a house there. He always asks me to come but I’ve only gone a few times as I (31F) feel very uncomfortable not being able to converse with the people there. When he married me, he asked me to promise to learn Italian. It is very important to him that his children know his language and can speak to his family. He also wants me to know it not only for those reasons but he says that Italian is close to Spanish and knowing Spanish will open up a lot of opportunities for me.

He started me on Duolingo but I have a full time job so it’s kind of difficult for me to do it everyday. I didn’t make much progress so he tried to teach me himself. As he is a native speaker, it was really hard for him to get into the shoes of a non-native speaker so him teaching me didn’t turn out well. He then signed me up for lessons twice a week. I started gong for the first few weeks but I didn’t learn anything so I stopped and started spending the time he thought I was at the lesson at restaurants.

His mother had been calling a lot more frequently lately. She called and I picked up. She talked very slowly but I still couldn’t understand her. Turns out that after that phone call, she called my husband and said that I wasn’t doing well at learning Italian. He talked to me and I admitted that I hadn’t been going for the past two years.

0,"WIBTA for not celebrating my friend's one-year of sobriety? | (Hear me out, please.) 

I have a friend, let's call her Joey, who was sober (alcohol and misc. drugs) for almost a year. I met her a few months before she got sober, and it's obviously a huge part of her life so our group of friends celebrates the big milestones with her. We threw her a dinner party at 3 and 6 months in, and had one planned for her 1 year anniversary this weekend. 

I've been cautious about celebrating her sobriety in the past - mainly because I think it puts a lot of pressure on her, but also because she's the type of person who *doesn't* want it recognized. She wants to be the ""normal girl who doesn't need to keep track of when her last drink was,"" (her words, not mine) but she appreciates our little groups' get-togethers. 

That all being said...she went on a bender two weeks ago. Got incredibly drunk, scored some pills, and got into a car wreck. She's been very apologetic/remorseful and has gone to AA/NA meetings over the past few days. Side note: we're all super supportive of her, and she has come to us in the past about struggling with addiction. A lot of us are in the mental health field, mainly counselors, so we're all very open about our problems. 

However, my friends still want to throw her an one-year sobriety party. Like the whole shebang - 1-year cupcakes, food in the shape of 1s, party banner, etc - their theme hasn't changed. Their argument is that she *almost* made it to one-year and we should celebrate that as an accomplishment. I disagree. She's made it very clear that she wants to move past it all and start over (to the point that she's currently saying she's been sober for 1 week), and I don't think throwing a party for what *was* her one-year anniversary is going to help her. Honestly, I think it might cause her to spiral. 

Out of the group, overwhelmingly they thought I was being unfair to bring it up, and they want to throw her a party. A handful of people agree with me, but would I be the asshole to not show up to this party? I don't want to hurt Joey, but I don't want her to be feel some ridiculous pressure to be sober again so shortly after a pretty massive bender. 

TLDR: WIBTA if I don't go to my friend's sober party? She was sober for almost a year, got fucked up, and has been sober for a week. Friends are still planning on celebrating a year sober. 

P.S. I wouldn't be against the party if it weren't for the 1-year thing. I want to be there for her as much as possible, but I don't think it's fair to Joey to get a huge reminder of her last few weeks. She's struggling a bit right now.",False,False

After she lost custody her mom/my other grandma and her sisters basically disowned her and even though she tried to come over to family get together and visit and call me, the family always prevented it. My half brother was older so he always saw her because his side of the family didn't have the same hate for her. Now he thinks I'm wrong for this but the grandmother that didn't raise me (mom's mom) cut my mom out of the will and left her part to me instead, as well as her other four kids who are all well off. My brother told me it was inappropriate to take this inheritance as my mother is unable to work and destitute and could use her inheritance to bring her house up to code. The rest of the family said it was OK to take it because my mom didn't raise me or spend any money on me. So we all hid the fact she was cut out of the will and got her to sign papers saying she wouldn't contest it. Since she is mentally ill she didn't realize anything was wrong until the money was all dispersed and someone accidently told her.

0,"AITA for encouraging my wife to not take her recently prescribed meds | I realize the answer to the question is usually instant YTA but I think this might be an exception.

Everyone's 1st question will be ""are you a medical professional""? My answer to that is complicated. I am not a medical doctor and am not licensed to prescribe meds. However, I am a medical researcher at a top 10 medical school in the US. My specialty is actually in drug development. My knowledge is different than that of a medical Dr (deeper in some areas and more shallow in others). I've taken many of the MD classes and actually taught a few of them. Hopefully I've conveyed that while I'm not a medical doctor, I am certainly not giving my wife medical advice after reading webMD for a day.

My wife already takes 3 mental health meds, 1 being a controlled substance. This is great. These meds help her with her diagnosed issues. Today my wife was prescribed another controlled substance, a very addictive one, which is used to treat a condition that she does NOT have! She is not diagnosed with this condition and I see no evidence of her having symptoms of it. I am incredibly sketched out by this doctor for prescribing her this! Additional concerns: 

1) She has taken this med before recreationally. After taking it 3 consecutive days, she showed odd behavior - got unreasonably angry that she couldn't take it again. (her doc does not know this)

2) There is a history of addiction to this type of drug in her family. Her uncle died from an overdose of a different, more intense drug of this type (her doc does know this!). 

Given all of this, I strongly advised by wife against taking this medicine. I told her that if chooses to take the med, that I will only support that decision if she gets a 2nd opinion from another psychiatrist... I very highly doubt another psych would agree to her taking this medicine.

My wife never cut men’s hair, including my own or our son’s, only women’s, including our daughters. She claims it’s what she was trained in and what she felt most comfortable with. In the 18 years we’ve been married, I respected that and went to a barber. 

My job is considered essential and I still have to leave the house to go to work every day. It’s considered professional dress, most of the men have maintained, short haircuts. I’ve kept this up over the years. However, my barber was shut down for obvious reasons and my hair is getting long. I asked my wife to make an exception and please give my hair a trim over the weekend so it could maintain a “professional” style. She refused and said “I don’t cut men’s hair”. I was frustrated but didn’t show it outwardly and told her that was fine.

I came home today from work and my eldest daughter has a new haircut, with highlights. All done by my wife. She looks beautiful. But I admit that I was irritated that she refused to even do a trim for me when I have to maintain a professional look and yet gave our daughter a new look when she can’t leave the house because of all going on.

I tried telling him before that he shouldn't. He's said he doesn't keep his eyes on the phone, that he makes sure to look back up quickly. 

Well we just left for a trip, he had already been using his phone. We were passing a spot in the left lane on our side of a divided section of roads, the right lane of our side was backed up. A car pulls out in front of the car in the right lane, to turn, right in front of us.

He whipped to the left to avoid, and quickly back to the right to get back in our lane. The cars didn't even touch.

He obviously celebrated. But I couldn't help but feel like my point had been proven. If he had been on his phone at that moment, even if he had looked up, there wouldn't haven been enough time for him to react. 

I said this, and he told me not to ruin the mood. Which just pisses me off. We kinda argued about it when I wasn't talking to him. He said my fear from the near accident has made ""overzealous"" with my safety concerns.

1,"AITA For telling not being friends with women | So I (31M) work in an office and me and this girl (26F) sit at at the same table and talk a lot just to pass the time.

Recently she has started asking me to go out for drinks on Friday after work (as friends not a date). I made excuses why I could not for a couple of weeks, but then she asked me if I disliked her, I thought I would just tell her the truth that I do not do friendships with women.

I do not recall what I said verbatim however the gist of it is that, if I spend prolonged time with a woman I start feeling for a lack of a better word 'territorial'. If they start talking with other guys or get attention from them I my intestines start roiling and I feel an extreme sense of agitation (I never act on it and I put on a happy face and persevere) however I hate said feeling and prefer to avoid it and hence I do not do friendships with women. 

She then said I should see a psychologist (I will not, even though I am flawed, my flaws make up a part of who I am and I do not wish to change), and since then for the past couple of weeks our talking has just been work related.

I do get same feelings at work however I do not think about work at home and its work so I have no choice but to tolerate them. However I do not wish to put myself through unnecessary discomfort willingly outside of work. I do not wish to feel this way, I know it is not correct, again I never act on it, but I can not help feeling it.

I had told this story to a guy I know and he said I must have been be controlling with my previous girlfriends. So just in case people here will make that assumption, it could not be further from the truth. If the lady is already mine I do not mind her talking to or being around other guys, I think because I know she is mine it makes me happy thinking other men might want what I have and can not have it.",False,False
1,"AITA for throwing my boyfriend's belongings out the window after he snapped at me? | I’ve known my boyfriend for a pretty long time, and we finally started dating early this year. I really like being with him, and the feeling seems to be mutual. He’s very affectionate and makes me feel loved. We talk about our future plans a lot. He also has a daughter, who I met once & she apparently “loved me,” and we’ve met each other’s parents so I think things have been getting somewhat serious.

Last night, he invited me to a show at a bar where some of his friend’s bands were playing. I didn’t really want to go because I was super tired (in hindsight I should’ve stayed the fuck home and avoided this whole situation...) but I agreed anyway because I wanted to spend time with him. I’m extremely introverted while he has some outgoing tendencies, so I let him socialize with his friends and do his thing while I sat at the bar. No big deal, I've done this plenty of times. Doesn't bother me, and it seems to work for us.

After about two hours, the bands finished playing and it was getting late (about 11:30) and we needed to head back to my apartment because we both had work in the morning. I asked him if we could leave, but he kept insisting he wasn’t done socializing and needed to say goodbyes. I stood outside in the rain in a dry area and waited for him. After ten minutes, I started texting him saying “LET’S GOOO!!!” and called him so he’d get a move on.

When started driving home, he fucking. lost. it. He started screaming about how I’m trying to control him, how I’m ""Hitler"", how I’m a narcissist and will never be successful in my career or amount to anything. He even said some misogynist shit about women being psychos. I tried to calm him down, because I’ve NEVER had a partner yell at me like that before and it was scary. He wouldn’t change his tone and rationally discuss why he was upset with me. He wasn’t willing to work towards a solution and understand each other’s perspectives. Instead, I was the fucking worst person in the world because I wanted to go home after sitting by myself for two hours while he caught up with friends. In retaliation, I called him a deadbeat dad (he only sees his kid a few times a month) and that his only redeeming quality is that he is attractive. I knew these were low blows, but I felt like I was being attacked and didn’t know what the hell to do because he wouldn't cooperate with me. Obviously, it didn’t go over well.

This is where it gets really messy. After we arrived at my house, I locked him outside and told him to go away. He refused to leave until I gave him back his overnight bag. So I emptied out the contents, and dramatically threw them out the window. So his clothes were scattered around the parking lot, now wet from the rain.

In the morning, I received a text from him that said “well that sucked but I refuse to be around that behavior” and he blocked me on social media.

0,"AITA for not taking my girlfriend's advice for my art? | My girlfriend has been an artist for a much longer time compared to me. However we have very different styles and I prefer to complete my art without unsolicited advice which my girlfriend constantly gives. Usually I just nod my head and ignore it and complete my works the way I want to. 

Recently she has been feeling extremely insecure. At the beginning of this year I started social media accounts for my art works and amassed a lot of followers in a short amount of time. It's 5x what my girlfriend has despite the fact that she has been on social media for a longer time. I do both digital and traditional art while my girlfriend only does digital art. 

Because of this she feels that she's inferior as an artist and that i reinforce her feelings when I don't follow her advice. I've never said anything negative about her art works. But I prefer to work on my art alone. 

These past few weeks I was doing a charcoal portrait of my late Aunt for my grandparents. This is a very personal piece as my aunt had passed away suddenly and it left a huge hole in my family. It was requested by my grandmother. I already had a solid idea of what I wanted to do. My girlfriend told me to redraw certain parts of the sketch but I thought it was fine and went ahead with the sketch. The finished portrait was lovely and my grandmother loved it. When my gf saw the piece she was really upset. She blew up at me saying how I never appreciate her as an artist. We haven't spoken in 5 days. She wants me to apologise but I really don't think I did anything wrong. I don't agree with her advice and besides she has no experience in charcoal drawing so why would I take her advice?

I specifically cant remember what I was doing but, I do remember this group of 3 girls walking to me (well call them G1 G2 and BG for b-day girl also I don't know who they are I have sen them in the halls but I have never spoken to them) I look at them and G1 says ""can you give that blanket to my best friend because it's her birthday and you won so many other things while she won nothing"" I said no I had earned this its mine why don't you give one of your items to her instead(she also had a blanket). G1 then replies with ""you're being a selfish jerk why won't you just give it to her it's her birthday and I only have this one thing while you have many"" I still say no and I add that I barely even know you guys but if she really wanted that blanket she should've been good in school (i didn't really know them but knew enough about them to they were bad) BG starts crying saying that she deserves the blanket more then me, so I just ignore them because I knew I was getting nowhere with this argument G1 and G2 call me a selfish jerk and walk off while BG is crying her ass off because she couldn't get my blanket. I personally feel like I was in no wrong but as I think about it more and more it was just a blanket should I have given it to her because it was her birthday am I the asshole.",False,False
0,"AITA for flipping out on old lady while my son was locked in hot car | I have been brought up to respect my elders and have never done anything like this before. I think it was my adrenaline rushing and also I’m super emotional because I am pregnant again. Yesterday I took my baby to Kohl’s and while getting his stroller unfolded from the truck, I fucked up bad. I left my purse with keys and phone in the car, with the baby (to keep him calm while I get stroller ready for him). I close my trunk, come around to his door and it’s locked. Every door is locked. It’s 85 degrees out and I’m just watching him play with my bag and I can’t get in or call anyone. I immediately started screaming for help and a couple came over and called 911 and let me use their phone to call my husband. One guy ran to the autozone in the parking lot to see if they have something to break in. I was ready to break the window. People were running over and looking in my car, comforting me, calling for help. I was hysterical and nothing anyone said made me feel better. And then it happened: some older lady came up to the crowd and asked very loudly right next to me “the parents went into shop and left the baby in the car- they should be ashamed of themselves”. And I lost it. I was screaming at her I don’t remember what I said- I sort of blacked out. And it was in front of everyone there. I demanded she leave and go away. She was like my grandmas age. The police came and two guys each had this contraption of a balloon thing out between the car door and stuck a stick in to press the unlock button. From the first call to the door opening was 9 minutes but I thought it was an hour. The baby was alright, and never even cried. We hung out in the cop car to cool off while the crowd dissipated. This was all yesterday and the only thing I can’t get over is how I treated that old lady in front of everyone. My behavior upset me more than the whole incident. AITA here",False,False

0,"AITA for telling my gf that she shouldn't go skinny dipping with her friend's group, especially because it's mixed gender and she told me how one of her friends had a crush on her (not anymore allegedly). | This is a silly argument and I really hope she listens to me. The facts.

* We've been dating for about eight months and it's going great!

* My gf recently lost a bunch of weight and is really enjoying her new found body image and confidence. I'm very happy for her.

* She has a close knit group of friends and they go camping and swimming outdoors, often skinny dipping. They have a trip to Hawaii in a week with a lot of camping and outdoor activities. I won't unfortunately be able to join them.

* Considering that she's now in a steady relationship and she confessed that one of her friends had expressed his feelings for her and they'd been in a fling for a while (but never went anywhere) I thought she shouldn't be doing anything that adds any tension to the group.

* She thinks it's long in the past (less than 3 years) and shouldn't be an issue and that me insisting on what she does is somewhat controlling.

* I think it's just common sense and I can express my discomfort can't I? I also worry she's getting carried away with how well her exercise and diet regimen has paid off.

0,"AITA for not giving poor kids free stuff at a craft faire? | I vended at my first ever craft show a few weeks ago. It was a small craft show hosted by a local church. I was selling handmade jewelry ranging in price from $3-$50. There was a group of about 7 kids who were running from table to table, looking at things and playing, very cute. They stopped by my table and were touching and trying on my jewelry which I did not mind at all. The kids kept picking up jewelry and asking  how much it was, they were selecting my more expensive pieces ($25-50) they were clearly getting upset that my prettier jewelry was so expensive, so I offered them to look at some of my cheaper pieces ($3-5) which they said they did not like, and they left my table. 
The lady in the table next to me turned to me and angrily said ‘You know those kids are very poor!’ Which I told her I did not, nor did I know what she wanted me to do with this information.
Later my booth neighbor called the kids over and gave them some of her homemade things (which she priced between $30-80) which the kids were happy with and ran off playing.
Some of the kids kept coming back to my table to look at my expensive jewelry, but didn’t say anything to me.
When it was time to leave the lady told me that maybe I shouldn’t return to craft faires if I wasn’t going to be generous...
Looking back I guess I could have given the kids some of my more expensive jewelry, it would have just costed me the materials and a few hours of my labor, but I did offer the kids cheaper jewelry that I would have been more comfortable parting with for free...however by that time in the faire I had sold enough to cover the cost of my table, and made a small profit from the event, so I wasn’t going to be losing money at this faire.
AITA for not giving the poor kids some of my more expensive product? Is this something I should prepare for for future craft faires? It was my first faire and I don’t know what the culture of these events are like. I hate to think I was an A** without meaning to be.",False,False

0,"AITA for posting about my weight gain on Instagram? | I've pretty much struggled with my weight all my life. I wasn't overweight as a kid but I always was self conscious about the way I looked, especially my chubby cheeks which stayed with me well into my teens.

I did all the diets, forced myself to skip meals and worked out and did sports a lot from 12-17 years old. Pretty much everyone around me noticed it and were concerned about my eating habits but I always shrugged them off telling them I was fine. All I wanted to do was get rid of my cheeks but they always stayed the same shape no matter how much weight I lost. My parents noticed how bad I looked and forced me to go to a doctor. He was really worried about my weight as I was 48kg and 5'5 at the time but I shrugged him off for years thinking I was fine. 

Until one day I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I'm never gonna lose these fucking cheeks no matter how hard I tried to lose them and started to force myself back into eating.
 
Long story short, I finally started gaining weight again and noticed the difference and was really happy about it. After a year and  a half I've gained 11kg and now weight 59 kg and was pretty proud of how far I've come. I posted a video of me going on a weighing scale while the lyrics on Anaconda played ""Fuck those skinny bitches in the club"" and wrote a caption explaining how I was poking fun at myself for being skinny but finally being able to gain weight again. I thought it would go fine since most of my friends know how hard it's been for me to realize how fucked up my eating habits were. 

One of my friends replied and said I was an asshole because I was making fun of overweight people and how much harder they have it compared to me and I should go eat a sandwich. I was really surprised because I didn't think I was fat shaming anyone at all but now I'm not too sure. I don't know if I was being insensitive or not but it wasn't my intentjon.

0,"AITA for giving my wife her own property as a present? | This happened several years ago with my now ex wife. Let's call her ""Shannon"". I've wondered over the years if I was in the wrong or not so I'm looking to the Reddit community for input.  
 Shannon has a rocking chair, made for small children, that used to belong to her grandmother.  It was given to her when her grandmother passed away.  Shannon has fond memories of using it when she was young. So there is some sentimental value there.
 Since it came into our house, our dog gnawed on the exposed wood and seat fabric. Because of the damage the chair was moved into a back corner of the house and basically forgotten about.  I snuck the chair out of the house and had it professionally restored. It looked and functioned better than when Shannon got it.  
I gifted it back to Shannon.  I viewed it as giving new life to a neglected and damaged family heirloom that our kids can now use and create their own memories with.  Shannon says I'm an asshole for essentially wrapping up something already in the house and giving it back to her.

1,"AITA for rescuing a hamster against my BF's wishes? | I'm (28F) a huge animal lover - I work at a wildlife rehab center and have my own personal pets. My BF (27M) doesn't really understand my passion for animals. He never grew up around them and has never had much of an interest in my pets. He likes them, but he doesn't want anymore. When we moved in together a year ago, I had 3 geckos, 2 snakes, 2 rabbits, a turtle, 3 guinea pigs, a fish tank, a parrot, and 4 hamsters. They are all rescues. My boyfriend has expressed that he does not want anymore animals, and I have felt like 16 animals + a tank is a pretty solid compromise. Although I am within my means to care for all of these animals and they all get loads of personal attention, I don't want to bring in more animals than I can care for. 16 is a good number for me at the moment.

My boyfriend does not like my hams, rabbits, or guineas. He will engage with my other pets, but finds those 9 to be absolutely repulsive, which sucks because they're the animals I have felt such a deep connection with.

A few days ago, I got a message from a friend, who said that someone they knew had a hamster that needed to be rehomed due to health issues. I asked for some photos of the animal, to see it's condition. The hamster was in extremely poor shape and when I reached out to local rescues, they all admitted they didn't have the ability to properly care for it. The photos I received showed a lot of clear neglect, and I knew I had to help out.

The day after I found out about the hamster, I texted my boyfriend to let him know I was planning on fostering a rescue ham, and assured him it would be very temporary. I no longer foster since moving in with my boyfriend, but before we lived together, I was a frequent foster carer for cats, dogs, rodents, etc. He didn't respond, but I went to go pick up the hamster so that I could bring it into a vet. In person, I could tell it's condition was much worse than initially represented, so I rushed it to the vet. Once I had gotten there, I saw I had a number of texts from my boyfriend.

He told me I was not allowed to bring the hamster home. He said he would seriously reconsider our relationship if I brought it home. He was absolutely furious. I told him the hamster was extremely sick and needed the help, but he wasn't listening. I tried to remind him that it was only temporary, but he said that I was being ridiculous and I was violating our agreement. Trying to compromise, I told him I would have the hamster rehomed in a week. He told me that I could either leave the rescue, or get rid of one of my personal hams and swap the rescue in for it. 

I know I went against what he explicitly asked. I just couldn't stand to see this baby suffer. The hamster had to be put down at the vet, so he never got to come home with me. My boyfriend is still deeply upset and things have been awful in our relationship since.

1,"AITA for not wanting to share my bonus check with my husband? | My husband and I have been together for 9 years, married for 5. He supported me through college and we support my disabled mother.

My job was great until the company was sold to a larger company. The merger was horrible, soulcrushing, and drove me to a breakdown. I ended up quitting 2 days into my two week notice after a particularly horrible night after working months for 80 hrs a week.

They hired me back almost two months ago with a significant raise. I had thought they had already paid the bonuses from the merger that we were promised, but was pleasantly surprised that they were paid out yesterday and they still allowed me to be eligible even though I was gone for five months.

It's not a lot, but it would've allowed me to update my computer. My husband got pouty/jealous (his hardware is older) and pretty much reminded me he didn't get anything for his birthday because I was unemployed and behind on bills. We had used our stimulus to catch up on all of our bills. My raise has also made it so we can start a nice savings and continue our retirement accounts.

I ended up giving him half to buy a birthday present and for some fun money, but I'm feeling a little salty about it. 

He's a great husband, supports me unconditionally, but last night he used the, ""If I got a bonus, you'd feel the same way."" I don't think I would. I think I would've been happy for him and told him to buy whatever he wants. We never spend over $200 without consulting each other on the purchase and that would've been a good chance.

1,"AITA for siding with my friend’s boyfriend instead of my friend on matters relating to her breast implants? | I went over to my friend’s house yesterday to hang out with her. Her boyfriend was also there. My friend and I talked amongst ourselves and she complained about her boyfriend bitching about her breast implants that she got three months ago. We haven’t really talked about her implants before. Her boyfriend overheard and this started an argument. Her boyfriend said that she has these scars under each breast that still are noticeable and off-putting so he’s justified in not wanting to do anything with them until they’ve healed. My friend said they’re barely even noticeable and was in the process of showing them to me before I told her that I didn’t want to see her breasts. 


She said that her boyfriend is making her feel very bad about her decision, even though she did it to be less self-conscious with her previous A cups. Her boyfriend said they were a lot better before and not like cantaloupes glued to her chest. He also said that she’s really financially irresponsible for using all of the trust fund money she got from her aunt after she died on breast implants. He said that 20 year olds shouldn’t be spending $8000 on breast implants. My friend said that her boyfriend knew that she has been wanting implants for a long time, so the least he can do is be happy for her. 


Her boyfriend asked me what I thought and I said although her boyfriend should try to act more supportive of her, I ultimately side with him. I said that the breast implants probably aren’t the best use of her money since we’re in college and her future career doesn’t depend on having big breasts. I also said that although her satisfaction is the most important, but frankly from her boyfriend’s, mine, and I assume most people’s perspectives, her new breasts are out of proportion with her petite figure. Her boyfriend said that he tried so hard to convince not to mutilate her body, but she wouldn’t listen. 


My friend said that she thought I would have her back and not shit all over what was a major life decision that made her infinitely happier with her body. I said that her happiness is the most important, but she needs to prepare for people who think her breasts are a little bit ridiculous and her spending a little bit frivolous. Her boyfriend put out his hand for a high five, but that was immature and inappropriate so I didn’t high five him. 


I asked my friend what her parents thought of her spending $8000 on breast implants. She said they didn’t care. Having known her mom for a while now, I smelled bullshit but I didn’t say anything about that. My friend said that after knowing what it’s like to have both small and big breasts, that big breasts get much more attention and she was jealous of girls with big breasts before and that’s what I am now when I put her down. I told her to stop being a bitch. We argued further for a bit before I left early because I couldn’t take it anymore.",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my wife to use less alarms or I’m going to sleep in another room | My wife is 2 months pregnant and for some reason since she got pregnant she’s been unable to wake up in the morning. She’s been setting like 6 alarms 15 minutes apart for an hour before she wakes up, and she gets up for work 2 hours before me.

I’ve told her that the alarms are driving me nuts and she has to get up with one or two but she’s still using them. I’m finally sleep deprived enough that I told her either set less alarms or I’m going to sleep in the guest room because getting 6 hours of sleep is killing me.

She said I can’t sleep in the guest room because she can’t sleep without me. That’s crap, I’ve seen her sleep without me a ton, such as on the sofa, and many times when she goes to bed early and I have a day off of work and go to be late.

0,"AITA for suggesting my (30m) wife (33f) get professional help? | Recently my wife has been having quite a few issues with mood swings and what I call overbearing behavior with our two children (3m & 1.5m). She will wake up or come home from work and be her normal self. Laughing, talking and playing with the kids but the tiniest thing will send her into a tailspin and she'll begin snapping at all three of us. She claims this is post-partum rage.

Recently it's gotten worse because her parents had to move in with us when her father got laid off. They're doing what they can to move out but haven't been very succesful. I think it's been great having them around because they are both very helpful around the house and are willing to babysit. 

However my wife hasn't been able to ""self-medicate"" with weed because her father disapproves. It came to ahead last night when I made mention my sister dropped by our oldest's school for a quick visit. Our son adores his aunt and had a blast ""touring"" her through his pre-k class. 

My wife thinks this was WAY over the line and has caused my family to believe they've done something wrong (my mom suggested my sister visit him). I don't think they have. So this caused a fight between us and I suggested my wife get professional help even suggesting we go together. This sent her into a fury because she believed I was siding with my family over her (I haven't said anything to my family).

1,"AITA for not preventing my dogs from barking? | I have two dogs (German Shepard/Poodle mix) that are about 8 months old.  They have crackhead energy and are always cranked up to 11, even with daily walks and tons of time playing with them.

This past Saturday, my fiancee got home to find a note taped to our front door (I was at work) that read (paraphrased):  ""We love the pups, but they wake us up every day of the week.  Today it was at 6:47 am.  Please help.""  No indication of who it came from.

Our HOA has a ""no noise"" curfew of 10:00 pm to 6:00 am.  I am 100% positive they've never barked during that quiet time.  Outside that quiet time, I could mow my yard or start hammering nails in without breaking any rules.  Furthermore, this is a very family-oriented neighborhood.  There are kids screaming/playing and dogs barking all the time.  It's never bothered me, because that's what you get when you move into the suburbs.

My fiancee and I both leave the house for work around 6:30 in the morning.  The dogs have a dog door that they use to go in and out to the backyard.  Neither of us get back until around 6:00 in the evening.  I have no interest in restricting their access to the backyard while they spend most nearly the entire day alone.

We are training them to not bark and not jump on people, and all the other general courtesies dogs should know, but they're puppies and they have a ton of energy.  I have no doubt that they're barking at the other dogs (there's a park right behind our house), but I'm also not interested in doing anything else to keep them quiet, especially since I've been woken up by home improvement projects, mowing, or kids playing outside multiple times.

1,"AITA for brake-checking a tailgater causing her to swerve and hit a tree? | Before we begin: I 100% think that I'm the asshole, but the police don't. 

16M, I just got my license and my mom has given me her old car so ya know, usual teen driver stuff.

Anyways I'm just driving along on a... backroad? It's rural and plenty of room to pass, also very sparsely policed so it's an amazing driving road. I'm doing a slight bit over the speed limit, 65ish in 55 or something like that when I notice a car behind me flashing brights like... tf? ok? So I maintain speed because 1. any faster and it would be a bit sketchy if on the off chance there was a cop on this road and 2. it's a broken yellow so she can pass. 

Of course this doesn't happen, bright flashing for the next ten or so miles. I'm a bit pissed so I do a brake check, nothing too major but still enough to be considered a brake check. Next thing I know this lady's Escalade was in the tree by the side of the road. It's an escalade so she's fine, but is now pissed at me for the brake check that caused her to swerve. Also, she admitted to texting which made the police that we called put her 100% at fault. My car is fine. but i think her's is totaled, esp. since it was older.

Basically, I think that I'm at least somewhat at fault. I'm not arguing with the police for sure, but personally I think i'm the asshole or ESH.

1,"AITA for splitting the Uber costs 50/50 even though there were 3 of us? | Pretty short story. This happened back around Christmas. My girlfriend and I (we live together) had a flight out of LAX during the holiday week. As you can guess, this can get expensive especially during peak hours and living 45-60 minutes away from the airport. Thankfully, we have a friend who also needed to go to the airport, so we offered to pick him up in the Uber on the way to the airport. He lives just a mile or two away from us but in the direction of the airport. 

&#x200B;

   The Uber ended up being around $90. Since I called the Uber, I paid for it and then we split ways from our other friend as he was flying elsewhere. I send him a request for $45, half of the ride. Usually, the entire fare would've been paid by my girlfriend or myself as we don't go around splitting everything. We figure that it all just ends up close to even at the end of the day. So I figure that we count as one entity and that my friend counts as another one. He doesn't think he should be paying 50% but rather 1/3. This hasn't really hindered our friendship too much but I haven't seen him since the request for money and he refuses to talk about it when I bring it up unless I'm willing to drop the $15 difference it would be.

1,"WIBTA for keeping original drawings that I ""gave"" away due to miscommunication? | I draw on sticky notes at work, little cartoons and creatures and such. A coworker who is a couple years younger than me (I'm 23) likes my artwork, and since it made him happy I let him post the sticky notes all over his desk space. I never thought much of it. There was never any formal conversation about who owned the drawings, whether or not I was giving them to him, etc. There were a lot of instances of the following: ""I drew this thing, he's not here right now/we're both fairly busy so I'll leave it at his desk for him to see later."" Again, I didn't mind them being kept at his desk, and was glad he enjoyed them. It soon also turned into ""I drew this thing, I'm showing it to him, oh ok he's hanging it up."" Soon after that, I'd draw something (sometimes with the intent to take it home with me) and if he saw it/I showed it to him independent of his desk space he'd take it and put it there. A little weird, but again, nothing that I was too focused on, after all, it's where the rest of my artwork was. Super casual, no biggie.

This coworker is moving on to a new opportunity. I told him about a month ago that I was going to take home the sticky notes (there are about 60 of them from the past year and a half or so) and scan them. He jokingly said ""nooooooooooo,"" and I didn't think much of it. He then said that he wants the originals, not the copies. I mean, I did leave them at his desk, but it's occurring to me that he *feels* that I gave them all to him, and that they were all made for him, when that was not the intent. Only about 10 were made for him specifically.

I know this is a miscommunication that could have been easily avoided by having a conversation on the ""conditions"" of the ""giving/using/displaying"" of the drawings, but... Again, it just was not something I was focused on. And now I'm not sure if I'd be an asshole for suggesting that I should keep the originals that I didn't make specifically for him, when it seems like I've given them to him.

1,"AITA for letting my best-friend’s boyfriend have access to my private Snapchat? | I have a private Snapchat that I charge for access to. I try to be artistic about it, I have regular customers, it works well for me. Do not inbox me about it. 

I don’t talk much with others about this side of my life, but my friends are aware that I do it. 

My best-friend Megan has been dating Charlie for a little over six months. We’ve all hung out together, we’re all cool. 

Well, earlier this week, I was managing new subscriptions, and I got a Venmo payment from a number in my contacts, as you probably already guessed, it was Charlie. Charlie didn’t seem to remember that I had his phone number from times Megan called me using his phone.  He had a weird user name and no picture. I shrugged it off, and let him have access. He only paid for three days, I’m in no position to turn down money. 

I tried to call Megan later that day, but I couldn’t get a hold of her. When I talked to her the following day, I told her what happened. She didn’t believe me, so I sent her relevant screen shots. I even sent her screenshots of the Snapchat he’s using, showing that he viewed the story from that evening prior. That’s when her anger turned to me. She’s all “how could you give him the Snapchat??” And “what the fuck is wrong with me?” And all this. I informed her that he’s a paying customer, and that I technically didn’t have to and shouldn’t have told her about this in the first place. He paid for three days of access and I let him have it. He could just as easily see millions of other women naked online. We started yelling at each other, and ended up hanging up the phone.

It’s the end of the week and I still haven’t spoken to her. She is refusing contact with me if I don’t apologize to her first. I just do not think that I’m “wrong” in this scenario, and that I shouldn’t have to apologize before talking it out. I don’t see how I’m wrong for giving him something that he paid for.

I don't often babysit my nephew (9) and niece (6) but my sister had somewhere to be and couldn't get her usual babysitter. She asked me and since I had the day off and enjoy seeing them, I said yes.

I told my nephew that I had to go to work for a little bit but that he could stay and play, and I also emphasized ""watch over your niece."" My nephew is a very responsible kid so I trusted him. And there was a lot of people/kids at the playground too.

I get to work and the issue turns out to be more complex than I anticipated and it took me about 2.5 hours to resolve. Afterwards I get back to the playground and most people had left, but my niece and nephew were still there fortunately.

On the way home we spoke and they made a couple of friends and seemed like they had a good time. Later when my sister asked how did everything go, she went apeshit when I told them I left them alone. She told me what I did was irresponsible, which I don't understand because when we were kids we were left alone a lot.

She berated and was yelling at me and I got defensive and told her ""when you decide to stop being a bitch and calm down, then maybe we can have a more civil conversation about this."" 

I simply couldn't talk to her because she was barely letting me get in a word edgewise. So that's my story, just want to see if I was an asshole for leaving them alone.",False,False

So I’m a dog owner, and I have 3 roommates. We all constantly have friends over so there are typically a lot of people seeing my dog. Everyone loves him because he’s super friendly and playful and loves meeting new people too. He’s a year and a half old purebred Australian Shepherd.

I haven’t gotten him fixed. I know this contradicts my earlier statement of supporting fixing your animals. There are a couple reasons I don’t think I will get him fixed. The first being that I know fixing a dog can change there personality and he has a perfect personality so I’m worried he won’t be the same afterwards. Also, I’m not sure if I ever will try to get him to have puppies but I’ve definitely thought about it because I would love to have one of his pups in my home down the road.

The other day I was out and my roommate and his girlfriend started getting upset with me for not fixing him. Saying that more of our friends would take him out and go places if he were fixed and that not fixing him can lead to disease later on in his life. I explained to them my dilemma but they firmly stood on the opposing side of my views.

This week however he felt inspired to cook so asked my mom if he could try making a dish for everyone tonight. 

He made this lamb dish with roasted potatoes and other vegetables and it was really good and he plated it up all nice before serving but he let the plates sit out for a while on the counter before serving. I think as a chef he’s used to just plating a dish at his restaurant he works at and having a waiter take it away hot to the table very soon after. That didn’t happen because after he plated them up he was doing something else and then a bit of cleaning so after only a couple minutes of eating the dishes were getting cold. When we asked if they were ready when we saw them sitting out he said not to sit down yet.  

I went to microwave mine for a bit to warm it back up. When I came back to the table my brother looked pretty pissed off. He asked if something was wrong with dinner. I told him that no it was really great it had just gotten cool and I’m a slow eater so I needed to warm it back up. He didn’t say anything the rest of dinner.

He has been married for over 10 years and his wife is completely unaware of what is going on. I will also add that I know his wife very well and am very friendly with her. I felt obligated to do something about, since I feel as though I am friends with both my close friend and his wife.

I ended up using a google voice phone number to send a text message to his wife from a number she had never received before, the message provided a detail about her that I knew would make her believe it wasn't fraudulent or a ""scammer"" trying to get her attention, then I explained what she needed to do to find out the infidelities that her husband had committed.

My friend of many years has been kicked out, seems to be struggling with what happened and is completely clueless about how his wife found out about what happened and is extremely pissed off about it.

I haven’t ever gotten one and had nothing else going on so I asked how much ($25) where at (a few blocks away) and said yes. 
I was gonna get clear nail polish but someone who worked there suggested yellow and I was like sure why not. My pal also said yellow sounded great and I personally didn’t care too much. I wasn’t getting a pedicure to show off my toenails, I just kinda did it because I was bored and hadn’t seen this particular pal for a few months and thought it would be fun to catch up.

1,"WIBTA for slacking on all my responsibilities once I get into my dream college? | Ivy Day (the day Ivy League schools release their college decision) is March 28. What a lot of colleges, including Ivies, do to stop applicants they are going to admit from committing to other schools is sending out ‘likely letters’. If you get a likely letter from a college, that means barring any huge circumstances (they find out you lied on your application, you get arrested, your grades drop significantly, etc), you’re in. I got a likely letter from Columbia, my dream school.

I’m still keeping up all my extracurricular activities until I officially get admitted just to be safe. However, after I get my letter of acceptance, there’s nothing stopping me from letting loose a bit— colleges don’t care if you slack off a little bit, so they won’t rescind you unless you start failing all your classes, which I’m not planning to. Basically, I’m planning on quitting all of my leadership positions (student body president, president of the debate team, NHS president, captain of the track team) and stopping my participation in any clubs I’m in, so I can focus only on a) keeping my grades up to a respectable level and b) having fun with my friends.

I don’t see this as a bad or immoral thing at all— in fact, I see this as a really good thing for everyone, for a few reasons. 1) Even if I keep my leadership positions, my mind and heart wouldn’t be into them. My mindset right now is less ‘how do I run this club properly’ and more ‘how can I have as much fun as possible before going off to college’. With that mindset, I would no longer be a good leader. So, quitting saves my clubs from being run poorly by me 2) I’m giving juniors the chance to lead. They’re going to be in charge next year anyways, so if I quit and they’re in charge, they’ll get good practice for next year. 3) I personally won’t have to worry about balancing everything and can spend my time with my friends, with whom I’ll likely never get the chance to hang out with on a daily basis again.

However, some people I know think I’m being selfish by quitting all of my leadership positions.

A childhood friend of mine is getting married thanksgiving weekend, and I'm in the bridal party. I live a few states away  (WA to CA) so I need to fly in for the wedding, I've been asking the bride and the MoH what the plan is for the rehearsal dinner/day before the wedding is so I can make sure my flight gets there early enough so I can help out and attend everything. 

As of last week the bride said they were still figuring out what their plan was, and ticket prices were starting to rise, so I went ahead and bought my flights, I decided to book a flight that got in before 11a, figuring I'd have plenty of time to get to the venue and set up for a few hours before the rehearsal. 

This morning the bride sent a note to the bridesmaid group chat that they've decided to do a rehearsal breakfast at her parents at 10a, the airport is about 30 min from the venue, her parents house is an hour and a half in the other direction (which would be a very expensive uber...). I replied that my flight got in later and I would have to miss the rehearsal, but would meet them at the venue after to help with set up like we'd already planned. 

5 min after that the MoH texted me that the bride was upset, and that I would have to change my flight to either get there Thursday night (skipping thanksgiving with my own family) or fly in even earlier Friday morning. The change fee alone for this would be $125+ in addition to the fees associated with the new fare.

She read it and thanked me the next morning and seemed like she was feeling better. I was hanging out with one of our mutual friends Tim today and he was telling me that he saw Trisha recently.

0,"AITA for not cleaning the litterbox? | Backstory: My husband is a cat person. I am not. Think of it like the type of childfree people who like kids but don't want any - I like cats, but I don't want to own cats. I have lived with them before and it's not for me. So, of course, I fell in love with and married a cat guy. I made it clear from day one that I would not stop him from owning a cat, but I will not handle the litterbox. I have a dog, and I am 100% responsible for taking her out, feeding her, walking her, picking up the yard poop, etc. It seemed fair to me that I don't do the litterbox. I am generally disgusted with a litterbox in the house at all, but at the very least I do not want to be the one who deals with cleaning it. 

So, predictably, my husband does NOT keep up with the litterbox appropriately. The cat urinates on my things, pulls laundry out of the basket to pee on or cover poop with, even. He is an incredibly finicky cat and the box needs to be kept up with very very well. I have raised this issue multiple times, at varying levels of calmness and anger, and my husband either says he'll get to it or gets angry and says I should be helping with it, because I like the cat. Yes, I like the cat, but this was not supposed to be my responsibility. I am a very clean person and it's to the point that I've actually considered just leaving because I can't handle much more of the grossness of a) a dirty box and b) my things ending up with cat pee and poop on them for the next 15-20 years. 

But part of me feels guilty, because the cat didn't ask for this, and it's not his fault that my husband is so irresponsible; he deserves a clean toilet, so to speak.

0,"WIBTA If I stopped initiating everything without telling anyone | In every single one of my friendships I have to be the one to initiate conversations and plan outings. Honestly I'm sick of it. It makes me feel uncared for because I have to do everything. For the past week I had plans with two friends to go see a movie today, we discussed the movie time and rides. 7 o'clock was the agreed upon time and they agreed to pick me up. Today however at 3:30 I texted the one who offered me a ride and asked what time she was going to arrive at my place. She didn't respond. I waited anout 10 minutes and then I called her, and it went straight to voicemail.

At 6:55 I decided they probably forget and tought they were supposed to meet me there. So I rush to the theater and purchase my ticket. I quickly look at the snack nd ticket queus to see neither of them. So I head to my movie and, while the lights are still on I look for them and once again I don't see either of them. I again text the one who was supposed to be my ride but to no avail. The movie starts so I turn off my phone and try to just enjoy the movie.

After the movie is finished I turn my phone back on to see no notifications. As of now it's been 6 hours and the only text I got was from one of them about an unrelated questions I had asked the day before. And honestly it's pretty tough. There were no excuses, warnings, or even apologies. For one thing it hurts but for another it got me thinking. No matter who it is I always have to start the conversation or plan things. Hell I have one friend who, when he doesn't flake out, always says that he never responds because I don't say anything that requires a response (even thought I ask him questions.) Quite frankly this is ridiculous.

So I plan on deleting all of my conversations, but not unfriending or blocking. This way all that happens is that I don't see the conversation and thus won't feel the need to try to initiate. But if someone texts me first and initiates I'll keep talking to them and initiate and not delete that conversation again. But for everyone who doesn't respond I won't try. 

On the one hand this feels like I'm trying to test my friends. But on the other hand it's not like I'm going to end my friendship but rather just not initiate. It doesn't seem like a punishment if no one tries anyways. Of course I'm not doing this with family or contacts that are work related it's strictly going to be friends. And I get everybody works differently and some people are more social in person or over the phone but they never try to hang out in person or even call.

1,"AITA for taking coworker’s place, keeping him out of projects | Our workplace recently signed on a high profile client and the VP assigned me on it. The client is really important and will make a big impact on my resume.

TBH I was surprised I was assigned because my colleague Joe did the research for pitching the client. Usually if you did the research you will be the one on the team.

I think I was assigned out of luck. VP did not know Joe did the research. Joe did the research for the GM, not the VP. VP had the decision power. I bumped into VP in the office the day he was deciding who to work on it. No big differences between Joe and I.  Everything about same, position, work load, competence, well liked, both want to move up, hard working. When Joe found out I was assigned, he did not say anything bad but I could tell in his reaction he was surprised. I felt bad for him.

I am in the position for some of this client’s projects I can get Joe to support working. The VP lets me decide. If I want to have Joe work on it, I can. I know Joe wants to work on it. When chatting at the office, Joe frequently asks about the client, what they are like, bring up things he remember from his research.

I decided not to have Joe. I asked a coworker more junior to work on the projects. For the skills required for project, it doesn’t matter who does it.

Joe is a little more social than me and some clients like that personality more. Joe is probably a better fit for the client. I am afraid if Joe is working on it I will be slowly phased out.

0,"AITA for asking a group if I could sit in their “bag chair”? | This happened a few years ago, but I just remembered it when I saw another post about bar seating on this sub.

I went to a bar by myself one night. When I got inside, I realized it was more crowded than I was expecting - the bar was full and there were people hanging out behind the bar standing around. I almost left because I really wanted a calmer place to hang out and have a drink, but I realized there weren’t many good options in the neighborhood so I decided to stay.

While I was ordering a drink, I noticed there was an empty chair at the bar - there were a few bags resting on it, but no one sitting there. There was a group of girls standing nearby, so I guessed that the bags belonged to them. I asked the nearest girl whether anyone was sitting in that seat and she said “no”. Then I asked, would you move your bag so I can sit down? And she said “no” again. I argued with her a little bit but it was clear she wasn’t going to budge so I dropped it. Luckily, another bar seat opened up after a few minutes so I got to sit down anyway.

I felt like it was rude of this group to take up a bar seat in a crowded bar just so they didn’t have to hold their bags. Standing is no big deal if you’re in a group, but it’s pretty awkward and uncomfortable if you’re alone (as I was). But I told a friend about it and she thought it was reasonable to claim a “bag chair”. After all, the bags would have been taking up some standing room if the group had held them - and the standing room was crowded too. So, who was in the right here? Was I an AH for asking them to move the bags? Were they AH’s for refusing to move the bags?

To be clear, I am not disabled and was perfectly physically capable of standing.",False,False

I told this to my brother, and we did make a bet. $100 to the person who was right.

1,"AITA for pointing out that my brother is doing a poor job at being a new uncle? | My brother and his partner live overseas, so we rarely get to interact face to face. Every other Christmas is about how often they make the trip here. I gave birth to my daughter three months ago. It was by no means an easy birth, not as tough as some but I was definitely emotionally and physically depleted for the first couple of months. I was (and am still) reeling from having lost my mom two months prior to that. 

Without my mom in my life, I have no close, local family who were equipped to come by and help us at all since the birth. What family members we do have, and our small community of friends, have all made sure to reach out, to wish us well, and to try to help out in ways that made sense from afar. An Uber Eats gift card, a package of diapers from Amazon, that kind of thing.  We also had a nice baby shower that my mom threw for us right before she passed that helped set us up with the things we needed.

My brother texts me occasionally, maybe once every week or two for a brief chat. But he never asks about my daughter, instead it's just casual stuff he is interested in that we have always talked about, like football. I probably asked him to FaceTime with us a dozen times so he could see her in real time, but he always puts it off. He hasn't sent any kind of token or gift for the baby. 

I don't expect him to visit, I know that travel is tough for someone with his job and is expensive, and he was just here for our mom's funeral. But I feel like doing something to mark that he has a new relative, his closest living relative besides myself, would be kind of the normal and appropriate thing to do.

So the other day after getting rejected again for a video chat request I just asked point blank if there was something wrong with him, because it seemed like he didn't care much about the fact that he's an uncle now. He tried to play it off but when I pointed out that he could have at least sent a token gift for his niece he seized on that and made it seem like I was being materialistic. I really don't care if he spends a dime on her, I just want to give him some way to show that he cares more than an Instagram like's worth about my family, about me, about her.

Am I the asshole for calling out his lack of interest and action here? Or maybe for having those unmet expectations in the first place?",False,False

1,"AITA For getting upset at my parents and snapping at my mom when they refused me the flight lessons I earned? | Recently I won a $4000 scholarship to take flight lessons. To get the scholarship I had to submit a community service form (80 hours), a five paragraph essay, and an hour long interview. I am one of the three that won. Over three thousand people applied. 

However, the new semester has started in school and I have been so focused on getting this scholarship that school slipped. My grades dropped severely at the beginning of this quarter and the ending of last. I will admit I put the scholarship before school and sometimes did not have time for homework. I still passed my classes last semester with nothing lower than a high D in one class. On top of that I have been extremely stressed out about the scholarship, family health, and some troubles with my friends. 

Last semester my mom and dad both got very angry at me about my grades since they have never been so low. I was upset at myself but, I didn't know how to fix it and the hole just kep't getting deeper until the last two weeks when I was able to pull it all together. I worked my Christmas break away getting most of the remaining service hours and revising the final essay. 

I had my interview last week and found out I got the scholarship Tuesday afternoon. I was extremely excited and couldn't wait to tell my parents when they got home. When my mom and dad got home i knew something was wrong and when I asked them what it was they started about my grades. Both of my parents are reasonable people and very nice however my mom is not good at seeing other points of view and she overreacts some of time. A little ways into them scolding me about my grades my mom said something like ""I don't know what else you have been doing!"" And that is when I really got upset because she knew that I had been working on this for months now. I responded ""I've been working my ass off getting a scholarship! Which I was going to tell you about but, apparently that doesn't mean anything to you!"" Both my mom and dad were then temporily off the topic of my grades and we discussed my scholarship.

I don't remember how it started back up again but, my mom started getting really angry and started actually yelling about my grades. She kep't saying that I wasn't doing my part in the family and that she didn't think that I was responsible enough to use my scholarship money and said that there would be no lessons until semester ended because I had to stop acting like i didnt care about anything and told me at this rate I would be stuck working at McDonald's. I couldn't believe it and I was furious because the money is void by the end of the year. If I was not able to fly until summer I would miss out on flying until next school year becasue I had planned to work at a Boy scout camp during the summer to fund my flying lessons. If I didn't start now there is a big chance that I would not be able to use all my money as i would only be able to do one or two lessons per week and I couldn't do much flying in November or December as it is very snowy in those months where I live. I would only be able to take half of the projected lessons. 

Without thinking I just yelled ""What do you want me to end up in a dead end job like you!"" I immediatly regreted saying that and my mom just stopped and went to her room. I coulnt believe that I said that and I basically spent the rest of my night just crying in my room. My mom is very upset still and so am I. 

I really feel like a total douchbag but, i just don't know if it was appropriate of my mom to basically tell me I was a burnout and that I wouldn't amount to anything. Am I The Asshole?

TLDR: I earned a scholarship of $4000 for flying lessons but, somewhat neglected school while working on the scholarship. Now my parents are not letting me use my scholarship because of my grades and both my mom and I really hurt each others feelings during an argument about it.

0,"AITA for ditching a homeless woman and retracting my offer to buy her something? | This happened while I was on lunch on a warmer day a few weeks back. I had gone for a walk and was listening to music when someone tapped my shoulder. In honest, the smell hit me first. It was a larger lady. Her clothes did seem a bit mismatched, but actually in decent condition. I didn't hear what she said at first, she must not have seen my headphones (the big over ear ones) so removed them. She then proceeds to ask for money, standard beggar routine to which I almost never carry cash, let alone any change and told her I had none. Now, I wear a suit daily, I get paid well, but I have 2 kids at home so I don't throw money around. But if I can, I will buy a homeless person something to eat or drink. I prefer to offer but this one woman was very brazen and asked if I would be willing to buy her a drink because she was diabetic. I said sure as there was a coffee shop 2 blocks away on the way to my office.  Here's where things started to turn. She asked for an XL tea from a place in a different direction 3 blocks away, plus a bottle of over priced water, plus a cookie and a sandwich. And on top of that, she wanted me to go, get it and come back because she had found a bench to sit on and had peed herself. At this point my generosity has been far surpassed so I went one block in the direction she expected and then turned and headed to my office and went back to work. So, AITA for ditching this woman who turned out to be a choosing beggar?

1,"AITA for going to the beach with my ex-boyfriend without notifying my current boyfriend first? | My ex-boyfriend from high school and I broke up on good terms. He was in my city for 4 days to meet some friends and he thought of hitting me up as well today for a late lunch. I had finished my classes for the day but my boyfriend isn’t done until the evening. I texted my boyfriend of 8 months to ask him if I can have lunch with my ex-boyfriend and he said okay. He’s single at the moment. 


He picked me up and we went to a lunch spot by the beach. We had a blast catching up and while I insisted on splitting the bill, his insistence to pay for me was stronger so I gave in. We walked on the promenade and played some games on the pier. He won a stuffed animal and gave it to me. 


After that, he suggested we go lay on the sand on the beach. I didn’t think much of it since I’m not going to be in a bikini anyway. It’s 80 degrees so I just kept my tank top on. He went shirtless. No biggie, he’s just a little buffer than when he was in high school. But it still didn’t spark that attraction into overdrive. We just laid there and talked. 


I made an Instagram story of me and him on the beach. My boyfriend called me not even 10 minutes later asking me wtf I’m doing. I told him that we’re just on the beach doing nothing really. He started to curse me out so I told him I’m handing the phone over to my ex-boyfriend to explain. 


My ex-boyfriend said he’s just hanging out with an old friend he hasn’t seen for over an year. He asked my boyfriend if he would like to have dinner, just the 3 of us, to clear the air and show him that he’s a good guy. Apparently, my boyfriend said fuck no and hung up. I apologized to my ex-boyfriend for getting him into this situation and for my boyfriend’s behavior. 


He has never had a girlfriend before so he’s probably ultra-protective of me, though he doesn’t mind me hanging out with the few guy friends I have, and I don’t mind him hanging out with the few girl friends he has. My ex-boyfriend stayed cool throughout this. He drove me back and we hugged goodbye. I texted my boyfriend to arrange a dinner plan and talk things over and he accepted.",False,False
0,"AITA for being so upset with my bridesmaids behaviour on my wedding day? | Throwaway.

I got married two weekends ago. I asked my three best friends Anna, Kelly and Laura to be my bridesmaids 2 years before the wedding and found them very helpful when planning.

For the morning of my wedding I hired a fancy penthouse apartment for myself and the bridesmaids to get ready. We had champagne and as we were pouring it out, Laura said none for her. Now Laura is the biggest party animal of us all so naturally we questioned why she wasn’t drinking. Laura then told us she was pregnant. 

Of course I was happy for her but obviously the focus was then on Laura and her pregnancy and not us getting ready for my wedding, something I had been planning for 2 years. 

Anyway. We all got ready and headed to the venue. The photographer kept us outside the venue for a short while so he could do posed photos with myself and the bridesmaids. I was holding my bouquet, Anna and Kelly were holding theirs but Laura placed hers on the floor and was standing with her hands cradling her stomach as if to emphasise her bump (which wasn’t noticeable as she’s barely 12 weeks). The photographer asked her to pick her flowers up so all of us were holding our bouquets and Laura refused and said “oh it’s ok I’d prefer to stand like this” and carried on cradling her stomach. So now those photos just look weird.

The rest of the day went smoothly until it came to the speeches. As Laura was my oldest friend naturally I asked her to say a few words. She stood up and said some nice words, then ended her speech with “and I’m so excited to announce that as Bride’s best friend, I’d like her to be an honorary aunt to my baby who is due summer 2020!”. With her being an old family friend of course my family were over the moon and again the attention was on her and her pregnancy and not me and my husband. 

I felt so upset on my wedding day and haven’t really spoke to Laura much since. She has since sent me a text saying I’m acting like a spoiled brat and the world doesn’t revolve around me.

Then, M started talking about someone she knows and the fertility struggles that she’s having, saying things about her “geriatric eggs” and how risky it all is at her age. Then, M grew wistful about how it was probably too late for her to have babies. For context, I’m older than any of them and have badly wanted a child for years, and fear it’s too late for me, which makes me super sad. B knows this. I said something abrupt like “this subject isn’t a good one for me” and tried to shift the subject to B’s new life in the town she moved to. I could see that B looked concerned and M was upset, so I then said something like, “Did I offend you? That wasn’t my intention.” At this point, M was tearful, and said she was trying to open up and didn’t like being told to “shut up” and was going home because I made her very uncomfortable, and stormed off.

Currently it's only me and my brother at home, my little sister who's one year younger is abroad at the moment, and my two other older siblings. Both over 20, live in other countries.

He told me a few weeks before hand that he would invite 5 people, on a certain day. Which I was okay with, as long as they kept to the top floor. We live in a large house, the upper floor is his main ground where there's 3 guestrooms, his room, and a spacious living room.

I decide to go and sleep, and use my parents bed as it's much larger than my own, and more comfortable. I sleep until 11 pm when I wake up because they started playing loud music, people screaming. I step out of the bedroom and there's a lot more than 5 people, around 40 to say the least. We have a lot of expensive things around the house, which we're really careful off. I spoke to my brother in private, and told him he must make them all leave now. He refused and said that I should just keep to myself, and fuck off. He was quite drunk, I lost it.

My brother tried to intervene, but he didn't really succeed, after a couple of minutes everyone except the 2 people were gone. Who were both close family friends.

1,"AITA for not wanting to continue to play ""Catan"" after I realized I have no chance of winning? | On mobile, formatting is hard. 

So this happened tonight (we are in Germany) and the argument between my boyfriend and I just started off again and we need to settle it. I think you need to understand the game in order to judge, but maybe I am wrong. And I know, I know basically this argument is super childish. But sometimes grown ups argue over the most stupid things. 

Here is what happened: me, my boyfriend and a friend decided to play the boardgame ""The settlers of Catan"". After a few rounds all I could build was a road, while the other two had a couple of settlements and towns. I only collected about 4 or 5 resource cards while the other two were having so much more. My friend was on his way to build a settlement at the only place were I could have built one (and he would have made it before I had the chance, because I was still missing half the necessary cards and he was having a handful) and on the other side I was basically trapped by all the other roads, settlements and towns of my boyfriend and my friend. So nowhere else to go for me. 
After my friend placed the robber on one of my terrain tiles, even though I was so far behind and I only had 5 cards while my boyfriend had more I just snapped. I had zero chance of winning anyway so I got pissed and threw my cards on the table and said that I didn't want to play anymore.

They got super pissed at me and said I should continue and it is a super shitty thing to just quit. I told them that I have no possibility of winning anyway and they only want me to continue and basically force me to watch me get crushed by them even further because they were doing so good.

Another thing is that they could have easily continued without me. Normally you can only play it with 3 or 4 people. But they invented a version were you can play it with 2 people. They played this version two days before a couple of times and enjoyed it. So all they had to do was to put my stuff away from the board and continue. It would have made no difference for them if I stayed or left. But they stopped too, blamed me, were pissed and told me that ""you just don't stop when playing a board game"".

I gave her my card, gave her a budget and left it at that.

I checked my account later that day and realized she had spent way over budget. I went to talk to her and she admitted that she had not only gone over budget for herself, but she also bought outfits for her friends. She said “Dad has a new job, we can afford it.” She then said they planned to do it because we were making her move. I was blown away by the entitlement, took the new outfit away and then went to one friend’s house, explained what happened. They said they were going to give it back anyhow because they didn’t feel comfortable accepting expensive clothes from us. 

I go to the second girl’s house (I had called them ahead of time, mind you, I didn’t ambush them) and they gave me the clothes but said they found this to be very rude.

Whenever any sort of money comes into my possession, it's automatically hers by default. My first job, every check went to her and I kept some of my tips. 

Recently I've discovered that she's been periodically taking money from my bank account and putting it into hers without my permission. I'm not sure exactly how much she's taken. 

Last year she filed my taxes and told me I got $500 in returns. It came out that I actually received $1000 and she kept half of it. I had no knowledge of this. 

This year, I'm supposed to be getting around $3000 which I want to put towards a car. As soon as she knew I was getting a return, her first response was ""Oh good, I'll have some money now!""

0,"AITA for agreeing with my friend's ex? | So a friend of mine, Hailey decided to pull an april's fool prank on her boyfriend, Jet, by pretending to be pregnant. According to Hailey, Jet looked so shocked but was happy with his faith to be a young-ish dad. So when Hailey revealed it was a joke, Jet dumped her saying it was emotionally manipulative.

Hailey comes complaining our zoom video call with our other friends. Most were already walking on eggshells, as I noticed no one found her april fool's prank funny but was still comforting her. I decided to be quiet until she asked me my opinion.

I told her Jet was right to leave her straight up. She looked at me blankly and left the video chat. My friends said I was harsh but didn't disagree with me and now she's texting me saying I should've had her back.

1,"AITA for not wanting stepdaughter at new baby sonogram? | Wrestling with this one.

Wife (33f) and I (31m) are expecting our fist baby together. We each brought a daughter into the marriage. Stepdaughter is 9 and my bio daughter is 6.

I love my stepdaughter to death but she loves attention, wants to know everything and we butt heads from time to time because she treats her step sister (my daughter) like shit quite often and my wife doesn’t seem to mind it. In fact, wife doesn’t let me be her father unless it’s fun or not serious. Outside of that, I have no say.

We have our 20 week sonogram tomorrow where we find out the gender of the baby. I couldn’t be more excited. Wife tells a friend of mine that step daughter will be there since she’s out of school tomorrow. (My bio daughter will be at school.) I was unaware of this and quite frankly don’t want her there for a few reasons. 1) Wife didn’t talk to me about this at all. 2) I want this to be special for just us. 3) She’ll taunt my bio daughter that “she knew before her.” kinda deal.

1,"AITA for thinking my Mother has set a really high rent for living at home | I’ve just moved back home and the long and short of it is the fact that I’m earning more than my parents combined which means that my mother expects me to pay to live at home, a reasonable request which I myself suggested but she has jumped on the opportunity and set a large weekly rent. 

The weekly rate of $180 NZD would cover a basic rent, food, power and internet, as well as insurance for my car. The final piece of it is $30 for herself for doing my washing etc

I agree that I should be paying for all of this but I find the amount she has set as exceedingly high.

1,"WIBTA if I forced my son to play sports or some other extracurricular? | I’ve been seriously contemplating forcing my 13 year old to play sports. Not because I want to force my dreams on him or something of the sort, but because he is incredibly LAZY to the point it internally frustrates me. He gets straight C’s in MIDDLE SCHOOL, gets in trouble for talking in class all the time, doesn’t clean up after himself ever (will literally eat his food and just leave it sitting there either downstairs or in his room for DAYS!!) , and generally speaking does absolutely nothing but sit around the house playing games. He doesn’t even shower unless told (will walk around the house with the same clothes on for a week during breaks). He’s one of those people that would rather be comfortable doing nothing and being stagnant in life, than leaving his comfort zone and being productive. Basically he doesn’t do anything he doesn’t want to do unless he absolutely has to. 

His mother, who I have shared visitation with, is in my opinion an absolutely terrible parent. She doesn’t push him to do anything. She just enables this sort of behavior by cleaning up after his messes, and barely punishing him for anything. I fear he’s shaping up to be a loser. I’ve been thinking of taking the initiative by forcing him to be apart of some team oriented extracurricular activity in order to snap these terrible bad habits, and complete lack of a work ethic. 

Something tells me being around friends of similar age all working really hard towards something and having fun in the process would give him the jolt he needs. My current thinking is telling him he has to play basketball for 1 season and if he doesn’t like it he can quit after the season is over. Would that make me an asshole?

0,"AITA for letting my 6 year old son occasionally shower with me? | My ex wife and I have been separated for about 2 years and share custody of our 6yo son. We are on the same page for pretty much all parenting decisions, and we coparent very well and get along pretty well.

When I (34m) have my son on work/school days, sometimes the only way to get him out of bed, woken up properly, and washed is to just have him jump in the shower with me. I usually help him shampoo his hair, but he does all the other washing himself. Then I let him sit in there for a few minutes while I get dressed.

This kind of thing is fairly normal to me as i grew up with both parents, a sister, and one bathroom when i was a kid. My mom amd sister would have a block of bathroom time in the morning, then my dad and I got our shot. So being around my naked dad as a kid was no big deal, and I guess i carried that feeling into raising my son.

But my son's mom has an issue with not only showering together but us both being nude around each other while we get ready. She thinks it is weird. I do understand that he is probably getting too old to bathe together all the time, but more so bc I want him to become more self sufficient, and not bc of the nudity. 

To be clear,  I respect my ex's wishes, and we promised each other we wouldn't undermine each other's parenting. So we did stop showering together.  But I still don't necessarily think it is a huge deal. So I need to know- am I being creepy with my son in the shower? Did i grow up in a weird household?

0,"AITA for telling one of my little gymnasts she can't stay anymore? | I teach gymnastics 3 times a week, so my gymnasts train 6 hours a week and they are 7-11 years old. It's nowhere near elite, I think it's 3 levels lower (out of 6) but they are training for competitions. 

Two years ago, a new girl came to my group. She was actually scouted for elite level, but didn't like training there. The first year she was part of our group, she won literally every competition. I thought it would be good for her motivation and confidence, although during trainings she didn't work as hard as the other, less talented girls. At the end of last season we gave her a choice: a) staying at the same level but no preferential treatment anymore (she could only train elements that were part of our level) or b) leaving our group to go one level higher and learn more difficult and challenging stuff. 

She chose to stay with us. Even though I advised her (and her parents) to level up. As expected, this season she's won every competition so far and I can't think of anything to teach her anymore. In addition, I think it's not fair to the other super hard-working girls in our group. 

That's why I sat down with her and her mother and told her that we wanted her to level up and can't stay another season. She could however decide for herself if she wanted to go 1 or 2 levels up. I told her it's because she's too talented to stay in our group and we can't teach her anything new anymore and it's not fair to our other gymnasts if she stays another season. 

She was super flattered and happy because she wanted to learn more challenging stuff and saw it as a chance to get better, but her mother was mad at me for leaving them no choice and feels like I force them into things.

1,"AITA for not taking my husband's dog to the vet? | My husband and I have 3 kids together 9M, 3F & a 2 month old male.

About a week before our baby turned a month old my husband got a call from a friend that his dog had puppies and he was looking to find a home for them & asked him if he was interested in any. My husband asked what breed were the dogs (pitbull & bulldog mix) and how old they were (5 months). My husband has ALWAYS wanted a pitbull or bulldog.

 Husband asked me if I was okay with him bringing a dog home. I told him it was up to him whatever he decided to do. I made it very clear to him that if he decided to bring a dog home, that it was his responsibility at all times. I told him he was going to be the one to do everything for the dog. He agreed. He brought a dog home.  He asked me the favor of taking the dog out during the day while he was at work. I hesitantly agreed.

 The dog of course gives me trouble. He pulls on the leash and doesn't want to do his business outside. I'm having a hard time not getting upset because when the hell did I decide to sign up for this.

Anyways, I ask my husband when is he taking the dog to the vet because he needs his shots and I don't want an unvaccinated dog near our kids. He asks me If I can take him. I say no & proceed to tell him I was already doing him too much of a favor by taking the dog out during the day while he's at work. He says okay.

 Well, our baby is now 2 1/2 months old and my husband has not taken the dog to the vet yet. We find out the dog has worms because you can see them in his poop. I once again tell him he needs to take his dog to the vet and he once again asks me to take him. I explained that he needs to understand that his dog is not leash trained, he pulls himself everytime I take him outside, and I'm not going to be looking like an idiot out in public with a baby, 4 year old, 9 year old and an untrained dog pulling on his leash, just to do him the favor of taking him to the vet. He said that I'm being a jerk because I know that he doesn't have a set work schedule. I tell him it's not my problem and he should've thought about that before he brought the dog home. He doesn't say anything after that and that's that.

 Today I saw my kids playing with the dog and they were letting him lick them. I tell them to stop letting the dog lick them because the dog has worms and I've seen him licking his private parts and don't want them contracting anything. Especially because the 4 yr old has the habit of putting her hands in her mouth constantly. My husband hears this, gets mad, puts the dog in his kennel and just snaps. He yells at me that he will just let the dog run away and that I'm an asshole for not taking the dog to the vet when he has asked me nicely multiple times to do so. I just look at him and tell him he can do whatever he wants to do with the dog, I'm still not taking him to the vet.

0,"WIBTA for taking away my daughters “nice” clothes | We created this account just to ask this question, both sides will be told-ish

Wife and I have been married for 15 years, we have been gifted with one daughter and two sons during this time, daughter who we’ll call Kayla which is a fake name is 12, wife’s name is Kathrine (fake name) and I am called Tony (fake name) 

We recently got a phone call from Kaylas school to tell us she’s been picking on one of the ‘less fortunate’ children over the clothes they were wearing. Kayla herself is always wearing the best brands something I saw no issue in as her mother enjoyed buying them for her and our sons, when she got home she seemed smug which genuinely baffled me as we didn’t raise her like this? I’ve told her that I’m not amused and if she’s going to use clothes and our money as a way to feel superior she won’t have it.

I’ve told her she can go to the charity shop and pick up what she can to make do and then she can donate her clothes to the less fortunate as she likes to mock them, wife agreed in front of the daughter but as soon as our daughter was out of site she told me she thought it was a “d-ck move” as she’s only a child. 

My side of things is that maybe we’ve gone too lenient on her and we genuinely need to be concerned about this behaviour- aside from the punishment I want to get her therapy due to this as she clearly has emotional issues (from where? Idk but at least we’ll be able to find out and help her)

Wife’s side is that all children lash out one way or another, grounding her is one thing but this’ll completely ruin her self esteem and her social life at school, maybe we should find another suitable punishment but this isn’t suitable for a child discovering themselves

In a mix of self-loathing and deflection, I used the term ""fatty"" a lot.  I called myself that a lot usually a joking-not joking manner.  Like I said, self-loathing.  I don't call specific individuals ""fatty"" but will say things like ""Back when I was a fatty..."" or ""You don't know the fatty mentality!""  Most of my friends saw how rotund I was and saw the slimming, so no one has ever told me I couldn't say it anymore.   The AITA situation happened last week with a friend of a friend.  I was cooing over my friend's cat called him a little fatty while rubbing his chubby belly.  Friend of a friend heard that and told me ""That's so offensive.""  I was initially confused... maybe she had an issue with me touching the cat's belly.   Some cats don't like that!  But no, turns out she took offense to ""fatty"".  I explained that it's an old habit, and she response that since I'm no longer fat, I can't say it anymore.

He followed my coworker back to the host stand and dominantly put his hand on her shoulder tightly and stood hovering over her while asking if he could be seated elsewhere. 

Now I can be quite hypervigilant but the interaction felt very wrong from a stranger. I told him that we could discuss the seating without him touching my coworker. He seemed almost annoyed by my comment. When things were settled, he was gone and I asked my coworker if I overstepped or was wrong for saying that.

I thought I was standing up for her. AITA?

I assume it's a well known fact that a lot of Jewish people have curly, unruly hair.

0,"AITA for not getting permission from my daughters dad before cutting her hair? | My daughter (12 years old) has been begging me to let her cut her hair short for close to a year. She has autism coupled with a pretty severe sensory disorder that makes her very uncomfortable when her head is touched. She won’t wear anything in her hair, no hats, and won’t even wear it in a pony tail. 

For Christmas this year she wanted to get it cut short. I wasn’t a fan of the idea but she was excited and seemed very sure about it so I took her to get it done. She’s over the MOON about it and loves it.  She hasn’t stopped playing with it and looking at it. 

She sent pics to the family because she was excited to share it and everyone is freaking out. Her dad has been texting me constantly and he is absolutely furious that I let her cut her hair so short at this age and is mad that she “looks like a boy”. He says she’s not old enough to make such a big decision and we should made this decision together as her parents. 

Did I do something wrong here? I’m very outnumbered as he’s not the only one in my family that seems pretty upset by her hair. I feel like she’s old enough to make these choices for herself and I haven’t seen her so excited about something like this in a long time. 

Side note, I should probably mention that she’s been talking a lot lately about how she might be gay. A lot of the family is having a hard time with that (it’s not a problem with me at all) and I think some of the problem right now is that this is a “masculine” fashion choice and they think I’ve somehow pushed her in that direction by allowing her to take on a “boyish” look.",False,False

Me (15f) and my Grandmother (59f) had decided that tonight we were going to watch a movie, eat some popcorn, and play some monopoly, as we've done in the past. We encouraged my autistic brother (14m) to play with us as it could teach him things such as money, etc. He declined like usual and went into his room to play videogames, which was normal so we decided to start playing.

Midway into the game he decided to sit on his phone in the chair behind me (I was sitting on the floor instead of the chair so I could reach the game pieces). I wasn't that too fond of it because he doesn't know much about what and what not to do in front of people, but I didn't want to start an argument and just ignored it. 

Within 5 minutes he had banged the arm of the chair very loudly near my ear (his stimming), farted twice, and started picking his toenails all while my head, hair, and back were inches away. I was absolutely disgusted and asked multiple times in between each thing he did to make him move or have my grandmother sit in my place instead, because it was disgusting and I didn't want to smell or have nail clippings on my damn back. My grandmother laughed and thought I was joking and that it's not that big of a deal. 

She ended up telling him to stop but within a minute I could hear him picking his nails again so I just got up and left.

1,"AITA for stealing my deceased grandma's lamp and refusing to fess up? | Background: I (28F) am the oldest of myself and my 7 sisters (we'll call them Jill, Mary, Ruth, Elle, Jane, Nora, Kylie), but all of us are roughly a year apart. Our mom died when I was young, our dad left, and we were raised by our grandmother. A year ago, she was diagnosed with cancer and Mary moved back in to care for her. 

Two weeks ago, she passed away. Mary had called me a few days beforehand to say that she was in decline, so I took a leave of absence from work and returned home. When she died, I agreed to stay in the country to help plan the funeral and handle legalities with her estate.

In our grandma's will, her inheritance was divided very evenly. She had left the house to Mary, which we all agreed was more than fair. Although the house was Mary's, she left the divvying up of the furniture to my sisters and I. We agreed to go through the house and put post-it's with our name on it on the furniture we wanted. More than one post-it, we would duke it out amongst the two who wanted it. No post-its, it'd be sold at an estate sale. 

I live a fairly nomadic life, so I didn't want much. Since my sisters were claiming pretty much everything else, I decided the two things I wanted was a brooch and a small lamp. The lamp was first in my grandma's nursery, then my mom's, then Kylie and Nora's. 

By the time we had finished stickying everything we wanted, we realized that all 8 of us had claimed the lamp. I told my sisters that it was only fair that I take it, since I only wanted the two things, while the rest of them had essentially taken the whole house. Kylie felt that since it had been ""hers"" most recently, it should be hers, but Nora felt she had a similar claim. Jane didn't ""want much"" so she felt deserving of the lamp. Elle wanted it in lieu of a wedding gift from our grandma (who was too poor to buy her one), and Ruth wanted it as furnishing for her new place. Mary thought she deserved it for taking care of gran, and Jill felt it was fair that it go in \*her\* daughter's room. 

I told Kylie, who also wanted the brooch, that she could have it if I got the lamp. She refused. It dissolved into a huge spat, so I went outside to calm down. When I came back in, they had agreed to ""table the discussion."" We all went to go home, but I sat in my car for a minute and cried about the lamp. It was stupid to cry over, but I was feeling really upset in general at my gran's death and was furious that my sisters hadn't allowed me the one thing. I decided to get it anyways. I put my jacket in my backpack, told Mary I had left it upstairs, went into the bedroom, took out my jacket, put the lamp in it's place, and then went to my hotel without detection.

Today, when my sisters noticed it was gone, they went MENTAL. Nobody is speaking to each other. I'm trying to just keep the lamp secret until my flight home in a few days, but I'm scared I'm causing irreparable damage to my family. But I really just want this lamp.

He just let's it go, and doesn't care. I'm fed up. This has already cost us a shit ton of money that could have gone for other things and now he says it's his choice. Reddit, WIBTA if instead of toys and fun things for his birthday, buy him a year's supply of Pampers?

For context, it isn't the parenting that's causing this. We have tried everything we can think of. So much more than I can type here.

1,"WIBTA for reporting my neighbour's secret puppy to our landlord? | We live in an apartment in an old building which is split into several other units. 10 in total.

In the lease it says we are not meant to have any pets. We all have the same rules... recently a young couple (maybe mid 20s) moved into the ground floor apartment. They are renting their apartment through an agency.

Last weekend we saw them walking into the building carrying a small puppy and my husband says he has seen the woman walking it near our building on some mornings before work.

We spoke to another neighbour about it who told us that he bumped into them in the hallway with it too, and the girl said it was her parent's new puppy who she was looking after for now because their other older dogs don't like it or something and they need to ""figure things out"". This sounds like BS to me.

We haven't heard it bark yet but I'm sure that will start once it grows bigger. Also I'm not sure how they plan on hiding it from any landlord visits or even if they are leaving it alone during the day when the work. Before it causes any problems for us and the other neighbours, it seems like a good idea to report it.

0,"AITA for snapping at my friend who said he can't handle losing his dog, after doing nothing for days when his dog showed signs of being sick? | As the title says. About two weeks ago my friend J mentioned in one of our chats that his puppy seemed sad, was not moving a lot and has darker stool. I told him to bring the puppy to his vet because it might be sick with ehrlichia, I know that disease because our dogs have had it in the past. He said he will try to find time to bring his dog to the vet.

J comes from a rich family and works for his dad in their family business. Money is no object and it should be easy to just ask his dad for half a day off to bring his puppy to the vet. But for some reason he did not.

Yesterday he started posting on Facebook that his dog is seriously sick and is confined in an animal hospital for treatment, with pictures of the dog lying down hooked to an IV. Our friends comforted him and he replied with thanks, then talked about how much he loves his dog and hopes he will get better soon. I was irritated because I think that if you really love your pet, and money and time aren't a problem, you would bring them to your vet within days of noticing that they are not well and not wait for them to get seriously sick. I also thought he was using his dog's sickness for attention, but I didn't say anything.

Then J messaged me personally and asked if I'd seen his Facebook post. I said yes. He said he is really depressed and doesn't think he can handle losing his dog. At this point I snapped. I told him how could he say that he can't handle losing his dog if he didn't do anything for weeks after noticing that it was not well? I reminded him that I said he should bring his dog to the vet immediately, yet he didn't do anything for weeks. Is that how you treat something that you can't handle losing?

He was surprised at my reaction and became defensive. He said that if I was in his situation he would be comforting me and not scolding me. I didn't reply anymore but in my head I was thinking, no, I will never be in your situation because I bring my dogs to the vet when I see that they're not well. I would've understood if he was broke or had a job he couldn't get time off from. I would even have understood if he said he didn't think the sickness would be serious. Just don't say that you can't handle losing something if you're not willing to take care of it in the first place.",False,False
0,"AITA for taking back the laptop that I bought for my Nephew because he wasn't appreciative? |   

  

Bit of back story - my brother has four kids, the oldest of which is starting high school next year and he needs a laptop for his classes. Bro and his GF don’t have a lot of money and they were really stressing about buying him a new laptop. I’m much better off financially than them, so I said that I’d buy him the laptop for his birthday. So I went out and bought him a Lenovo ideaPad for about $1600 - not top-of-the-line, but certainly more than enough for what he needed.

So Friday was his birthday and we all went to their place for dinner and the kid was basically vibrating out of his seat with excitement over his new laptop. First chance he gets he rips into it and immediately his face just drops.

“Oh, a Lenovo”

“Something wrong?” I ask

“It’s just - ya know - not a very good brand”

“Oh, alright”

He then moves onto his other presents - without saying thank you - and I just sat there completely dumbfounded. He’s usually a good kid, which is exactly why I thought he deserved it in the first place. So this completely threw me but I decided to let it go for now because I didn’t want to ruin his birthday. 

But he kept making these little backhanded remarks, like when he was finished opening his presents, he plugged in the laptop and started to set it up. Now, obviously, it’s a brand-new laptop booting up for the first time, so it’s taking a while.

My mum says “How’s the laptop, \[Name\]”

“Yeah, it’s booting up ... extremely slowly”

So after 3 or 4 of these little jibes, I snapped and just took it from him.

I said -

“If you’re going to be an ungrateful little shit, then you get nothing.”

And I put it back in the box, apologised to Bro and GF for making a scene, and left.

So now it’s 3 days later and I’m wondering if maybe I could have handled the situation a little better. Bro and GF completely support my position and are mortified by his behaviour, but my parents think I’m being too harsh.

I’m completely torn. On the one hand, he did act like a little entitled brat and I think he should be punished for his behaviour. He refuses to apologise because he thinks I’m the asshole who ruined his birthday. I must say that not only am I angry that he wasn’t more grateful, I’m actually quite hurt that I went out of my way to buy him an expensive gift that I thought he’d love and he completely snubbed it.

On the other hand, I feel bad for making a scene at dinner and calling him a ‘little shit’ (as I said, he’s usually quite a good kid). I also feel bad that his parents are now going to have to scrap and save to get him the laptop that he needs for school. I was thinking of maybe giving them the laptop. Then they could sell it, buy him a shittier one and pocket the rest of the money for themselves?

0,"AITA for reminding my fiancee to find her ring? | I don't know if this is too small stakes for this sub but it's been an issue in my immediate family and I want to know if I'm in the wrong.

I proposed seven months ago with a $4000 ring. About four months ago I noticed she stopped wearing her engagement ring and I asked her why. She said she didn't want to lose it so she keeps it in a jewellery box hidden away for special occasions. I didn't press further.

I found out a month ago that while this is technically true, she has told me she doesn't know where the jewellery box is. She doesn't have much jewellery so she told me it's literally just a ring box, not one of those bigger fixtures you might think when you think about jewellery boxes. She said she was actively looking for it.

A week ago it got to a heated discussion about the ring where I tell her I'm disappointed she's lost it. She tells me she did not in fact lose it, but misplaced it. To me, that means the same thing. She said she hasn't had time to look for it but knows she didn't lose it (???).

Now I bring it up every day, asking her if she found the ring. The answer is always no. She is getting mad at me and getting her parents to put pressure on me to drop it. She ""doesn't want to be reminded of it"". If I was in her shoes and I lost literally the most expensive thing I own, I'd be frantically looking for it, not taking this laissez-faire approach. I mean, I wouldn't have lost it anyways: I would have known where it is at any moment on any day. You don't just lose something that's $4000, right? The longer it takes for her to find it, the less likely she's going to find it, right?

I got on at the first stop, so it was empty when I got on. I put my bag down next to me as it was big and bulky. I put my headphones in and kind of zoned out, so I didn’t notice the train getting full until someone asked if I could move my bag so they could sit there. if i’d noticed the train getting full, i would have moved it so anyone could sit there. however, the first thing I noticed about this person is that they smelt very strongly of cigarettes smoke. I hate the smell and didn’t feel like being suffocated for the rest of my ride, so I said “i’m sorry I have asthma and cigarette smoke triggers it” this was a total lie, but again, I didn’t want to have to smell it. she looked angry and had to stand further up the car for her ride.

Myself and the group of friends were talking the other day whilst drinking and the conversation somehow got round to fanfiction, it's never been my thing so I wasn't really talking. Said girl however was very animated about it as it seems she writes her own and even draws pictures for it.

She must have been rather drunk as she ended up sending me a link to it out of the blue then deleted the message the next morning. I hadn't read it so still had the notification so decided to check it out. I didn't read much but what I did see was very very creepy. The main character is either me or heavily based off me and the drawings she does for each chapter are very clearly me in a gay relationship.

I was creeped out so dropped her a message and asked her if the character was me, she replied ""Yeh...do you like it?"", I replied that I didn't and found it very creepy. I asked her to stop involving me in her story and drawings, I got no reply to this.

I thought it was the end of this a few weeks later the subject was brought up again and I decided to check her profile out again. Lo and behold she's not stopped and has just continued. I was annoyed by this so just said in the video chat ""Hey, I asked you to stop write creepy fan fiction about me, why haven't you?"" and linked her story in the chat.

0,"AITA for keeping a secret from my brother about his daughter? | So I have a niece who is a sophomore in college.  I live fairly close to the campus, so when she started school as a freshman I told her that if she ever needed it, I’ll pick her up no questions asked and I wouldn’t tell her parents.  She hadn’t ever taken me up on the offer until last Friday when she called me around 1 in the morning saying she wanted me to pick her up from a party and asked if she could stay at my house.  I of course picked her up but when she got into my car it looked like she had been crying.  I asked if she was ok (yes) and if she wanted to talk about anything (no), so we drove back in silence. When we got back to my house she just went to sleep in the guest room.  She woke up the next morning and I took her to breakfast and drove her back to school without mention on the previous night.  

Well last night my wife and I had dinner with my brother and my SIL and they said that my niece seemed a little off when the saw her last weekend and asked if she mentioned anything to me since we’re very close.  I told them I hadn’t talked to her in a couple weeks and I’m sure that she’s fine, just stressed from school.  After dinner I texted my niece saying that her parents are worried about her, but I didn’t say anything about last weekend. 

My wife thinks I should have said something about what happened, but I said absolutely not and that it would completely ruin any trust between me and my niece.  The next time she needed something she may not call me and something bad could happen.  My wife said that something may have already happened and that by not asking her about it we won’t ever know what it is.

1,"AITA for not telling my son he’s diagnosed with aspergers? | DISCLAIMER: This is not actually my son and the “potential asshole” in question isn’t me. This is something I think about all the time, and I can’t figure out if it’s morally just for the mother to keep this from her son. Because Reddit has a lot of autistic/aspergers users, I want the community’s opinion on the situation from their side. 

My grandparents used to live next to a very kind family. They had a son about 19 years old. He was very shy, quiet and very nice. 

My grandmother told me that his mother confessed his specialists gave him an official aspergers diagnosis, but she had no intention of telling him, because she wanted him to live a “normal life” and not risk him using the diagnosis as an excuse to change that. 

Personally, when I got my own diagnoses (depression, bipolar II) around his age, I was somewhat relieved to know I wasn’t alone and had understanding as to why my brain wasn’t working right. It allowed me to develop a treatment plan and get back on course. Without that I’d probably be dead by now. 

I know her intentions are good and she’s trying to do what she thinks is best for her son. But I don’t know the future ramifications of her choice, how it would affect the guy in the future, if it’s fair to keep his mental condition secret from him...

Is she ultimately an asshole for doing this to (or for?) her son?",False,False

I am a tall white man (6'4"") and think that I look stereotypically ""American."" I'm big and broad and have blue eyes and I don't speak anything other than English. I was talking with a coworker who is Chinese-American (I know she was born in the US and obviously is American but she looks ethnically Chinese). 

I was talking to her about future travel plans and she mentioned she'd love to visit the Middle East. I'm just thinking about all the crazy stuff that happens there and told her that I would be too worried to go because I look ""American"" but it makes sense that she feels like she could go because she looks Chinese. She got really huffy and asked what I meant and I told her she could pass off as Chinese (she even speaks it!) whereas I don't look anything but American and I'd be scared for my life if I went. She then got even more pissed off and told me I don't get to dictate who looks American and who doesn't.

I drove him home just fine and I told him not to worry about gas money when he asked. He then asked when I go back to the college if i can pick him up on my way back. I said no problem. 

So while im home, i hit up my dealer for some weed. I buy only 3 grams since money is a little tight. I send a snap to my friend John and my other friends of me with the weed as a joke. The next day after i get the weed, I let John know im leaving and i’ll be there in 2 hours. He says okay sounds good.

 Im around 20 minutes away from his place sitting in traffic to get on the exit to get to him. He calls me and asks me if I had weed on me. I told him yes and he goes “yeahhh im just gonna have my mom drive me”’. I got upset because it seemed really rude to cancel like that. I was able to get out of the exit lane and get back on the highway towards home so it didnt affect my trip at all (he didnt know how close i was to him)

 My friend says i’m overreacting and it didnt even affect my trip but i said it was rude and inconsiderate and even if we did get pulled over and the cop somehow found the weed, he wouldnt get penalized whatsoever. I sorta cut John off over this.

She said he would let us know if we were being too loud. One of the kids was throwing repeated, screaming tantrums when he didn’t win, and the husband never said a word. Around the time that everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave, it became apparent that the host had had too much to drink, as she was emotional and then started throwing up. 

Here’s where the aita part comes in: The host’s kids (4 and 7) obviously needed to be taken care of (put to bed) before anyone felt comfortably leaving. Her husband was asleep and she was throwing up in the bathroom so I (31f mother of a 2 year old and former nanny) and another girl (25f, also former nanny) took the kids upstairs to put in pjs and attempt to put them to bed. As they were running around, trying to find their jammies, their father (the husband) woke up.

FYI, I don't text and drive. I assumed nobody else would be blowing up my phone at this time of night so I pulled over and read them but didn't respond to her.

She tried calling me after I ignored her barrage of texts, and since I was waiting for the food to arrive, I answered. She exploded at me for being so selfish, that I never considered what she wanted (which was what?). She asked for take-out and I was so pissed she was treating me like her chauffeur and deliveryman so I said, ""No, you had your chance"" and hung up on her (2nd potential asshole moment here).

1,"AITA for expecting a landscaping crew to take care of the mess/damage they made? | Yesterday I went to a local landscaping company and ordered 4 cubic yards of topsoil and compost. With delivery this cost $312. While I was there I spoke to the driver and asked him about delivery. I was trying to figure out where I should put my tarp to dump dirt. He said they usually just dump in the person's driveway, and asked me if I was wanting something different. I asked if it would be a problem to drive it to my garden site, as the dirt was meant to fill my raised garden beds. He said as long as it wasnt through standing water and through gates it should be fine. Note, my property isn't flat and level but the area to my garden bed is relatively easy to get to, through 1 acre of mowed pasture. 

This morning the dirt truck arrived and the driver that I spoke to was driving. From the road I showed him the location that I wanted him to dump on and ask him again if he thought that would be okay, if not, i'd move the tarp. He said it should be just fine, pretty much a straight shot. He unloads the dirt, and goes to drive away and he is stuck. It rained quite a bit this spring but we have been lucky enough the last week or so that it is dried out pretty well. No local flooding. Apparently 6 inches down in the yard was not dry enough. I offered him a couple of wooden boards to see if he could gain some traction, and he tried. To no avail. This was starting to put a few tire tracks in the yard. I was hoping they'd be minimal. The driver called his boss to come help out. At this point I had chores to do and went inside the house an acre and a half away, and asked him to call my phone if he needed anything. He said he would


His boss arrived in a F350, and chained the dump truck up to tow. Worked on the first try. As i was walking out the door to meet them, they drove off, without stopping, leaving clods of dirt along the road. I walked down to the garden site to see about 75-100ft of truck tracks, some 6 inches deep. The yard looked a lot worse than i'd imagined. What really upset me is that they just drove away without saying anything. Here are pictures and a short video of them getting out  http://imgur.com/gallery/9JTNwcQ

I have only facebook messaged the company so far, to send them photos of the damage, and have gotten no reply. Though, I have a feeling they may not be so sympathetic because they did just drive away from the tracks without a word. I'm definitely going to have to buy even MORE dirt to fill these dirt tracks and spend an afternoon packing truck tracks. So I'm covering my bases here. 

My husband thinks that this is my own fault because I was stupid and allowed a truck to dump dirt in the spring season because it rains. But if I had any idea this would have happened, i would have easily moved the tarp and had him dump from the road. I was taking the drivers word. So. Am i the asshole here?",False,False
0,"AITA for correcting one of church leader for making a joke out of my son's answer? |  

This just happened an hour ago.

We are attending a bible camp at this church, not the church I go but other one.

There are kids from Prek to 6th graders, like 150 kids, and my son is 8yr.

So the video of ""this bird"" playing and building a nest was shown.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoopoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoopoe)

So at the end of the video, MC asked, ""Wasn't that a pretty bird? I've never seen one. Does anyone know what this bird is called?"" Someone raised his hand, (I didn't look), MC walked over and gave the mike. The boy said ""Hoopoe"". I noticed it was my son's voice. Then the MC said ""What?? a Hippo? it looked nothing like a hippo."" Then everyone laughed. As MC walked away, I could hear him saying, ""No I said Hoop..."". I thought the lady probably didn't even know what that bird was.

My son would never ever make that kind of silly joke. So I googled ""a bird name Hoopo""(I've never even seen or heard of this bird called Hoopoe so I typed Hoopo"". Then, there it is, Hoopoe...

I personally thought joke wasn't funny at all. Kids do get offended when their knowledges are mocked or joked.

When everything was over, the pastor asked all the leaders to remain and debrief for 10mins.

Pastor said ""What a great night! any thoughts?""

I raised my hand and told both my kids to come to the front. On my phone, I had that wikipedia pic prepared.

I said ""Could you not ask a question when you don't even know the answer? \*looking at the MC who asked question and showing my phone. So this is what my son meant, Hoopoe, not hippo. If you knew the answer, you wouldn't have made the joke and made him feel embarrassed.""

The MC said ""oh...sorry, I knew what it was and just made a joke out of it.""

(I'm a dad by the way)

I said. ""you knew??""...\*brief pause\*...""Well, it wasn't funny...You are in children's ministry and you should know that.""

I told my wife about this as soon as I got home and she, (didn't tell me that I""m an ass\*\*), but definitely was an over-react, and didn't have to make that ""public"" and embarrassing the MC.

On my way home, I asked my son if the joke was funny and he said, ""uh...no. dumb.""

1,"AITA for trying to adopt my sister's baby? | Throwaway

I (29F) and my sister (19) Beth both got pregnant in June.

I found out when I got my family together to announce my own news and she interrupted me to announce she was pregnant first. Our family was so overjoyed at her news that it barely registered when I told them that I was having a baby, too. It bothered me tremendously as my husband and I have been trying unsuccessfully for 5 years and were so excited to have that moment... Just for our thunder to be stolen.

I miscarried in September. My sister (who has 2 mediocre part-time jobs, substandard housing, is in her first semester of community college and who I doubt actually knows who the father of her child is) is currently 6 months pregnant. 

I sat her down recently and explained to her that she is not fit to be a mother. I told her she was doing a disservice to her child by trying to raise it alone in a less than ideal situation. I explained that the baby would be much better off in a functional two parent home with a stable financial situation and that my husband and I would gladly raise her baby as our own.

She exploded at me and said many hurtful things, among which was that I only gave a fuck about her and her baby because I lost mine. She has since told our entire family what an evil monster I am and how I'm trying to take her baby away. My family has since given me the cold shoulder and I've been told that if I bring it up again, I won't be invited to the holiday events this year. 

I don't see it that way at all and am only trying to give everyone involved the best life possible. So, am I the asshole?",False,False
1,"AITA for not publicly thanking my parents for paying for flying my family and I to a family reunion? | So my family (wife and two kids) and I have been going through a very tight few months as I’m transitioning to a new career. We simply do not have any money for anything that isn’t food and bills. Dipping into our minimal savings to carry us to the first paycheck in the new job. 

My fathers side of the family was having a small reunion, of which I was unaware of. A few weeks ago he called me to chat and offered to fly us out to surprise everyone, knowing our current financial situation. We were very apprehensive because this was a big expense for anyone and we never even asked, but he insisted it would be amazing to see us and surprise the rest of the family so we agreed.

We fly out and have a great time. We stay with my aunt who is an amazingly generous person and offered her home to us so we wouldn’t have to pay for a hotel.

My wife posts on facebook (which is the bane of our existence) thanking my aunt for housing us and her mother for watching our dog. She did not publicly thank my parents for paying for our tickets, one, because it’s embarrassing to us and makes us feel uncomfortable to put that information out that we couldn’t pay for our trip. And two, we both personally thanked them IN PERSON at the reunion several times and I did again on the way to the airport for their generosity and how appreciated it was.

Now my father is calling me upset and saying my step mother is upset that Taylor thanked  these people in this stupid post except them.

1,"AITA for kicking down my enemy when she's already suffering? | So I (22M) graduated university last year. There was one girl (22F) who would always be a huge bitch to people, and she was bitchy to me. We will call her 'The Bitch'. Though mostly, it was through talking about me (and other people) behind our backs.

I knew from a mutual friend, that she would say shit like ''throwawayaloal is a weirdo'', ''throwawayaloal is weird, why do you (saying to my friend) hang out with him?'' etc, even ''throwawayaloal is a dumb shit'. 

So to my face she was civil but behind my back, not so much. I know I should have confronted her, but given that she was part of the social circle (she was my friends housemate; lived in a large house at uni of 15 people) I didn't say anything, but I resented her.

Anyway, I used that anger and hatred to motivate myself to study. I would pull all-nighters very often to prove people wrong. I fueled myself with hatred. As a result I got very good grades and got into a top university for my masters degree.

Now I secured an internship at a pretty prestigious place. I've been on full bragging mode on my snapchat, posting snaps like ''I knew my doubters were dumb shits'' (I knew my doubters would see these snaps, so I was being intentionally inflammatory).

I went back to my university city recently and saw my old friends who are still there. Anyway, they were on the phone to The Bitch and roasting her, poking fun at the fact that she is struggling to find a job. So I said ''Pass the phone to me''. 

Given that I was more confident now and didn't really care about social reprucussions as much (cos I don't go uni there), I took the phone and said ''Hi, its me throwawaaloal''. She said ''Oh, hey'' and then I proceeded to say this:

Me: ''Hahahaha, heard you couldn't get a job, yet your best friend (22F) has already landed an internship too. I've also got an internship at _____''

The Bitch: ''Oh, wow good for you''

Me: ''You're such a dumb shit that you can't get a job, and you studied a useless degree anyway. Honestly you have no chance anyway, maybe I can ask my boss at ____ to get you a janitor job''

Her: ''Is this the only reason you called me?''

Me: ''Hahaha'' (pass phone back to my friend)

It felt GOOD to get that off my chest, but my friends said I was an asshole and that she's already suffering (her boyfriend broke up with her and her friend has a job). 

I think it wasn't enough. Living a good life isn't good enough revenge me. I want my enemies (people who doubted me/hated on me) to suffer. I want to kick them while they're down. If you're my enemy, I WANT you to fail and suffer. This is the mentality which makes me successful but my friends disagreed, AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for asking my wife “what’s the magic word” | My wife is 7 months pregnant and on bed rest. Obviously I’ve been getting things for her and doing stuff for her. 

She’s not exactly been nice about it. In the two weeks she’s been in bed I don’t think I’ve heard a single thank you, maybe one please. Her requests aren’t phrased as requests, but as demands. Ie she doesn’t say “can you get water”, she says “get me water”. And it’s not like she’s been peachy outside of that. Every conversation ends in her complaining about something I’ve done. I bought the wrong tissues, the laundry isn’t done, etc. Its not like I haven’t been doing the housework either, I wasn’t even late on doing the laundry, I just hadn’t done it yet that day. 

So tonight when she told me to get something I asked “what’s the magic word” in a joking tone. Well it did not go over well. She started screaming at me, and I tried to apologize but she couldn’t hear it because she kept interrupting me. I eventually gave up apologizing and just walked away, and now I’m up because the sofa hurts my back.

1,"AITA for giving away my nephews dog | I've never been a Reddit user but I came here to post this question, since my nephew has been insisting I am some kind of witch over this issue. Forgive any mistakes as I do not know how this community works.

I am 47F and my nephew is 19. My sister died a few years back (god rest her soul) and with his dad in prison and no one else to really turn to, I have been taking care of him ever since. I never had kids of my own and dedicated my life to my career. When he came into my care I gave up a lot of time and energy for him. I had to completely realign my life for him and I was happy to do it. but with him, came a dog.

Now, about this dog, I NEVER liked this dog. My sister bought it for him when he was 12 and it was a holy terror whenever I was visiting. It barks all the time. It constantly needs attention. It's a nuisance. Its behaviour has not improved since it and my nephew came to live with me. I have put up with it for 3 years now, and my nephew has taken care of it mostly on his own.

My nephew is now attending university in the next city over. The plan was he comes by on weekends during the school year to do laundry and get a bite to eat, and stays here in the summer. He does not really live here anymore, yes he has his room here still, but he is an adult, I am still here for him and help him out, but taking care of his dog is not part of that. And I am not home enough to give it the attention it needs. It made a mess of my house and I got noise complaints from the neighbors and I go on business trips and don't want to spend the money on a petsitter for it, when I don't even like this dog.

So, after he left for college I put up an ad on Facebook for the dog, and ended up selling it to some nice family in the area. They have kids, who will actually be around to take care of the dog. I let my nephew know over the phone, and I even told him I was putting the money towards his textbooks, and he absolutely went mad. Started screaming about how the dog was a ""best friend"" to him and how it reminded him of my sister (his mom) and whatnot.

I explained to him that I wasn't able to give the dog the care it needed and that I had found it a good home. He continued saying he would've found somewhere for the dog to stay while he was at school and that I was some sort of ""witch"" for just getting rid of it ""like it was trash"" when I did no such thing, I found it a good home with kids. He has a life ahead of him and doesn't have any more time for it than I do. I let him keep the dog when he was here full time, he's a grown man now and at college, it was time to move on.

He is still upset and is trying to get me to take the dog back.

I dont really understand. Maybe its because I don't have kids or pets. My sister was really better suited for motherhood. If there is an issue here I want to try and make it right, or at least explain things to my nephew in a way that will make him understand why this was the best thing to do.

1,"AITA for snapping my phone in half? | So my phone is an absolute piece of shit. It's some 2015-2016 model Samsung, and I hate it. It's a hand-me-down from my parents, who convinced me not to buy a decent ass phone. I've stuck with it for a year, despite it being among other things, full of work shit, since it's an old office phone + slow as all fuck.

It's slow enough to physically enrage me. So yesterday my phone just froze. When the phone froze, It got stuck for like 7-8 minutes on the same screen before just jumpstarting again. I was texting multiple people, and it kinda fucked with the conversation. 

I missed a spot to hang out with a girl because I couldn't make any plans or even respond for several goddamn minutes, so I snapped it in half. I just grabbed both sides, snapped the piece of shit like a twig and smashed it on a counter. 

I'm already on my way to pick up my new phone, but my parents are freaking out over how ""ungrateful"" I am for smashing that phone.

0,"AITA for okaying my ex-huband to cut our daughter's hair that she refuses to take care of? | Back story. My ex is my ex for a reason. Long story short? I have mental health issues and chose to ""defy"" him and get myself help. He is a paranoid conspiracy theorist from everything involving the government(china taking over the US, systematic removal of non-contributing members of society, ect. Would constantly provoke my anxiety, he was very much aware of, to the point of hysterics before telling me to calm down and not worry), aliens, and anything involving an apocalypse. Divorce started messy. Butting heads and getting geared up to tug-of-war over the kids. With help from my g/f(dad was never around) and his baby mama(dad was always on deployment to avoid her mother), convincing him the only ones who will truly suffer are the kids. Eventually we settled amicably. He keeps his stuff and I get the kids after the school year, a tiny amount of maintenance(waved after I have the kids), and slightly more in support.

Anyhow our oldest, 8yrs, delayed, autistic, was refusing to attempt to take care of her hair(she is very capable of at least brushing it but refuses). My rule, as I was/am a SAHM and always cared for the kids, was if they want long hair they need to try to care for it otherwise it gets cut so it is more manageable. This applies to my son too as he wants long hair as well. Ex sent a text asking if I was cool with cutting her hair. I asked why? He explained she suddenly stopped trying , giving attitude about it and refused. Her long, thick hair was becoming more unmanageable (note he and his g/f work full time). I repeated my rule for their hair and said go for it if she is giving attitude about it and refusing to try to take care of it.

On a call with my mom I let her know about hair hair cut. Didn't need her blowing up about it in front of my kids. This angered my mother and demanded to know why my ex was chopping off all of ""her baby's"" long beautiful hair. I told her he asked me if I was okay with it. She demanded to know why the hell I would give him the satisfaction of make his life easier? I told her my rule as well. She then tried ""But she's 8 and autistic and she can't be held accountable"". I scoffed recounting being 7,8,9 years old and refused to brush my hair until she cut it. she tried saying I wasn't autistic. I called her BS. My nephew is autistic and she holds him accountable for basic care. She then gave up mumbling about how could I help my ex out? Told her it wasn't about helping him out and about reinforcing the rules. Just because we're divorced doesn't mean the kids get a free pass to act like fools and do as they please. Better for them to see we are on the same page than them try to play us on each other. My mom thinks I'm an asshole for not making his life harder for everything he put me through.

However whenever we go to my dads house his girlfriend and her daughter always put tv on for him and stick him in front of it. He's never there for longer then ten minutes because either me or his daddy remove him from the room.

We are both pretty good skiiers. A lot of women go to fancy ski resorts to wear expensive outfits, drink at bars, and party, but my girlfriend means business. She can ski circles around me, and I'm 100% proud of her. 

Usually she dresses nicely to ski, since it's a fashionable ski resort and she's a fashionable person. However, this weekend, she said she didn't feel like dressing up, and instead just wore black snowpants, an old parka, and a hockey jersey. I didn't see anything wrong with it. She also wore a pair of my old skis with the bindings adjusted to fit her boots and a black helmet. What I'm saying is, anybody who saw her would have thought she was a man. 

Anyways, we were in the gondola with this old couple. My GF (her helmet was still on) rested her head on my shoulder and we were holding hands. The couple must have mistaken her for a dude, because they gave us a weird look. The old lady whispered something to her husband. Then my GF took off her helmet, and they looked really confused when they realized she was a girl. 

We were making conversation with them, and then, just as we were about to exit the gondola, the old lady goes, ""Oh, we thought at first that you two were gays. Thank God."" She laughs and expects us to laugh with her. I reply, ""That's really fucking narrow minded of you. You should be ashamed of yourself."" Then her husband tells me to watch my mouth, my girlfriend basically drags me away before I can respond.

When I was 9, my father married his long-term mistress who he had been cheating on my mother with since the early days of their marriage. 

I never had a close relationship with my stepmother. I always blamed her for my mother’s unhappiness. I was polite to her but we were never very close. None of my siblings are. I have never called her “mom”, just her first name.

My father died a few years ago. Nowadays I see my stepmom maybe a few times a month. She sometimes babysits him when my wife and I are working. Yesterday my wife and I went over to her house to pick up my son after a week of us going on vacation together. Before we left, my son said “Bye grandma!” to her. She and my wife both “awwwed” and my wife said “thats the first time he said grandma!” 

I said to my son “No, she’s not your grandma, she’s just your auntie.” Immediately my stepmom looked really hurt and I apologized, I told her that I just didn’t want my son to get the wrong idea. My stepmom nodded and said she understands.

My wife got mad at me in the car. She said I was being really rude and that I  could have at least said something to our son in private.

My daughter is 20 years old. In high school, she got great grades and we always offered her support, tutors, etc. Never yelled at her or pressured her to get the grades, just told her we expected her to do her best. 

Then college came around. Once again, we told her that we expected the same. Just do your best and we’ll also supplement tutors and support as needed. She never came to us for help and told us she was doing well, but never showed us report cards. When we’d ask, she told us that we didn’t have a right to see them because they were private. She was receiving a scholarship and financial aid to go to college, so we weren’t paying a dime for it at the time and I felt like she was right in that respect.

Then, a letter came in the mail and she broke down, informing us that she had lost her scholarship and aid. We were confused. She said that her grades had been poor the past year and a half. She admitted to putting partying and socialization above her studying. We asked why wait so long and she said she kept thinking she would turn it around, but college was a lot harder. A part of me got that.

We came up with an offer: we would pay for what we could and co-sign student loans for the next few years. She doesn’t have to pay us back, just get up her grades and try to get her financial aid back. (No chance for the scholarship.) She agreed.

This semester, she said once again she was doing better. A few weeks ago when midterms came out, I asked her to show me her grades and she tried the whole “grade privacy” thing. I said now that I was paying for her education, I had a right to know what they were. We went back and forth for awhile, and she finally broke. They were quite good, so I didn’t get why she didn’t want to show me. She said, she just didn’t have to, because she’s an adult. I told her that as long as I’m paying, I have a right to see the grades.

Her finals are coming up in a few weeks and to prevent a future fight from happening, I let her know that I expect to be shown her final grades as well. She once again got mad and said it was unfair.

I have never met this guy in my life and I wasn’t acting out in anyway, at least not yet.

I tried to ignore what was going on and be the bigger person.

I raised my voice and asked him what he was doing. He answered “I am trying to take your girlfriend’s order but you are interrupting me”. It was on now.

I told him in a firm tone that I do not appreciate his attitude and to not come back to the table. I also asked to speak to the manager. I made a big scene. I did not scream, but I had raised my voice enough so the whole restaurant can hear.

I explained to the manager that the waiter is being inappropriate and that his attitude needs to be adjusted. I calmly explained what I witnessed, that  for one reason or another, he was inappropriately rude to me while borderline flirting with my girlfriend.

The manager apologizes profusely and got us another server. The waiter tried to come to our table and apologize but at this point I don’t have any nice sentiments towards him. I said to get away from the table and that I don’t give a shit. He tried to say something, but I just yelled “Fuck off!” at which point he just ran off. The rest of the dinner was fine. 

I tried to be patient and not cause drama but if I just accepted what was happening I wouldn’t have enjoyed myself. I also don’t appreciate some random waiter trying to hit on my girl when I am paying for the bill. I caused some drama. But it was necessary I believe.

0,"AITA for being upset with my girlfriend? | My girlfriend(25f) and I (22m) have been together for 1.5 years. We are both personal trainers. This all started right around the time we began dating. She got a new client that her mom is friends with his mom. Let call him John. John is 29-30 years old. He’s a nice guy and I do like him. When they first began training, he seemed to be texting her quite a lot, about things other than scheduling another session at the gym. I took notice and expressed to her that it was making me a little uncomfortable that he’s obviously interested in her and that was it. She said “oh that’s just John, I think he’s like that with everyone”. So I put it aside and didn’t bring it up again. Fast forward Christmas he surprises her with $100 gift cards and other things which I understand because I receive gifts from clients all of the time.



 Then comes her birthday, more gifts which she did not tell me about until yesterday for some reason because she didn’t want to make me “upset”. Then, yesterday she shows me a conversation between them, I suppose they were scheduling a video session with everything going on. But he continues to text her about other things and he end the message with something like “love you, miss you at the gym” and she responds “love you too and whatever else was said. 


Now, this is where I am stuck. I expressed to her how uncomfortable it makes me that she responded to that text with saying love you too. She says he’s just that nice and that’s how he is and that he’s not interested in her anymore now that we are together. I told her that what she replied was inappropriate and hurtful towards me and to place herself into my shoes. She does not think how she went about it was wrong and she doesn’t think it was inappropriate. 



To me, this feels like she is going behind my back and it gives a sense of untrustworthiness. 
I am not sure how to go about this now as she said she will not address this to her client and i am just being insecure.

Am I being insecure? I understand the need to be there for clients but I am in a relationship and would not be comfortable throwing that word around to my female clients that are close to my age. I just feel as this is leading people on and saying “he’s just like that” is not comforting at all. I do not like this and I am so uncertain what to even say at this point.",False,False
1,"AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend for airing dirty laundry and having excessive debt? | So I recently became debt free after moving in with my girlfriend, greatest feeling ever. She; however, is no where near debt free (20k+ in CC debt and a car that is worth only about 5k). Every time that I bring up that she needs to get on a budget and make a plan, she gets really defensive and hopeless saying that she is just going to accept it. Last week I told her that we should stop eating out and save our money so that she could work on paying off her debt. She agreed.

&#x200B;

Well yesterday, I went out for some beers with my friend and we watched the football game. I asked my girlfriend and our roommates if they had ever been to that place before. My roommates answered but then my girlfriend went into the chat and started saying, ""Oh you can go out with your boys, but if I want you to take me out then it's 'No we have to save money'?"" and she went off on me and she aired our dirty laundry (regarding finances) in the household chat.

&#x200B;

Airing dirty laundry is 100% unacceptable to me. I told her that I said what I said because she HATES when I tell her that I am debt free and she thinks I throw it in her face. So I just lumped myself in there and said we should both work on not spending money. I also told her that if she aired our dirty laundry like that again then I would break up with her because that's unacceptable to me.

0,"AITA for pulling my daughter out of dance | We recently moved and I found a new dance studio for my daughter. It had good reviews and such so I enrolled her.

The studio has a rule that requires one parent to be present for all the classes. Didn’t think much of this and went to watch my daughter, but the other parents quickly became nasty. They’re all much better off and made a lot of passive aggressive comments towards me about the clothes/shoes I bought for my daughter because they aren’t the nice brands. I stopped engaging, but they’ve escalated to talking about me loudly, ripping on my daughter’s skills constantly (never in front of her, but they do it in front of me), talking about how I shouldn’t have had her so young and I’m a shitty parent because I can’t give her the best life etc. I’ve tried ignoring them, tried calmly addressing the behavior, tried talking to the studio about it, but nothing has changed, and it’s starting to get to me.

I decided to pull my daughter from the studio and enroll her elsewhere.

1,"AITA for Seeking Prayers at a Scheduled Prayer Service? | Hello all. This week I was at a prayer service at my college fellowship. We have these once a week, and they are open to the public.  A student at our school died recently in an accident, and so there were more people at the service than normal. Lots of people were crying. I did not know him, but I still prayed for him with everyone else. 

During the service, people offer up statements and some ask for prayers. This time, lots of people were remembering the student but a few people asked for prayers for sick relatives, one for her cousin who was struggling with drug addiction, and then it came to me. 

I broke up with my girlfriend of about 3 months two weeks ago, and it has been really tough on me. She was also at the prayer service even though she is not as Christian as I am and normally was not there. She just happened to know the student who passed away. I asked people to pray for me that I recover from my breakup and that in the future I only date people who truly share my religious values because those people would not be hurtful. 

Fast forward to that afternoon, I got messages from several of my friends telling me that asking for prayers, during a prayer service, was inconsiderate. My ex girlfriend also sent me a message telling me that she found it hurtful and that she would prefer that I not speak about her again, at least not when she is present. I asked her what was wrong with what I said, and she told me I was attacking her. I was not! I never attacked her. 

I understand that people there were suffering, but we all suffer for different reasons. I am also suffering. I have never had such a tragic breakup, and I thought she was the one who I would marry. I was already looking at rings, and then she just broke up with me. I have a right to be sad, don't I? I have a right to ask to be lifted in spirit--we all have different crosses to bear.

1,"AITA for banning sleepovers at grandparents' house? | My daughters are 6 and 8. Their grandparents live in the next town over, about 2 hours away. My in-laws (the grandparents) came up with an idea for a cousin sleepover, where my daughters and all of the cousins would get together once per month for a movie and sleepover. It would allow all the cousins, who are around the same age, to spend time together. 

Last month, the girls had their first sleepover. I was nervous as it was their first time away from home without us. It all went well up until bedtime. They got up a couple of times around 9 pm. By that time, the in-laws were watching TV in the basement. They were watching violent shows (the walking dead) and my daughters saw enough for it to have scared them. The TV is positioned in such a  way that my girls would see it before the in-laws would see them. My father-in-law is also hard of hearing and the TV is always on full blast.

I found out because my daughters talked about it the next day. My husband & I asked the in-laws that they do not watch TV with adult content if my daughters are sleeping over. The in-laws insist that instead, they will be reinforcing a strict no coming out of bed rule. However, in unfamiliar surroundings, it is expected that kids could come out. My in-laws said that the other cousins have been sleeping over for years with no issues. So, my husband and I put a ban on it until we get assurances that they would not be exposed to adult content. While the in-laws insist that the shows are not a huge deal, they do not want their behavior restricted.

My in-laws and parents of other cousins are deeming us the assholes for robbing our kids of memories for something so negligible (in their eyes). So, am I the asshole?",False,False

Today he added a bunch of friends in a group, everyone who was either taking programming courses in uni or amateur programmers, and asked if we wanted to develop an app with him because he had a great idea, everyone talked about what they could or couldn't do, until i was added to the convo, i told him it wouldn't work and everyone had a ''million dollar idea'', and i was promptly removed from the group

Then there is a moment im not proud of, but i messaged him with a snarky remark telling him ''thank you for removing me from the group, i couldn't find the quit button on mobile'', and i was blocked

i really like him, he’s adorable, smart, nice, and romantic. but i made a mistake 2 days ago, he hasn’t spoken to me since.

i usually come to his house while his parents are out and leave before they come back. he said he wasn’t sure if he wanted to tell his parents about us yet, i got offended because i thought he really liked me. he reassured me and said he does, but he doesn’t think it’s the “right time” .  my family knows i’m dating him and have even met him a couple of times. anyway, i end up telling my friends about the incident and they start coming up with their own theories as to why he’s avoided telling his parents. i know we’ll be called dumb for this, but no one thought about the fact that he maybe wasn’t out yet. i assumed he was because all his friends know. 

i admit, i was dumb and careless. i wasn’t thinking about what i was doing at this point, but my friends and i got an idea, we decided to look his sister up on instagram, (she’s 2 grades lower than us). once we found her, my friend ended up messaging her telling her that her brother has a boyfriend. she was confused for a moment, but after my friend sent a couple of pictures, she understood and was cool about it. i guess she told her parents because my boyfriend called me a couple hours later saying my friend outed him to his whole family and that she’s a bitch for it. i obviously started defending my friend saying that all she did was tell his sister and that he shouldn’t be mad because she understood.

1,"AITA for being pissed at my dad although I damaged his most valued possession, but it wasn't my fault? | Tl;dr at the end

Alright, here's the issue. 

My dad bought himself a triumph motorcycle a couple years ago and it's his most valued possession. We're not that rich, so it's one of the most expensive things he's splurged on and he's taken good care of it every single day. 


I've recently turned 18 and learnt how to ride a motorcycle on a smaller bike, and slowly transitioned to using this huge, heavy monstrosity for errands nearby. I'm not allowed to take it very far yet, because it weighs about 4 times as much as I do and controlling it in high traffic takes experience.

Now here's the issue. About 2 weeks ago, while parking the bike, I fell down and screwed up the clutch and gear of the bike. Luckily, the repair wasn't expensive at all and since it was my first fall, he let it slide and asked me to be more careful next time. 

Now we move to today. He asked me to take the bike and go buy a couple things for him from 2 different stores. One store is the farthest he's ever let me take the bike, and one's pretty close to our house. I went and got the farther one done without a hitch. As for the second store, I parked the bike on a slight incline and went in. When I came out, I wore my helmet, put on my bag, and started the bike. Unfortunately, while I was inside, some dumbass played with the bike and pulled the choke and messed with the gears. The bike suddenly pulled and I ended up falling on my right. 

Now, I pushed the choke back in, and everything was fine and dandy. The thing is, my leg is fucked thanks to a hot exhaust and a heavy bike falling on my leg, and he didn't even bother looking at it. The second I went home, and told him, he ran to his bike and screamed his head off at me for getting scratches on it. I agree, there were a bunch of scratches, but it isn't my fault. It really pissed me off that he didn't Even bother looking at my burns and bleeds. We got into an argument, and he banned me from using any of the motorcycles at home. He also said he isn't going to buy me the car I was promised, and that he'd use my bank account to pay for the paint job and repairs for the bike. 


I don't think that's fair. I've been a good kid my whole life. I turned 18 a couple months ago. Everyone falls from their bikes while learning, and this wasn't even my fault, but now it looks like my dad and I have become mortal enemies. My mum is on my dad's side, saying I shouldn't have damaged his one and only prized possession, and that I shouldn't touch any geared vehicle anytime soon. It got me thinking I'm at fault, and I feel like shit now.


Tl;dr- My dad bought an expensive motorcycle which he recently let me start riding since I turned 18. I fell down and damaged it, but it wasn't my fault since someone pulled the choke and messed with the gears. My dad and mom have stripped me off my driving rights and are paying for the repair and paint job with the money that's in my account. I've been told it's my fault for so long that I actually feel like shit now. Am I the asshole here?",False,False

1,"AITA for refusing to eat dinner at a fancy restaurant during business trip? | I've been working for a fairly large software company as a software engineer ever since I graduated from college 2 years ago. I'm based in San Jose, CA. Recently we wrapped up a huge project for a company in NYC and they flew us out for a week to install the software at their HQ and make sure everything was working smoothly. The first night they took us out to a very fancy steak restaurant and treated us to dinner. I should mention that there were 3 representatives from their company as well as 4 people from my company, including myself and my boss.

During the dinner, I did not eat anything. I simply ordered several sparkling waters and sipped them the entire night. Every two months I have a 5 day span where I do not eat anything and only drink water and take multivitamins and electrolytes (this is called a water fast). It ended up that this business trip was during the week I was supposed to do this.

Anyway, I felt that during the entire time both my coworkers and the company representatives were very uncomfortable that I was not eating anything. Since I don't like to tell people that I fast every two months, I just say that I am not interested in eating right now or I am not hungry. People have tried to lecture me how it is extremely unhealthy to fast in the past and it's just easier for me to avoid the conversation.

Anyway, after the dinner my boss called me when I was back at the hotel and he told me that it was extremely disrespectful that I did not eat anything the entire time. He said it made the company look bad and that he had never been so embarrassed in his life. He said that he will discuss it with the director of engineering when we get back to the office next week and that he will need to speak with me in person about my inappropriate actions.

To be honest, I do not feel like I was the asshole in this situation, but I also am not known for knowing social cues all too well. I did joke around and converse with everyone at the dinner, I just did not want to eat. That said, it was a 7 course dinner and we were there for over 3 hours so it was a long time.

I am kind of dreading meeting face to face with my boss and the engineering manager next week...

Recently my wife has gotten very serious about minimizing her impact on the planet. This goes beyond reusable water bottles, grocery bags, etc. and has advanced to things like reusable dog poop bags or trying to go without using any electricity to name a couple.

As for me, I care about the environment but not the to degree of my wife. I value convenience and I will use a straw or a grocery bag if I forget the reusable ones in the car. I tend to be very optimistic and believe in human ingenuity to help solve these large issues humanity is facing.

With her increased intensity, I am more mindful of her values which impacts my decisions and those around me. For example, when we were with family, I suggested we not use paper plates and I offered to do the dishes with my wife which she really enjoyed.

Anyways, we recently went on a hike and while waiting for some stragglers to catch up, I decide to touch a tree and shake/bend it. Nothing extreme beyond what you might expect with some heavy wind. This triggered my wife and we've been at odds for almost 5 days now... over ""harassing"" a tree as she calls it. In her mind, I don't respect her values and don't support her with something she is so passionate about. She has called it her religion and she is worried that if we have kids I wont instill the same values she has for the environment. My thought here is, why does the kid have to have her values?

Since she calls it a religion, I tell her its not fair to impose her beliefs on others and that I shouldn't have to live my life 100% aligned to her values, but now she  wants me to apologize for touching the tree and I'm digging in my heels.

After dating for three months we started to have some disagreements. Basically, I became very involved and wanted her to be my full-time girlfriend, while she wanted to stay in a more loose, friends-with-benefits kind of relationship (but remain faithful to each other).

I was really close to him, he thought me so many of the things I know today, always giving me lessons in some shape or form. He was an impossibly kind and gentle person, always striving to help someone out or care for them.  He had been sick for a good few months previously, and unfortunately he was suffering because of this. Constantly in pain and confused... when I heard he had passed, I couldn't help but feel relieved that he was finally at peace. 

When the funeral came around, I didn't feel sad, I couldn't cry. I was focusing on all the incredible things that happened because of him, and all the good be brought in life. Everything he had thought me and how he affected everyone who he'd ever met.  I couldn't stop thinking about how he was finally free from all the pain and confusion that had turned him into a husk of a person. I couldn't help myself from feeling genuinely happy that he had finally passed. 

My whole family, including my boyfriend were in tears during the ritual.  Afterwards, my boyfriend asked me why I wasn't crying during the funeral. He said it wasn't normal to not cry.  I told him that I was focusing on the good aspects, that yes I was sad he was gone and yeah, of course I'm devastated that I'll never see him again, but his death wasn't sad to me.   It's something I was preparing myself for, for months previously. It was something at points I actually hoped would come sooner, to ease his suffering.   I'll miss him so much, but at the same time, he'll continue to live on through me and everyone else in my family through the things he thought us and the stories he shared. 
My boyfriend kept insisting that it wasn't normal.  he told me I shouldn't be bottling things up because I'd regret it later, that I shouldn't conceal my emotions, and I should be open and honest with him. 

But the thing is, I was being honest. I wasn't sad, I couldn't cry. I was happy he had passed on. I'm not a very religious person,  but I'm still of the belief that nothing really dies. Something will always remain something in my eyes. He'll remain living in my memories.  

This ended up in an argument.  I know he's just concerned for me, I know he thinks I'm bottling things up and concealing my emotions, and he's worried about my mental health. I know he was very emotional from the day and that's okay, arguments happen. 
But still, it left me thinking.

1,"AITA for wanting bf to take responsibility for what he did | So Ive talked about the situation slightly before on reddit (not in major detail for this bit)& will be discussing it tonight at couples therapy but I wanted to get anon opinions anyway.

So a year ago I had gone onto my bfs computer to play a game.However he had left his chat open.For a bit of context Id just had a MAJOR fight with my father who essentially walked out of my life & my bf seemed to be kind & supportive the whole way through.This doesnt justify what I did but gives some clarity to what happened next.I read some of the messages(not because I thought he had done something)as I wanted to learn more about what he liked.Again not justifiable it was wrong & I recognize that now.Regardless what I instead found was him insulting me & bad mouthing me behind my back specifically in regards to the fight with my father.I felt horribly betrayed.We argued & after a while he promised he would never do that again.That if he had something to say about me he would say it to my face rather than pretend he was supportive.Over the next year I did not touch his messages once.My mother did that to me constantly looking for any wrong doing.I dont think thats how a relationship should be & again we had agreed to talk. 

Then a few months ago after I found out I was pregnant I wanted to use his phone to buy a gift for him(his has amazon prime mine does not).Which is when I found out he had changed his pin.(Mind you if I SHUT my phone in front of him hed get anxious so him hiding a password was VERY unlike him).He only admitted it was bc of messages when I asked specifically.He refused to tell me what was said though.This went back and forth for weeks.One day after coming home early I saw his computer was unlocked.I tried for half an hour to not think about it, Hell I even tried to turn it off but couldnt figure out how to without messing up his computer(he built it himself so it doesnt look like the standard PC).Finally I convinced myself if I just *knew* what was said I could move on.It was horrid.His friend was constantly telling him to lie to me, tell me he was cheating on me, calling me horrible names over the best of things(like when I’d bought us a couples massage-that got me called a “wasteful idiotic bitch”).Never once was I defended.In fact it was HER idea to put on the passcodes.

My bf says that I violated his privacy by reading his messages.Thats true.I hated when my mother did that.So Im not saying he cant feel violated but he insists Im the only one in the wrong here.He won’t acknowledge that he shouldnt have sent such horrible messages in the first place.Its like if I were cheating on him(im not for the record i.e. only) he shouldn’t be allowed to go through my phone anymore based on his logic but that doesn’t make me cheating right.

1,"AITA for refusing to have biological children with my wife? | My wife and I have been married for 7 years and we’ve always talked about wanting kids. We’re  both 29 years old and started trying to conceive about a year ago but have been unsuccessful. We recently decided to get checked out by a fertility specialist and opted to have extensive genetic testing done. The genetic counselor said there isn’t a reason they can point to as for why we haven’t conceived yet, but the bad news is that we are both carriers of a genetic disease that could cause our children to go blind. The risk of having a blind child is about 25% with each pregnancy. 

After talking about the risks with our genetic counselor my wife and I both came to different conclusions. She still wants to experience pregnancy and childbirth and is okay with taking the 25% chance. I’m not.

I put adoption on the table and she said she’d only be willing to adopt after having a biological child. She says donor sperm isn’t an option because she wants to have *my* kids and that I’m taking that option away from her over a “small” risk. 

Two night ago we had really bad fight over it. Hurtful things were said by both of us. During the fight I said that pregnancy is hard and most people suffer through it so It’s not like she’s experiencing a great loss. She can keep her flat stomach and not have to suffer through 9 months of sickness. I told her that her mindset is negative. She disagreed with that and said she see’s nothing to be positive about. She called me a coward for wanting to let my kids be fathered by a donor. I responded that of course she’s never going to see the positive in the situation because she’s 100% negative, just like all of her pregnancy tests were the last year and how they always will be. 

That’s the line that caused her to start sobbing and leave the house. She packed a bag and told me she was going to stay with her sister and that she’d call me when she was ready to talk. She’s been gone for two nights now. It will be three if she doesn’t come back tonight.  I don’t want to extend the olive branch and call her first because I’m still pissed. 

I don’t know if this post is even a question or a cry for help at this point. 
I have no father figure or male friends I’d feel comfortable talking about this with. Instead I’m asking strangers on reddit  because I’m drunk and at rock bottom.

1,"AITA for correcting my SIL when she called me ""blessed""? |   

  

This is going to be a longish one, sorry in advance, TL;DR at the bottom.

For context: my husband's family is extremely academic, they hold education above almost everything else. But they hold education so high they don't fully understand real world job experience has value too. They pretty much think that if you have enough education (no matter what your degree) then a job should just magically fall into your lap. This is what my husband's middle sister (MS from now on) believes. MS has been working on getting her honors, her grades are good and she's going to be finishing this spring. But, MS has never had a steady job. She's done short contract work (5ish weeks) and volunteers to teach Catechism every Sunday. Now that’s she's graduating she's struggling to find a job. MS has been looking for about 2 weeks now and last night this happened.

We were visiting the MIL at her place and MS was talking to her mum (my MIL) and complaining that she couldn't find a job, MIL tried to be encouraging, and pointed out that my husband and I were able to find work after looking for some time. But then MS said ""well I guess I'm just not at blessed as OP and OP's husband"". (Yes, she actually said ""blessed""). I then inserted myself into the conversation (I am paraphrasing here)

&#x200B;

Me: ""Excuse me, but I am not 'blessed', I worked hard for my job. There's a difference.""

MS: ""That's not what I meant, you were just lucky to get your job.""

Me: ""MS, I didn't 'get lucky'. I worked. I had other jobs and work experience alongside my schooling that made me a better candidate for my job""

MS: ""Well I worked too.""

Me: ""No, you went to school and did your school work. You didn't have a job or get experience.""

MS gets kinda quiet and I keep going

Me: ""Jobs look at both school and past work experience and in my opinion they like to see work experience more than an educational degree. So I did both. Yes my grades weren't as good in the end but at least I have a job now.""

&#x200B;

At this point the conversation gets awkward and I decide keep my mouth shut. MS left and went off to her room. We stayed for a while and chatted with MIL and MS didn't come back out. The next day my husband mentions that he was talking to his mum and that MS was very upset at what I had said. MIL wanted my husband to talk to me and tell me to apologize to MS for ""being quiet rude as MS is doing her best"". Now I don't know what to do, am I an asshole for correcting MS? I can talk loudly but I never yelled or snapped at MS. I do have what I call ""resting bitch voice"" where somethings I say will sound way meaner, I try and do my best to not sound like a bitch but it happens.

TL;DR - my SIL is graduating and struggling to find a job and calls me ""blessed"" for having a job so I correct her saying I worked hard and got previous experience to be able to get my job then SIL goes silent and I hear the next day from MIL that I was mean to SIL and should apologize.",False,False

She's currently unemployed and her unemployment wouldn't be enough to cover a move anyway and so I offered to help financially when the time comes to make up the difference between what she needs and has saved to cover the cost of a move. 

In addition to this financial help I have been helping to post her resume on Craigslist, Indeed, Glassdoor, and other job websites so that she could have more hooks in the water for potential offers. 

The thing is, she doesn't seem to be doing her part in this endeavor and I feel like I'm caring all for nothing. She has been putting her social life ahead of her current needs, her job availability is centered around her newly found interest in being a dominatrix at parties and so she's unavailable Friday's after 4pm and on weekends. She also refuses to get a job with her current skill set in waitressing/hosting and would instead like to try for an office job, which is fine but today asked that I take down all of her online ads looking for a job because in her words ""It's too much for me right now"".

Whenever this happens she gets upset and wants to show me right away. For instance, we were with a friend playing cards and she saw a video of a child getting hit by a car in his front yard that went into excruciating detail about his injuries (paraplegic, brain damage etc.). It was extremely depressing and kind of put a damper on the night. I told her that I was sorry but that I didn't want to see things like this anymore, because it effects my mood. I know I'm staying willfully ignorant to the harsh realities of the world, but I've accepted that I am not a saint. 

It came up again last night when she saw a headline about young girl getting kidnapped in Mexico, that also went into detail. As soon as she read the headline I said no thanks and that I don't think she should read it either. She started reading out loud anyway and I said that I was really sorry but I didn't want to hear about it. She kept reading anyway and so I left the room. Argument ensued. 

Keep in mind that anything she wants to talk about that actually happens in her life I do my best to be as supportive as possible and will talk about it for hours.

She's been fighting for a little over 5 years now and it's really taken a toll on our family. Due to her treatment, she's been in and out of the hospital for years, and hasn't had much experience getting to actually be a kid. 

Recently, the disease metastasized to her lungs, and the doctors wanted to put her on a new treatment immediately. My parents brought her into the hospital to start her next round, but she didn't want to. She was hysterically crying saying she just wanted to go to Heather's birthday party and be a normal kid. ""No more treatment"" she kept saying. Heather is one of her best friends and her party was a few days away, my sister knew that if she started treatment she wouldn't be able to go to the party, but it was more than that, my sister is tired of it all and just doesn't want to do it anymore. My parents wouldn't listen though, and since she's under 18, she doesn't get a say. 

After hearing how upset my sister is, and knowing all of the pain she's endured, I couldn't just sit there anymore. My parents left the room for a few minutes to talk to the doctor, and I put my sister in her wheelchair and RAN. We made it out of the peds wing and actually down to the lobby and almost through the doors before we were stopped (I think me running rather than casually walking gave it away, but I didn't have much time). 

Since I'm her sister and didn't make it out, I didn't face any real consequences from the hospital, but my parents are furious.

So, I (17M) Live at home. I live with my mom, and two of my three brothers. My mom is going to sell the house in five years when my youngest brother goes to college. She decided that she would paint the basement so that it is ready to be sold in five years. She also wants us to help paint it for free. I said I would like payment, but she disagrees heavily.

So my mom's argument is that things like painting yardwork, and general maintenance are all part of the responsibilities of being in this family. I disagree strongly. I didn't choose to be born into this family (or even born in general). Why should I shoulder obligations that I didn't ask for? I couldn't leave even if I wanted. I don't drive. Nowhere in my town would provide housing to a minor. The nearest deli is a 45 minute walk through the woods, and the nearest supermarket is a 30 minute bike ride, when I'm not even allowed to leave my street. So, I am stuck in these conditions that I didn't choose. My mother mocked this argument. She made fun of me, saying I chose to be born by being the fastest sperm.

I adopted my husbands daughter Ella a few years ago, but have been in her life since she was two, and she has always considered me to be her mother. Both girls are 16 and in year 11. 

Ella and Laura had a huge row today over a present that I got Ella. 

Ella had mock exams a while ago. She absolutely smashed it. The highest possible grade in every exam she took. Even though these exams are unofficial and don't count towards her final grade, I wanted to get her something special to celebrate. 

A woman I work with personally knows a very reputable dressmaker/designer. Ella will be having her school prom in the summer and wants a nice dress. I looked into getting her a bespoke prom dress. 

It was quite a long process, with several appointments from the initial measurements onwards, but Ella loved the experience of getting a uniquely designed dress perfectly tailored to her, and the finish product looks absolutely stunning. Needless to say the service wasn't cheap. 

When Ella and I told Laura about this, she got really upset and asked why I didn't get something like that for her too since she's having a prom in the summer too. She does OK in school. Her teachers like her and she works hard, but her grades are quite average. She generally meets the pass mark with an occasional high grade. Nothing wrong with that but not deserving of a huge reward like I got Ella

Laura thought my reasons were ''stupid'' and started accusing me of loving Ella more than her which isn't true. I love them equally. 

Laura and Ella started arguing when Ella thought it would be funny to joke that we could always get Laura a dress from the charity shop. They usually get along quite well, but after that they called started calling each other every name under the sun. Laura called her dad to pick her up and said she doesn't want to come here again.

Move into a new house a few months ago. Brought my outdoor cat. He is more of an outdoor cat who comes inside occasionally, usually he just suns himself in the backyard as he is older.

Recently, a neighbour has come to my house 3-4 times a week complaining the cat is meowing at their door and accused me of negligence and not taking care of the cat. I apologized and let him him and kept him in for a few days then let him back out. Same thing happened again, cat meowing they come over and complain.

Their daughter accused me of being a negligent owner because he is out during the days, and when they gave him food that he ate the entire can. He is also a very thin cat (has been his entire life). Their belief was that he wasn't being fed. I told her that he is on a special low protein diet and requires special food, which is why he ate their crap quality tinned stuff (it is like McDonalds to cats). She apologized for feeding him (no problem, they didn't know). I then found out they have been feeding him all sorts of things like sausage and other tinned food.

The mother of the house came by and got uppity about him being outside and bothering them. I asked her if they fed him, which she denied. I called her out on it immediately as their daughter had told me they fed him, and a neighbour also commented that they feed him. I told her that I was not keeping him inside permanently because of a mistake THEY made (I thought it was common knowledge not to feed animals). She got more uppity with me and I closed the door on her. I have kept the cat inside for a week or so, but he is antsy to go outside.

0,"AITA for being mad at my friend(18F) for banning her boyfriend(18M) from being friends with me(18F)? | Background: The three of us go to uni together

Last year, I was close with this guy Alex. He was my best friend and we would spend a lot of time together. I had no feelings for him and he didn’t either, but my entire school was convinced that he did. There were rumors about him being in love with me but I never heard/felt anything like that from him, except once at a nightclub when he was VERY drunk. We were just friends though, and I was never attracted to him in that way.

A while later I started getting close with this girl Melissa. We started spending a lot of time together and I introduced her to Alex. A few months passed and Alex and Melissa started dating. Thats when Alex started pulling away from me. That’s completely understandable as he had less time and he had a new gf and everything. But out of the blue, he completely stopped talking to me. He wouldn’t even say Hi back to me in the hallways. I was hurt and I told Melissa about it and she acted surprised and even comforted me.

Alex and Melissa broke up a few months ago. I found out from a mutual friend that Alex had stopped talking to me because Melissa had forbidden him from talking/interacting with me in any way. Even when he would ask me about schoolwork or something academic, she would cry and argue with him.


I’m really mad. I’m not going to say anything to them but I still think it was a shitty thing for Alex and Melissa to do.

Alex for valuing a girl over his supposed « best friend » and Melissa for asking him to do this in the first place and lying about it.

My friends think I have no reason to be mad. According to them, Melissa asking Alex to stop talking to me was justified because Alex had feelings for me. But the way I see it, these were just rumors. He was my friend. 

They think I’m the asshole for not being more understanding cause Melissa was apparently really insecure about herself as she thinks i’m « prettier » than she is and I’m not putting myself in her shoes. They also think that Alex had to prioritize Melissa over me, since she was his gf.

Parents are mostly skeptical of a male teacher. She said she wouldn't have me do it anyway since I'm a guy and the owner isn't comfortable with it anyways.

1,"AITA for having a bad reaction at Christmas Eve dinner when the waitress forgot my dish? | Tonight I went to my family Christmas dinner. I am not close to my family. My parents were not good people and I was shitty to them too growing up, but we have an amicable relationship when we see each other. 

We went out to Christmas Eve dinner and everything was okay, but by the time everyone was halfway done eating the waitress told me she forgot to put an order for my dish. I was so hungry and I freaked out. I told her to get a better job. Then my dad says “Why do you have to ruin everything?” which has a lot of negative connotation given our past. I just left, got in my car and drove home.

1,"AITA for telling my friend to not self diagnose himself with autism? | I have a friend that's sure he's on the autism spectrum. In school, a teacher shushed him and he didn't talk for the rest of the year because he thought he wasn't allowed to talk at all. Just head shakes and nods. He didn't know how to shake hands until the 8th grade. He couldn't walk and talk until age 3, he wore diapers until he was 6, he doesn't make eye contact, and he's convinced he's a raging psycho if you criticize him, which is often since he says stuff that's 100% normal to him, but weird to everybody else. He's overly interested in computers, weather, radios, and the emergency alert system. He's like the Michael Jordan of writing. He'll write a beautiful essay for 6 hours and erase it all because he didn't like how it flowed.

His social worker in high school pushed for him to get tested. His special needs program had him listed as Emotional Disability. To him, that's good enough. He identifies as autistic, and he doesn't get that people who self diagnose themselves make things harder for professionally diagnosed autistic people. He just makes the same excuse that he can't afford to get it written down on paper, and that he gets accommodations anyway so it'd be pointless.

We've had friends who self diagnosed themselves with autism to excuse their bad behavior. That's my whole issue: Self diagnosing himself will just let him blame us for calling him out. Even if my own brother didn't have autism, I'd still take issue with it. In fact, all of us in the group do. AITA? He thinks I'm being dismissive of autism when I'm just telling him a professional would have a better idea of what problem he has than some social worker he saw years ago.",False,False
0,"AITA for not babysitting my brothers kids? | Bare with me as at first it seems like i am 100% the asshole:

—————————Relevant —————————

Now i am a frequent member of r/childfree. I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.

So suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.
——————————————————————

My brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, 

It is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.

Now they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.

So him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.

When i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.

Tldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**

Edit: i should also mention that they dont think its a big deal since im home most of the time anyways, but i still dont have the time to babysit a four year old, and a six year old.",False,False
0,"AITA for purposefully having a 10-11 year engagement? | My fiancée and I have been together since we were 16 and 17. I was a grade above her. We knew we wanted to get married, but we both had goals that made a young marriage not an option. I wanted to become a doctor before getting married. My fiancée wanted to graduate college and have a career of her own.

We secretly got engaged right after  high school graduation and moved forward with our individual plans. After her freshman year in college, it became financially necessary to live together. Our families don't like couples living together outside of marriage, but an engaged couple gets a sort of exception, so we staged a new engagement for our families and we were able to live together in peace. 

I finished med school this past year, and we finally had a wedding planned in April which is now not possible. We've gotten full refunds and our vendors are very accommodating. The issue is a new date. We want to hold off until April 2022 because this is realistically going to last 18 months and we want more time to plan around societal/economic changes.

Our families are furious. They say that we just used being engaged as an excuse to ""live in sin"" for a DECADE and that we have no intentions of ever getting married. My fiancée will be 29 by our new wedding date, which is an unusual age for first marriage in our families. We're getting a lot of criticism for not going to the courthouse, which isn't even possible right now and not what my fiancée wants.

Not like any of the male models that incel say you need to be like, but still pretty good...just worked out, groomed and wore nice clothes as well as going out my comfort zone to increase my confidence.

I got laid a bit then met my now girlfriend (22F). Been dating 6 months and it's pretty serious.

She doesn’t make much money (she’s a teaching assistant) but every month she saves up enough to take me and her out for a girly dinner date. Each time without fail she will pick somewhere like Nandos where I *could* get a vegan dinner but I’d honestly prefer if we went somewhere 100% vegan run for moral and ethical reasons. 

Like I said I’m disabled and can’t work so as much as I’d like to take her out I can’t. I’ve suggested before restaurants we can give a go (we live in London!! There are loads!!) but she gets upset and tells me she can’t afford their prices for meals she won’t even enjoy. 

I asked her again this week reminding her I’d rather go somewhere vegan and she actually said to me on the phone ‘I’m really sorry Holly but I think this month we’ll have to leave it, I just don’t think you’re being grateful about our dates’.

1,"AITA for not wanting my sister to announce her pregnancy at my wedding even though I announced mine at hers? | Sorry if the title is confusing. Backstory: About three years ago, my boyfriend and I found out we were expecting our first baby. We got together for lunch with my sister and her fiance and we told them our pregnancy news. They were the first people we told since I’m really close with my sister. They were super excited for us and to my surprise, my sister suggested that we announce our pregnancy to the whole family at her wedding, which was to take place two months later.

At first I was like, no way, because I know that “you don’t announce you’re pregnant at someone’s wedding” is like Wedding Etiquette 101. But my sister and her fiance both assured me and my bf that they were okay with it, that they’d tell everyone that it was their idea so no one thought we were rude for doing it, that they wanted to share the joy of the day with us. I was still hesitant but we talked about it more and eventually my bf and I agreed to do it. So, my sister and her husband got married, my boyfriend and I announced we had a baby on the way at their wedding reception, and honestly everything went perfect.

Current situation: Roles have switched. My boyfriend (now fiance) and I have an amazing two-year-old daughter and we are getting married in a few months. My sister and her husband are now the ones expecting their first baby. She's early on and previously had an early miscarriage so they want to wait before announcing to more people.

My sister told me that she would like to announce her pregnancy at my wedding, just like I did at her wedding three years ago. Me and my fiance don’t want her to...we want the attention to be all on us on our wedding day. My sister was shocked when we told her this, as she really thought we’d say yes since we announced at her wedding. She’s saying that it’s selfish and unfair that we got to announce our baby at her wedding, but we don’t want to let them announce their baby at our wedding. She and her husband think we’re being major assholes and I don’t know if I should just give in and let her. I regret that I ever agreed to announce my pregnancy at their wedding.",False,False

I was getting a hint that he was going to break up with me as he kept talking about unfinished business. Still, I thought everything was going well in the relationship and I felt he needed some space to think. It came as a shock when he said he wanted to take a break and learn how to be a good friend to me and maybe more again in the future. The problem is, I was suppose to accompany him to day surgery later on this week as he was going to go under general anesthesia and you need to have someone drive you home.

I saw a post in a group requesting funding, of a lady who has little money and had a faint positive on a pregnancy test. She was requesting financial help to get another test to be sure before she sought medical help due to insurance.

From her post, it gave the vibe that she very much did not want to be pregnant, yet half of the comments were things like ""congratulations"" ""you're going to be a mama"" etc.

I made a comment simply stating that perhaps its best not to be congratulating a woman who may not actually want to be pregnant, and so many women jumped on me.

0,"AITA for excluding my daughter from a school gradebook? | Throwaway because I have some family who read this sub. Also, apologies to any readers not familiar with American college jargon. 

My daughter Anni is 17 and a senior in high school. She’s brilliant at English, history, philosophy, and similar classes. However, she has a learning disability called dyscalculia that hinders her math ability greatly. Her foreign language and science abilities are also affected to a lesser extent. That being said, she rose to every challenge and gave it her all, passing  the exams she needed to graduate with her IEP. Even if it was by one point! She took both the SAT and the ACT twice, but mainly applied to test optional schools with a great essay, and got into her “reach” choice early decision, meaning she is bound to go there and has to withdraw other applications. It’s a very good school (one of the seven sister colleges), and it took us all by surprise. 

Anni’s high school releases a booklet every spring that anonymously lists all graduating seniors GPA and SAT/ACT scores along with the colleges they’ll be going too. Students in future years use it as a grade guide. It is optional to have your child excluded from this. Because Anni is the only one in her class  going to her college, I felt like her grades would be easily recognizable, and her scores are NOT representative of her as a student since math and science are so negatively effected. Therefore, her mother, Anni and I together chose not to have her scores sent in when the time comes. 

Today, my SIL (her son and Anni are in the same year) mentioned the booklet while on the phone with my wife, and my wife mentioned that Anni’s scores will not be released. SIL said that was a nasty move, and that Anni is going to go to a good school a lot of people want to go to, and her test scores should be available for others. The thing is, her test scores AREN’T what got her into the school, or was her essay. SIL thinks we need to reconsider to “be fair” but I think we’re in the right.

I took this as a friendly suggestion and thought oh, maybe it will be good luck. in no way did the text suggest, I make the bet FOR him, but just as a suggestion. the exact text was ""bet 20$ on 32!!"".

I like Stranger Things, and I have been slowly making my way through Season 2. I asked my mum to pause the show for half an hour while I made dinner to avoid spoliers. 

I was going to make some frozen Pelmeni, essentially dumpling pasta that you boil for 10 mins, add some pasta sauce out of a jar and hey presto you've got a delicious albeit not exactly nutritious meal. 

Stranger Things was playing in the kitchen, as our living room and kitchen are all basically in one big room. Having already made her dinner and with wine glass in hand my mother refused, saying this was HER time that she's been working all day for and it takes precedent. I said I couldn't make my dinner in there avoiding spoliers, especially as the meal requires you to just wait by it, stirring occaisionally as it boils, not really a task that would consume all your concentration. 

Additionally our TV is really big and turned up really loud. I couldn't even look the opposite way from it as there are several large windows on the opposite side to the TV which clearly reflect the screen. 

I really hate spoilers, even seeing an image or a snatch of dialogue can reveal major plot points, for example the scene that was playing as we argued were of two characters in a relationship that hadn't existed in the parts of Season 2 I'd watched, now all that development is wasted for me.

I feel bad for him but I don't think he should be working and my supervisors all just keep letting him work because they also feel bad for him. 

I'm just going to list a few major incidents I think Jim needs to be fired for. Jim is on morphine and fell asleep in a storage closet until a janitor found him at 1 am. Jim fell asleep at his station and his bare hands went into the food, students saw it. Jim isn't supposed to lift more than 5lbs but did and dropped a stock pot full of soup in splashed multiple people no serious burns thankfully.

Due to his physical limitations which he has a doctor's note for he's incapable of doing his job. We work in a kitchen our job description is to be able to lift at least 50 lbs. Jim works my station which is for students with dietary restrictions and allergies. He was moved there as its the lightest work load only 500 servings a meal. Due to the allergies we have special ceramic serving pans (Jim broke 3 out of 6 of them this month) and our food is only supposed to be touched by us with special oven mitts and everything to prevent cross contact with potential allergens on the aprons or uniforms of others, Due to Jim not being able to lift 5lbs he can't take anything out of the oven himself. This is a super policy violation for my station and a risk for the kids with sever allergies.

This is where I think I may be the asshole, I just don't think it's fair he's getting paid the same as the rest of us to do a fraction of the work. I don't want him to be jobless but I do think he needs a job that's not in a kitchen.

The event is taking place within the client's own facilities, so of course, everyone's been instructed to be on their best behavior.

I was obviously infuriated. I called her later that day and talked to her, asking her to watch the kind of language she uses while we're within our client's facilities.

The thing is that I knew for a fact this wasn't the first time she'd made those kind of stupid jokes. So I waited a couple days and fired her on the grounds that she had been late to work three times during this month. A perfectly legitimate reason, while at the same time a dishonest one, since the actual reason why I was firing her was what I heard.

I go to the gym a few times a week as it's something I enjoy. Yesterday I was there for the first time this year and there was lots of new people which is to be expected this time of year with people making resolutions they can't stick to.

Anyway I was minding my own business when I looked up and saw an overweight woman come in who had a walking stick, she also had who turned out to be her husband with her who looked like a gym regular. I saw her get on the exercise bike for about 20 minutes then she moved to the weight machines. Because of her disability she couldn't manage on and off the machines herself and her husband was helping her on and off between his workout. I was concerned about this and no staff were about so I went upto her and told her I think it's for the best she leaves the gym as she's clearly not able bodied enough for it (looking back now I should have worded it better). Her husband then came up and asked if everything was ok and I told him my concerns. He raised his voice slightly at me and told me to mind my own business as he's qualified in training different sports and she was in safe hands.

I then told them I don't think the gym management would be too happy at someone disabled and unable to get on and off the machines being in the gym. He told me his wife wasn't actually allowed to join the gym without a Dr's letter and also a meeting with the gym manager to come up with a plan for her to safety evacuate the building with the help of staff and all staff were aware of her problems.  At this point I realised they weren't going to leave so went back to my workout.

Today I told my friend what happened and he told me I'm an idiot who should learn to mind his own business or try encourage someone who's new to the gym.

1,"AITA for being annoyed at my best friend for breaking our marriage pact? | My best female friend and I have went to elementary, middle, and high school together. We never dated each other since we would rather be best friends for life. We dated other people in high school and that never impacted our friendship. When we were 22 and single, we thought it would be fun to make a pact that if we were both not married by 32, we would get married to each other. We got that idea from a foreign film we saw together. 


We talked about this pact often until she got married when she was 28, had a kid and got divorced two and a half years later. I have had several short-term relationships. I turned 32 in September and her birthday was yesterday. I called her to say happy birthday and mentioned our pact. She said she isn’t ready for this much commitment yet. She talks about her daughter and being busy with work. I told her that I like her daughter and don’t mind taking her in as my own and I’ll give her as much time as she needs, but she told me to please just drop this discussion. 


I got a bit annoyed and asked her what was the purpose of this pact if we are not going to honor it. She says it’s a lot different never having been married than having been married and divorced, that I would never understand her reservations.

When we were teenagers, I developed the biggest crush on her. Unfortunately, when I confessed my feelings to her, she turned me down, and told me she only ever saw me as a friend. It broke my heart, but we continued being good friends anyway, hanging out after school, going to anime cosplays conventions and other geeky stuff.

We kinda grew apart after high school and went to different universities. Though we weren't close anymore, we still call each other occasionally and hanging out over the summer holidays.

Jess started dating Andy during her senior year, and married him a year after she graduated. As for me, I realized I was gay and have only been in romantic relationships with men since.

Years past, and one day, I got a call from Jess. She was crying. She said she just got into a fight with Andy. She asked if she could come over because she didn't feel safe at home.

I freaked out, thinking she was in danger, so I told her to come over to my apartment asap and I'll meet her at the lobby to greet her. I thought that the security at my apartment would keep her safe if her husband was planning to do anything to her.

When she got to my apartment, she was mess. She was crying and everything. I told her she could stay with me while she got things settled down. I had an extra bedroom, that is use as a guest bedroom when my parents are in town.

We ended up hugging on the couch, while she was crying on and off. She suddenly told me how she wished she had reciprocated my feelings before when I confessed my feelings years ago but didn't dare to because she didn't want to ruin our friendship.

I told her honestly that I'll always be her friend. The romantic feelings I had for her had faded a long time ago. I'm now seeing someone, and things between he and I are getting serious. But she is still welcome to stay in the guest bedroom until things settled down.

I was bothered by what had happened that night. I confided in my partner (the same one as above) and he said I was an asshole for letting her stay over. 

He said while he has nothing against it, it's socially inappropriate for a single man to allow married woman to spend the night as his place. What did I expect was going to happen? I could've ruin Jess' marriage with Andy.

I took the day off today to take my daughter to the doctor. When I got back my wife had clogged the toilet. She knows how to unclog it but chose not to. She told me to unclog it. So I get the plunger and go to town on it, and she immediately tells me I’m doing it wrong. I let that slide. She then tells me to hurry up and get out of the room. I told her that she knows how to plunge the toilet and that I don’t have to help her. She immediately starts crying and leaves. I then maybe an hour later get a text from her friend saying that I’m a dick. I don’t know what she told her but from my perspective I’m not an asshole.

1,"AITA for walking out of a massage and not paying? | Earlier this week I went and got a massage from a place I've been to once before and really liked. The time I went before was my first ever massage, and I was super excited about going again. When I got in, I got undressed, I laid on the table, yada yada, and the masseuse started my massage. But I mean, he didn't ""really"" start it.. he was just using one hand and moving it with way to much pressure up the side of my spine. My first thought was that he must be on his phone or doing something else that had him distracted and the real massage was about to start. But it didn't. He did this same move, with only one hand, for 40 minutes. I felt so uncomfortable interrupting him but it was just the worst. I finally spoke up and said I needed to use the bathroom. I stood up and got dressed and took my purse, phone, everything with me to ""use the bathroom"". I did end up walking over to the bathroom, and then realized that the exit was the other way. I tried to get up to reception sneakily, but my masseuse was waiting at the door of the room, basically standing in the hallway. I walked by him and held up a finger to say ""just a minute"" and headed on over to reception. I told the guy, ""I'm leaving and I don't want you to charge me."" He was shocked and apologetic, but I just hurried on out of there. It was such a weird experience and I wasn't going to waste my money by staying there. I realize I could have said something to the masseuse, but I was feeling so awkward about the situation, and I didn't know what to say. ""Uhh could you do a better job?""",False,False

I yelled after them to let them know I would be calling the cops and I got a photo. I told them not to go too far. I started dialing the non emergency hotline. And informed the operator of the incident. The kids kept saying that I need to take a joke. And that they were sorry. I didnt really care for the apologies. The cops arrived fairly quickly.

1,"WIBTA for restricting my daughter’s phone usage for, among other things, constantly talking to her dad? | No disclaimers, no apologies, let’s get right into it. 

I’m one of those parents who got their 10 year old a phone mainly for stuff like getting a hold of her after school in case pickup plans change and other emergencies. 

Her dad and I are separated and I am married to her stepdad which is all fine, it’s amicable. I have her weekdays and he has her every weekend. 

Predictably, my daughter uses her phone a lot, mainly for YouTube - she doesn’t have any kind of social media - and texting her one other friend who has a phone. Her usage has been a little over the top, I rarely see her without the thing in her hand but one of the reasons I am feeling like IWBTA for restricting her use is because she uses it to communicate with her dad. 

A lot. 

He texts her constantly and vice versa and calls her in the morning and at night and they’re on the phone for 30 mins to 2 hours on average. This is constantly interfering with stuff like trying to get her off to school on time, getting her to eat dinner, bed etc. I’ve talked to her dad about it and asked him only to call at certain times and to try not to keep her on the phone for too long for those reasons, but there are other reasons I am concerned. 

Despite our separation and the fact she spends the week with me and weekends with him, my daughter has always been more attached to her dad. Like, slept in bed with him til she was about 7, wouldn’t sleep on her own at his place unless he camped out on the floor, that kind of stuff. It got better between 8 years old and now, but then I got her the phone and while I have no problem her using it to keep in touch with him I’m concerned about the over-attachment again. 

I totally get that it’s normal for kids of separated parents to have separation anxiety and all kinds of fixation issues and what not but I’m concerned that getting the phone has made it worse again. So WIBTA for restricting her phone use, including telling her she can’t stay on the phone for hours with her dad? Or is this normal and am I overreacting? I know I am probably TA for getting her a phone in the first place and not anticipating these kinds of problems, but I’d love some perspective.",False,False
0,"AITA for not letting a 12 year old boy walk over me(15m)? | so this happened earlier today and here’s a little backstory. the kid in question is my cousin but we see each other maybe 2 times a year, so not the closest. LETS CALL HIM JIM. jim has sort of a rich kid personality, meaning that’s he feels that he should just win everything and life should be super easy for him. jim also has a pretty nasty attitude. 

he’s maybe 5’2 or 5’3, so he’s about 7-8 inches shorter than me and he’s  pretty athletic. he plays basketball and i don’t ever really play it outside of the random pickup game. 

so we were playing basketball and the game called H.O.R.S.E. for a little bit. at first, i was letting him win since he was younger than me, but then he started talking trash that would make most people who talk trash look weak in that sense. so i stopped letting jim win and he was not happy about that. he started to throw the ball as hard as he could at me whenever it was my turn to shoot. i was letting him slide on that for a bit, until he actually starts to yell at me to let him win and some other stuff along the lines of that. 

jim then suggests that we play a 2 on 2, me and my dad vs him and his dad. this is where the AITA is. 

jim hasn’t cooled down since the game of H.O.R.S.E. and he just stays that way for the rest of the night. as i said earlier, i’m 3 years older and a little over half a foot taller than him. he starts to body me hard, as in playing super aggressive and trying to shove me. this goes on for about 5-6 minutes before i start to body him back. and before i did this, i told him, “ if you keep playing like this, i’m going to play like that “ , so he knows what will happen if he doesn’t stop playing hyper aggressive. 

i take it from the top and start to dribble backwards towards the goal, protecting the ball form jim. he eventually hits his face onto my elbow and shoves me forward. i again, let it slide. i keep telling him to stop playing so aggressive and he doesnt stop. so i uphold my promise and start to play like him. 

i sprint down the court and run right into his left shoulder, moving him away. he gets all mad, but he’s not hurt. so the next time i have the ball and he’s playing right up on me, i basically jump into him, knocking him right into his back. the games ends shortly after that and on the car ride home, my dad tells me that i was a dick for doing that but i tell him that he was trying to act like a big boy who could play like that and that i wasn’t the a-hole for that. 

now i will admit, maybe that wasn’t the best thing to do, but as stated in the title, i wasn’t just gonna let him walk over me like that. 

so AITA for doing that?

0,"AITA for walking out on my mother’s birthday dinner | This has been bothering me for awhile so I hoped to get some insight from reddit. Obligatory mobile warnings do throwaway.

Some context: I have been diagnosed with c-PTSD for the last 3.5 years, mainly stemming from abuse and neglect from my immediate family. My parents are both doctors (psychiatrist and retired ER doc), both have been aware of my diagnosis and treatment for at least that long.

Last month was my mother’s 65th birthday, the family reserved a table at a really nice restaurant and invited the immediate family as well as our respective SOs. My bf came along but no other SOs had the time to attend. Nonetheless, being with my family in a public setting makes me extremely anxious and I often have to leave to go to a private area in order to practice breathing techniques, etc. I left once about an hour in after a few drinks, was gone for 10 minutes and returned- everything was going fine and the family was reminiscing, it was actually extremely pleasant.

That is until my twin turns to me and says the exact words ‘hey do you remember when we tortured you-?’ In a joking manner. Though I am sure it was a joke, they were referring to when my family would essentially push me to clean up dog shit in an alley beside our house- the smell was so awful it would make me throw up multiple times (which I would have to clean up as well) and so on and so forth. My brain immediately shut down and I retreated to the bathroom with my bf at the table. He texted me asking if I wanted to leave and - due to the fact I was on the verge of a panic attack or something equally awful - I agreed. My father followed my bf out of the restaurant and immediately started berating me in public for not acting more respectfully, when I tried to explain to him I needed to leave he simply told me I was full of shit (he’d been doubtful of my diagnosis from the start) to which I told him to fuck off quite loudly which got the attention of nearby people. I left quickly and he retreated into the restaurant. We have been on thin ice with one another since. I apologized to my mother and she was extremely understanding, which I appreciate immensely.

I later attempted to explain to him via text but he simply demanded an apology, this man is also the psychiatrist.

AITA for reacting that way to my father?

Tonight we were talking and out of the blue she asked me about her. I said that she was a bit shy, red hair, and absolutely the kindest person I knew. I then said you remind me a bit of her in that way, meaning that my girlfriend is also kind.

1,"AITA for telling my colleague that no one at office likes him? | So this happened just this morning and I'll have to deal with the consequences of it soon.

&#x200B;

The dynamics in my office are pretty strange. My position is Marketing Manager but I'm the only one in the Marketing department. I work with a couple other Managers but I mainly report to the Managing Director (MD).

&#x200B;

There's a particular Manager (R) who is seen by many in the office as ""difficult"" to work with. He's one of the newly promoted managers and tends to boss people around alittle bit and assert his authority.

&#x200B;

When he was promoted, I had to work with him on a couple of projects. After a couple of issues, I spoke to MD who told me I should let R make the final decisions as my role is to advise them and it is up to their discretion if they want to follow it.

&#x200B;

A couple months went by without any issues untill there was a big renovation project. I was tasked with liasing with the designers and contractors to unsure that everything went smoothly and was in line with the company's branding.

&#x200B;

R approaches me at the last minute and tells me he needs a special wall-feature to be added in. I told him the budget is pretty tight but I'll make it work.

&#x200B;

I had to attend a training course so I had limited access to my email however had my phone with me to answer important calls and messages. During the course, I managed to speak to the designer who told me his schedule was tight but he would try to install R's wall feature in 3 days.

&#x200B;

On the last day of the course, R texted me 

R: Where have you been. Why are you not in office. I need my wall feature up ASAP

Me: I've been at a training course. But I've spoken to the contractors who will get it done. Tentative date for installation is in 3 days.

R: I want a confirmed date, that doesn't sound convincing.

&#x200B;

The next day, I was back at office. R comes up to me and in a pretty loud voice, tells me I need to let him know about my whereabouts at all time because I'm working for him.

&#x200B;

I was alittle annoyed because he did this in front of a number of employees instead of talking to me in his/my room (Felt like he wanted to display his authority). I told him I don't report to him. If he's looking for me he could talk to MD who always knows where I am.

&#x200B;

He tells me that doesn't matter and it is my responsibility to update him. He also adds in a quip ""Not all managers are equal in this office""

&#x200B;

I was getting really frustrated and I told him not to throw his authority around as no one in the office respects him. They only listen to him because he was promoted and that's the reason he always has lunch alone.

&#x200B;

He glares at me and then walks away.

0,"AITA For Asking Why Someone Was Playing Their Music Outloud in the Gym? | So, I think I may be TA simply for how I approached the situation, but I am curious.

I was working out at my gym, and while working out I heard loud music through my headphones which usually eliminate distractions. After taking off my headphones and doing a couple more sets, it became apparent that a lady on the other side of the wait room was blasting music out loud from her phone. After 10 minutes of this, I decided to go talk to her as it was quite distracting to me.

I walked up to her and initially asked if she knew the music was playing out loud, as I honestly have accidentally played music out loud thinking my headphones were plugged in before. She said yes, and that she was listening to her workout playlist. I then told her that it was very distracting to other gym goers, and frankly she was being very inconsiderate by playing her music out loud. She got quite quiet and didn't really say anything in response to that. I then offered to buy her headphones (hence, why I think I may have acted as an asshole in this as it could be seen as condemning), and she said no and quickly walked away.

1,"AITA for not telling this girl I'm a janitor? | \*\*\*This happened early March, but it’s been lingering my mind. I need closure.\*\*\*

&#x200B;

So I (33M) go to Starbucks every morning to get an ever so delicious Tall Salted Caramel Mocha. Oh does it taste different at 5:47 am. Every morning when I go, I see this one girl. We are almost the only people here, that’s partly the only reason I noticed her. And she was pretty. Now here’s some background. I’m an average sized male. 5’5. My friend group is very tall, probably for an average of 5-8. This doesn’t help my confidence, my confidence lacks tremendously, but for some reason I grew the courage to talk to this girl. It wasn’t no more than 5 minutes into the conversation where the convo went into her asking why I was at Starbucks. I said, “well, I work at a lawfirm in downtown.”. We continued the conversation for 5 more minutes, I ended up getting her number and headed towards work.  We text for a week, eventually getting a bit more serious. I take her to RPM Steak in downtown Chicago, we had a ball. Well I did, can’t speak for her. Everything gets very serious, we talk for 2 weeks more, and she still thinks I’m a lawyer for some reason.   Another week blows by, and she had to be picked up from work. She works at a local college. I agreed to pick her up, but it was directly after work for me. I pick her up, and she looks at me weird. I ask her what’s up, she said “why are you wearing janitor clothes?” I responded with a simple, “because I’m a janitor”. I also said this with a lot of sass, because it was an obvious question she already had the answer to. So I could admit I was probably wrong in that. I took a bunch of verbal assault for about the next 15 minutes driving her home. Essentially, she said, that I’m an asshole for lying to her about where I work. I calmly reminded her law firms don’t clean themselves and not once did I claim I was a lawyer. I would never lie to a female about my job as a janitor. She took the ride home, and took my heart as she blocked me off Facebook, iPhone, and even PlayStation network off her brothers account (I messaged him to have her respond to me).

A said they should have one of the rooms while 9 of us would share the other. I told her they should be paying more then since it's a bit unfair to split the bill when one room is not enough to house 9 people.

I decided to keep our daughter after I found out I was pregnant as I was previously told it was next to impossible for me to conceive with my ex-husband.

We live in a very nice and expensive area that I wouldn’t be able to afford by myself. I needed a place to live after quitting my job and no longer being able to afford my apartment, after telling him he asked me to move in with him. I must admit I was a little uneasy moving in with him at first, but so far everything has been going well. I cook and clean for him whenever he’s at home, which is about 3 days a week, and in return I get to live here rent free and spending money that is equal to my previous wage. We have now been living together for 18 months.

I have access to all the rooms in the house bar the gym. This wasn’t a problem for me as I previously used my local gym with his sister (35f), then I was pregnant, so I didn’t need to go gym. Recently I have decided its time to lose the baby weight and start going to gym again, when I mentioned to him that I would like the access code to the garage he asked why and after telling him I want to use the gym he refused. When I asked him why he said that there’s thousands of dollars of equipment in the gym that he doesn’t want me to use in case I damage it and that its pretty dangerous as he has a lot of car parts and tools lying around, I got pretty mad and kind of shouted at him that when I moved in we agreed I have total access to all rooms but now he’s refusing me access to the garage, its pretty stupid that just he thinks I might damage his equipment even though I’ve been lifting weights way longer than he has and that I can take care of myself. 

I feel kind of conflicted as I know that I’m in the right, but it is his house and I am grateful of the relationship we have and all he’s done for me, but I feel as if all my life I’ve been told no or you can’t do so and so and I thought he was different.

We haven’t spoken about anything other than our daughter for the last week, I haven’t cooked or cleaned for him as well as I feel that if he doesn’t hold up his end, I shouldn’t hold up mine. So far, he is avoiding me and spends most of his time in the garage.

Fast forward to this morning when I found a printout of instructions from a clinic on preparing for a vasectomy procedure. I immediately confront him about this and he said that he forgot to tell me that he's getting a vasectomy next week. I immediately flipped out and demanded to know why he didn't think it was important to discuss this with me. He said it was his body and his decision, and to which I said yea ok but you really haven't considered my needs at all in this. I told him that getting irreversable surgeries like vasectomies are incredibly irresponsible since he'll never know if he'll change his mind about it and that he was being an impulsive child. He said that since he and I are both environmentally conscious we should be against having kids but that I just hadn't 'come around to realizing it yet', which made me really go WTF. I basically told him that if he was really going to go through with this then we were over since he making a life changing decision that would affect our relationship forever and stormed out.

1,"AITA for refusing to exchange my vegan meal for my ex’s GF’s meat option? | I [25F] dated my boyfriend [23M] for 6 months. Before that, he dated this girl [19F] for 2 years. She broke up with him last year but I always suspected he was obsessed with her and I was right.

Two weeks ago, he broke up with me out of the blue, and decided to get back together with his ex. It came completely out of left field.

We were supposed to attend his cousin’s wedding together as a couple. The wedding occurred on Saturday, and he took his girlfriend instead. All 3 of us were supposed to attend the wedding anyways (meaning we each got invited individually), but I was just supposed to be seated next to him. However, our seats were switched so that I sat at her original place so she could sit next to him.

I had ordered a meat option originally when mailing back the RSVP. My ex-boyfriend’s girlfriend is vegan, though. When the meals came, there must have been a mix up because she got the beef dish that I ordered while I got a vegan dish that she must have ordered. 

I honestly didn’t mind. Before I could eat it though, she came over and asked if we could switch meals. She didn’t touch the beef dish either.

I said no, I didn’t feel like switching because the vegan dish actually looks a lot better than the beef one. She asked if I was serious. I said yeah, sorry, I don’t want to switch. I suggested she go approach the kitchen for another plate.

However as it turns out, only 9 guests in total ordered the vegan option and the caterer ran out of the main course. So unfortunately she just ended up eating some ice berg lettuce with a few pieces of tomato and cucumbers but no dressing because it’s not vegan.

0,"AITA for staring at a wall during a date? | I (19F) went out on a dinner date with a guy (24M). I’m pretty inexperienced when it comes to dating, so I was pretty nervous. While we were waiting for our food, the conversation between the two of us fell flat and I couldn’t think of any other topics to bring up.

I was always taught that it’s rude to just stare at someone without reason, so my eyes kind of just directed themselves towards the wall adjacent to our table during this period of awkward silence. It’s important to note that he didn’t try to start up a new conversation, either.

Then he told me, “You seem to be really interested in that wall...” with an annoyed tone. He seemed to be upset that I wasn’t talking to him but luckily, our food arrived and I began talking about the food, I guess.

When we were finishing up, the restaurant got louder and louder (it was a bar restaurant) and I couldn’t hear what he was saying. So I repeatedly asked, “What?” In a relatively loud voice and he sighed and told me that I was being annoying.

0,"AITA for feeding my sons vegan friend meat? | Hey guys, short time lurker first time poster, I'm not one to really do this but I'm genuinely wondering if I'm in the wrong.


So my son had a friend over for dinner the other night. For context, they're both 13, and the friends parents are vegan.


I don't know anything about vegan food and don't have many vegetables I normally cook - pretty much all I ever make for vegetable sides is buttered corn, brocolli and cheese, brown sugar carrots, or mixed veggies.


Well, normally his friend isn't over for dinner, but this night his parents weren't able to pick him up until late so asked if he could eat dinner with us. We said of course, and they reminded us that they are vegan so he'd need a vegan friendly dish. We told them we don't really have anything we could make vegan, but we could find some small things to give him until they picked him up and they said to just make whatever we were going to make ourselves and leave out the animal products.


Well, that night was meatloaf night. With homemade mashed potatoes (lots of butter) and buttered corn. I offered to make him some roasted carrots and potato wedges, but he said he'd actually like to eat what we were eating and that it looked good, and that he usually eats meat at school anyways. So, we just made him the same plate as ours. 


Well when his parents asked him what he had for dinner and he told them, they were PISSED. They said we're a bad influence and turning him against veganism?? Even though it was HIS choice to eat our dinner rather than me making him some small sides. Apparently now he's also no longer allowed to hang out with our son. Our son is heartbroken, me and my husband are pretty upset that they're trying to end our kids friendship over this, and our friends are kind of split. Some people say that their son is old enough to make his own decision on if he's vegan or not, some think I should of done as the parents asked and made him something vegan. I also think that at his age, it's his choice to eat animal products or not, and if he asks me for some I'm not going to say no. So what's reddit's judgement, who's in the wrong here?",False,False
0,"AITA for being mad at my mom for not dropping off Thanksgiving dinner to me? | Long time lurker, first time poster. Forgive the formatting, posting on mobile. 

I just came home from a long weekend away with my family visiting my sister and and BIL, and caught a nasty cold from my (adorable) nephew. I have been working while being sick since I got back, not wanting to request more PTO/sick time immediately after returning from vacation. I usually work 10-12 hour shifts that can go until late at night and spend that time mostly on my feet and being very active. Thanksgiving is my only day off for another week and so I decided to opt out of Thanksgiving dinner to rest at home alone. 

That being said, my mom graciously offered to bring me a plate since I wouldn’t be able to make it to enjoy the feast. She wasn’t in charge of cooking or cleaning this year as my aunt was hosting, and I live on her way home from my aunts house, so it didn’t seem like a huge imposition when she volunteered to drop it by after dinner. Throughout the day I declined a few other offers to have food dropped off to me by other friends in the area knowing I had my own family favorites to look forward to. 

At around 10pm I find myself fighting to stay awake, hungry and beyond ready to enjoy my dinner. I start reaching out to my mom and offer to come by and pick the food up myself so I could eat and go to sleep. She apologizes as she has gotten pretty drunk and stayed later than she intended, but says they are leaving soon and will be by in 20 to drop off the food. An hour later I call again to offer to just pick it up as I am starving and really exhausted at this point and she again says not to come by and she will be right over. At 12:30 I tried calling and texting her that I was going to sleep and was disappointed not to get the chance to eat Thanksgiving dinner despite my multiple offers to come get it myself. She stopped answering and ignored the rest of my attempts to get a hold of her. 

I’m pissed. My mom has been prioritizing drinking over a lot of things lately and I’m ready to confront her about it, especially now that I’ve been completely forgotten tonight. I don’t think I’m being unreasonable but I can’t tell if I’m just being overly sensitive and bratty because I feel like shit or if I have a legitimate reason to be upset with her. AITA?",False,False
1,"WIBTAH if I gave my unused Oxycodone to my boyfriend for his head trauma pain after an accident because no one in his city will prescribe opiates? | I (f) had a ton of pain in my abdomen and in my back suddenly yesterday. I thought it was maybe food poisoning from eating at a breakfast place so I took pepto bismol and waited it out but by this morning at 3am it had gotten to where I felt like I was having a baby, the pain was like torture. At 6am I drove myself to the hospital emergency room. (I live alone). They gave me morphine for my pain in the hospital which helped with pain but only partially. 

But anyway they took scans and I was told I had a kidney stone. The doctor said I had to wait to see if it would pass on it own so I left and went and filled my prescription for oxycodone and a no-nausea pill. 

I get home and within a few hours passed the stone. I feel fine now. I had not needed to use any of the oxycodones because the meds I got in the hospital were still in me and I didn't want to overlap them.

Relevant fact: Neither myself nor my boyfriend have ever taken opiates before and we are not drug addicts.

Now to my dilemna: My boyfriend ""Ray"" is an avid bicyclist and he had an accident on his bike 2 years ago. He suffered a concussion and fractured his facial bones. 

His biggest issue is his head pain. He has seen numerous doctors and there is nothing anyone can do. They prescribe a mild non opiate med but it doesn't help much. The pain is so bad that all he does is cry and complain about how he wishes he was dead. But doctors in his city won't prescribe him opiates which would give him a better quality of life. 

He had so much documentation by doctors that he got full disability on his first try. He is the type who can't sit home so he still rides but is much more careful and rides slower than before. His head pain is constant and he is so sad and down all the time. He is also angry, not at anyone in particular, just angry that he isn't the same man he was before.

I want to give him him my oxycodones. It would make him feel better for a short time until they run out but it would be so nice to see him happy again for a moment.

1,"AITA For taking away a hs seniors volunteers hours that he needs? | I work at a summer camp as the head leader for little children (max age 12) and we have hs volunteers who help us out.

We have this one intern who is super lazy and never does any work, honestly it would make me mad if he was getting paid, but its just hours so whatever.

We were having an activities time and lo and behold, the lazy intern wasnt doing anything, when we started to play basketball he became extremely interested. We have speakers in the office and he asked if he could play music. I told him it's not for him but he can play some music for the kids. I told him he can basically play anything that doesn't have swearing, I thought that was easy enough.

He told me he would play a playlist that he has that he made specifically for something like this. I left to do some paperwork and when I came back he was blasting the most profane music that was a mix of like metal and rock. On top of that I saw all the kids just sitting on the sides of the gym, wandering around in the halls, and doing things unsupervised while the lazy ass intern was playing 1 on 1 with another volunteer.

I told him to come to my office, where I had a long talk with him. He constantly rolled his eyes and looked around the room. Finally I told him that he could leave and not to come back. He then said 

""I honestly couldnt care less, you've signed my volunteer hours and thats all I need for the coming school year.""

He left, but before doing so, he turned on his bluetooth and blasted a song that had like 5 swear words for every 5 seconds the song played.

I noticed he left his volunteer hours sheet which had upwards of 30+ hours on it, I took one look at it and ripped it up and thought nothing of it.

While I was closing up I noticed he was trying to get inside the building begging for his hours back. He told me that he needed it because he was gonna be taking night classes on top of a full schedule during his final year in hs, and it will be near impossible to get them during the school year.

His parents called, and my supervisors and a lot of people who heard about what I did called me an asshole, quite frankly I feel like it was a bit harsh, but he basically did nothing for the time he's been working at our summer camp, and I don't think he deserves to have them at all, so AITA?",False,False

I was, seemingly cutting my fingers off with a plastic knife before rolling it up and setting it on fire, and of course, the finger magically grew back. The children laughed and cheered as usual, but afterwards a lady relative(One of my distant cousin, I guess? Too many, can’t remember them all) approached me and asked me to not perform “dangerous"" tricks using things like knives and fire.

She said it encourage dangerous behaviours in children, especially her daughter who is only 5. She was worried that the she may try copy my tricks and play with fire and knives and hurt herself in the process. I admit, I never quite put much thought to that, but can’t say it doesn’t hurt when one have put effort to perform and being told off like that, and her tone attracted a few other adults to look in our direction. It’s one thing for children, but I get rather nervous when adults start to stare. It’s very embarrassing.

After some quick thinking I apologized in the most dramatic way possible, made a very big apologetic  bow towards her, raising and twisting my voice in a funny way, made a face before snapping my head to the side with a “crack” sound as if its broken(it’s just a popper). The children, who were confused at first, started to laugh, and it seemed to ease the tension in the atmosphere.

The lady relative wasn’t the least bit impressed though, she looked more embarrassed than I was earlier, and obviously angrier at me. Oh well, I made a slip and got out before she could confront me again.

My SIL said, “I’ve never watched any Marvel movies. They seem pretty awful.” I was pissed off, I don’t get why my SIL, an adult woman, feels the need to be so rude and dismissive towards a teenager. I said loudly, “shut up, not everything has to be about you and what you like.” She blushed and didn’t say anything more, my brother didn’t say anything either.

1,"AITA for kicking my mom out of my house for bringing non-vegan wine to my vegan Christmas dinner? | My wife and I have a tradition of hosting a vegan Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner each year for our vegan and vegetarian friends. We live in an area where such a thing is seen by many people with ridicule and contempt, so we want to be able to let our friends and ourselves enjoy a proper Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner.

My mom asked me if she could come to our Thanksgiving dinner this year since she now lives alone, so I of course said yes. She asked us to make some turkey, and I told her no because everybody else at the dinner will be vegan or vegetarian, and so we will be keeping it vegan.

On Thanksgiving day, she decided to show up several hours early and *bring with her a turkey, which she said that she was going to bake in our oven*. We said absolutely not, and that we do not want any meat in our house. She had to bring the turkey back to her house and come back for dinner. During the dinner, she started whining about the food and making bizarre remarks about veganism in general, making everybody else uncomfortable. I pulled her aside to another room during the dinner, telling her that she needs to be more respectful. The rest of the dinner went fine after that.

She asked to come to our Christmas dinner as well, so I told her to please *not* bring any food or drink. She disregarded my request and decided to bring a bottle of wine. I looked up that particular wine on Barnivore, *only to find out that the wine is not vegan*. I told her to please leave, and that she will not be invited back anytime soon.

She was very upset and apologetic, telling me that she did not know that there was such a thing as non-vegan wine. I do believe her; however this was her second chance and she disregarded my *very simple request* to not bring *any* food or drink.

1,"WIBTA for contacting an old friend to make amends without telling my fiancee? | For anonymity, names will be changed.

A little backstory. around 6 years ago. When my now fiancee and I first started dating, i was best friends with a girl (Sarah) for about 10 years. I had been single for a long time, so i was excited for them to meet. I previously had feelings for Sarah, although I was clearly friend zoned, we had slept together once a few years prior. I was upfront and told my fiancee about this before they met, and she was fine with it. we all met in a pub, and they both got on incredibly well. It was a great night to start with. We were drinking, making jokes at my expense and I was so happy that they were getting along so well. At one point towards the end of the night, my fiancee went to the bathroom, and it was just me and Sarah sat at the table. Sarah told me about how she was going to break up with her boyfriend and needed a place to stay for a while. I said that it was fine with me, but I would need to run it past my fiancee so she didn't think things would get weird. She then added that she wouldn't be able to afford to pay rent but could ""pay me in other ways"" - I was pissed off, but just ended up ignoring the comment and moving on to something else.

I didn't want to ruin anyone's night, so i didn't say anything at the time, but I had decided that for my relationship to work I couldn't be friends with her anymore. Partly because of how strongly i felt about Sarah for so long and i was scared that I might do something I would regret, and partly because I couldn't stand that she would try to use me like that without caring about my fiancee at all. The next morning, I told my fiancee everything. and she was also pissed. At the end of it all my fiancee and I fell out with Sarah and we haven't spoken since.

Now, my fiancee and I have been together for nearly 6 years, and last month i proposed. things are moving quickly, and we have set a date to get married in 2021. I honestly couldn't be happier with my current life, but that moment when Sarah and my fiancee met has always bothered me and made me feel guilty. I've been thinking that I would like to start this new chapter in our lives fresh, and without any regrets about the past, so I've been considering finding Sarah on Facebook and sending her a message to tell her that as far as I'm concerned, I no longer hold any kind of resentment and to wish her well in her life and just leave it at that. I'm not even expecting a reply or anything, it's just something I want to do to make myself feel better. I just want to clear the air and my conscience. even though when i think about it logically I know I have nothing to feel bad about. I'm not sure how to approach this conversation with my fiancee, as whenever I mention Sarah she will go off on a rant about how she can't believe she would do what she did, and I don't want her to get the wrong impression so i was thinking about just sending a message and then telling/showing her afterwards.

Flash forward (18) and my best friend leaves for the marines. His mom asks for my number to sign me up for the school’s (she works at and I now attend) new “alert system.”  I think nothing of it and give her my number.

This is where things get weird. The “alert system” went from messaging me about school events to asking me to attend a movie. I confront her and she admits she was forwarding me the notifications using her number and never signed me up. I go to the movies because she’s 50+ I’m 18 and she said we would go as friends.

1,"WIBTA for cutting a close friend off for choosing work over my wedding? | This is something I've been thinking about for months now and I need some help. I apologize for how messy all of this is.


I have a friend who I've been close with since junior year of high school. He is a musician and a member in a pretty mainstream band and is currently touring. While I've (obviously) seen him less and less over the years due to his success, we do still talk on an occasion and I see him when he's in town. I am honestly nothing but happy for him and I want nothing but the best for him. But I'd also like for him to be a good friend and I feel like that's the exact opposite of what he's doing.


I'm getting married in October. I asked my friend shortly after I proposed if he would be one of my groomsmen, and he agreed. Official invitations went out early last month, but my wedding date has been publicly known for over a year and a half due to its significance. He knows and has known the day I'm getting married since then. 


In mid-May he told me he didn't know if he would be able to be in my wedding because of touring. I was pretty upset then but he said he would try to figure something out. I won't pretend to know how far in advance he would've found this out, but he told me before the tour was officially announced so in my mind I had at least a little hope that he would still be able to be in the wedding. We texted back and forth a few times after that in the weeks following but never about my wedding, and he fell off a bit due to work.


Then last month the tour was officially announced and my wedding date is one of tour dates. I was LIVID and called him and left a message asking him to call me as soon as he could. He called like two days later and when I confronted him he told me that there was nothing he could do and that this was a sacrifice for both of us. I pushed him more and he got extremely short and shitty with me and said that he ""didn't have time or energy to deal with this right now"" and hung up. 


To be honest I'm mostly upset that he didn't tell ME before the tour was officially announced that he absolutely 100% would not be able to make it. I texted him a couple weeks ago and asked him one more time if there was ANY way he could still make it and he replied that he was sorry, but no, it just wasn't possible. I haven't spoken to him since. 


I understand how busy and stressful his life must be, and I also understand that sacrifices sometimes need to be made, but this just has me feeling really shitty about myself and our friendship. I feel like I matter way less to him than he does to me. I was at his wedding and pretty much nothing would have prevented me from attending it, and especially not work. I don't want to lose his friendship but I also don't want this to be the first of many times he lets me down.

1,"WIBTA for not sharing my kid's winter clothes with my ex? | I know how it sounds. I'm struggling with this. 

I'm the parent of a 2 year old child. Over the last year I've fought through a fairly high conflict divorce and custody fight. The process was ugly but custody and placement is shared 50/50. The court orders require that expenses related to the child are to be split 50/50. Expenses greater than $100 must have the consent of both parties before being undertaken otherwise it becomes the sole responsibility of the purchasing parent.  

I live in an area known for long and cold winter weather. Approximately a month and a half ago I approached my ex about setting up our child with winter clothing while it was readily available. They hemmed and hawwed and eventually came up with a hand me down coat that was already a size too small. It is usable now but will not last the winter.  We were still without boots, mittens,  and snow pants.  

Within the last week temperatures have dropped sharply and we've received our first snows. It could not be put off any longer so I purchased the needed clothing. Hat, mittens, properly fitting coat, boots and snow pants.  The total expense was under $100.  When I presented the receipts to my ex, the refused to pay for their half of the expenses, citing a lack of funds. I am not insensitive to that,  and suggested that they pay me back over the winter as they're able. They refused, stating they didn't have the money and it didn't matter if they paid me or not- the clothes were already purchased. 

I was put off by this- the tone and tenor of the conversation was very much along the lines of ""what will you do about it? Let the child without on my weeks?"" I was further put off because difficult winters are no surprise here, and despite the proclamations of no money, my ex smokes nearly a pack of cigarettes a day and routinely posts about frequent nights out at bars on social media. I don't want to police their spending but claiming no money for necessary childhood expenses while spending heavily on vices sits badly with me. 

The small coat my ex got their hands on will be sufficient for weekly exchanges and trips to the store- little else. It would truly be a barest of minimums until the child grows out of it. Family and friends are suggesting I keep my proper winter clothes for myself for use during my placement weeks while leaving the option open to pay half and fully share when and if me ex comes to their senses. Part of me feels the same, but I worry that though I am actively being taken advantage of, I would be TA by knowingly subjecting my child to the bare minimum half of the time.

I'm the adult responsible for her)? | I don't post often to Reddit but lurk a lot. I guess I need some help here because I may be overreacting based on my past and what I've seen my sister go through with the ""wrong"" sort of male attention.

My grandparents are paying for a mostly all included vacation to a California beach town. I don't know the final count but I think about 20 people will eventually be here. My husband and I are both between jobs and called the Airbnb host and asked if there was a way we could extend the stay either before or after at a discount or in exchange for work. Host was so cool and when we told her my husband can install flooring she's letting us stay for two weeks in exchange for the install (so we will be here 3 total weeks, one week with family). My aunt heard about this and asked if my cousin might be able to come with us since she just broke up with a boyfriend and was moping around the house all summer. I thought the company would be awesome since my cousin and I are relatively close in are (22 and 17) and my husband would be busy. 

We got here Friday and husband got to work and cousin and I hit the beach. She took off her beach dress and holy shit...she had on the most revealing swimsuit I've ever seen. It was essentially a g-string bottom and the top some how had cleaveage with side boob AND underboob. I asked her if her mom knew and she said what her mom doesn't know won't hurt her. I asked her where she even found such a swimsuit and she told me Instagram. I sat there uncomfortable for about an hour as she flipped back and forth to get sun and every time she did she just got more and more attention from guys.  We went to get some food and she walked up the beach as if it was nothing but when I saw a real creep taking pictures I knew I had do step in. I told her had to go back to the house and talk. 

I told her that when her mom gets here she can wear whatever she wants but I have to be an adult here. I asked her if she had other swimsuits and she said yes. These weren't the dental floss she'd been wearing but still total thong and way too much boobage for my comfort. I told her no way but I'd be happy to take her shopping and get her somthing more appropriate.

Now I know what it's like to have a teenager pissed at me. She's basically locked herself in her room, only comes out to get takis and grapefruit and sneers at me like I killed her pet. She won't go to the beach or sea world with me. She has said to my husband that she thought I wouldn't be as lame as her mom and her two weeks is ruined.

1,"AITA for making a friend of mine feel stupid for being excited about a ""gift"" he received from his employer of 8 years? | So ""Jesse""(m42) and I(m37) have been friends for going on 20 years. I'm the entrepreneurial type, he's the just keep your head down and work hard and the American dream will automatically come type. Jesse has 3 jobs. He works at a car wash during the day, then parks trucks for UPS, then finishes off most his nights doing valet for a restaurant.

 The car wash is the 8-year gig. Jesse works hard asf. He's never late, never calls in sick, always down to come in on his days off if he's called in. Super trooper for real. The problem is, his starting wage was $7.25/hr....fast forward 8 years he now makes $8.15/hr. To add insult to injury the employees must split tips. And since washing cars is such a menial profession he's the 42-year-old working hard to survive while surrounded by co-workers who are mostly fuck ups or high school kids on break who just don't care. 

He's the workhorse and his employers take advantage of it full tilt. If he wants a day off to go check out the Bengals(his fave team) he damn near has to beg. When he's tried to bring up raises in the past management manipulates him into thinking his requests are non-sensical. Almost every day he tells me the BS he has to deal with from managers and co-workers and almost every day I tell him how he deserves better and should look for better but he kind of shuts down when I make these suggestions.

 So a couple days ago he comes to my place all smiles and suuuper excited. Like ""bro, guess what happened at work."" I'm thinking ohhhh shit, this mf finally got a raise. He tells me that their busy as all hell when the owner pulls up and gets out of his car looking pissed as fire. As soon as he gets out he points at Jesse and orders him over to the car, hands on his waist pacing back and forth clearly irritated. According to Jesse he literally runs over to the owners car. When Jesse gets over there, the owner switches up and begins to explain how much he appreciates Jesse for his hard work and YEARS of dedication to the business.

 The owner then tosses Jesse the keys to the car and pauses for a moment. Long enough of a moment to give Jesse the thought that the owner just gave him the car. The owner then chuckles and says nahhh I cant give you the beamer but I got you something else, open the trunk and check it out. Jesse takes the keys, opens up the trunk,(Again I'm thinking to myself like...it better be a kilo of bam bam or at least 3 mac book pros in that bitch) and feasts his eyes on...a mf'n air fryer.

 Jesse is telling me this shit like he's the luckiest dude in the world, and I, somewhat regrettably so begin to dismantle every bit of his excitement by describing how much of an insult and slap in the face this ""gift"" from his employer is. I'm telling him shit like ""you should've thrown that air fryer across the damn street and told him to go fuck himself"" etc etc. My rant probably lasted 3 minutes and at the end of it I look at his face and he looks embarrassed and somewhat ashamed. He's not looking at me while he say's ""well I thought it was pretty cool I really wanted one of those things"". I again go into explaining why he should feel disrespected and not appreciated until I snap out of it. Then he tells me maybe I'm right, followed by ""well I gotta get to my other job"" but I really feel like he just left because I shit all over his good day. What's your take? AITA

0,"AITA for caring too much about my daycare losing my daughters clothing? | My daughter is almost 5 months old and just started daycare about 3 weeks ago. I am the parent who gets her dressed in the morning and drops her off, my husband picks her up. On Wednesday evening, I noticed she came home in a spare set of her clothing. This isn't uncommon because she's a baby and they soil their clothes sometimes. However, my husband wasn't given the dirty clothing in a bag like usual. He wouldn't have known to ask for it because he's already at work by the time I dress her. 

&#x200B;

So the next morning (Thursday). I ask the teachers about her clothing, assuming they just didn't give it to my husband. First they questioned whether they actually changed her clothes. That bugged me because I was certain they did, since I remembered what I dressed her in. Next the lead teacher literally shrugs and says ""I guess we sent them home with someone else."" No apology or saying they'll pay better attention next time. The fact they sent them home with someone else isn't a huge deal, since baby clothes are cheap and also her clothes are labeled with her name. So there's a chance the parent who accidentally got them will return them. However, the teacher's casual response without an apology irritated me. Also, I had to ask if they'd mention it to other parents and she said she'd ""try to remember.""

&#x200B;

My husband arrives Thursday evening to pick up my daughter, and asks about the clothes at my request. the teachers never asked any of the other parents and still didn't apologize. Once again they simply admitted they must have sent the clothing home with someone else.

1,"WIBTA For Removing A Person From Our Social Group Who Do Not Blend In | We have a ladies-only social group in our neighborhood, 7 in all, and there is 1 of them who has always having trouble blending in, Jan. She is the youngest among us(20s). Her social media is full of pictures of cats, video games and cartoon. 

For group bonding I(37F) am usually the one organizing outings and travels, and usually Jan's opinions get passed because it does not go well with majority of us. For example, for traveling she would suggest beaches and amusement parks while most of us prefer shopping centres and sightseeing. As time pass by Jan had stopping giving opinions and just go with the flow.

Whenever we have outings Jan would also be the one carrying our bags as some of us would bring kids along. Despite being nice in general Jan has a rather low tolerance for children, and would visibly back off when the kids start making noise, which some of us, including me, find rude.

Not long ago Jan had an argument with one of the other ladies, Mira(40s). Unlike Mira and most of the other ladies, when Jan snap she started swearing and with a sharp tongue rapped a whole load of curses at Mira. The argument(too long a story) ended with Mira storming off and Jan pointing finger at her.

I called Jan up and had a talk with her. Jan told me that since she's usually a shut-in, she didn't mind joining us for outings as they are the only times she get social, if at all. However, she admitted having a hard time blending into the group as our age and likings differ too much and she couldn't enjoy herself.

I am considering removing Jan from the group as the other ladies are showing distaste towards her after the her argument with Mira, calling her immature and vulgar, and to top that off she dislike kids. Also, since Jan has already told me that she wasn't enjoying herself removing her may be for the better.",False,False
0,"AITA for threatening to quit my friend's podcast if he doesn't stop bringing his girlfriend on the show? | Me and my friend, Mark, have our own podcast dedicated to movies and entertainment. The podcast was his idea and he's more or less the main host, but I'm the co-host and we both appear on every episode, sometimes just the two of us and sometimes with other friends. But about a month ago, Mark brought in his girlfriend, Meg, and she added absolutely nothing to that episode. We were discussing the Phase 4 of MCU films and during our conversation, Meg just randomly interrupts and asks ""Is Batman in the MCU?"" The whole episode was just her asking really dumb questions like that and Mark had to explain to me that she doesn't really follow movies as close as we do. I asked him why he even brought her on, and he said ""She wanted to be on, so I said yes."" I even told him that our podcast would benefit from having guests who are more knowledgeable on movies and he said that he'll try to explain that to her.

Ever since then, she's been on every episode we've done and our podcast has been taking some heat for it. Comments have been left telling us that she's detrimental since she rarely knows what she's talking about and she always interjects with comments and questions that make no sense. For example, a few weeks ago we were talking about Hobbs and Shaw and Meg kept referring to Idris Elba as Chris Rock. We kept having to correct her and she said ""Didn't a movie with Chris Rock just come out?"" We had no clue what she was talking about and it was really frustrating. Whenever she's not making stupid comments, she's always interrupting with some non sequitur, like one time when she randomly asked if soup counts as a drink while we were discussing the new Zombieland 2 trailer.

But a couple of days ago is when things got ugly. Me, Mark, Meg, and a couple of other friends were on the show and we were suppose to be giving our thoughts on Ready or Not, but Meg seemed to be upping her interrupting, non sequitur game. I was trying to give my thoughts on the movie, but Meg was taking selfies and kept asking Mark what she thought of them. I was really trying to control myself, but she just kept interrupting me with questions like ""What's this movie even about?"" and ""Are we ever getting another Titanic movie?"" It reached a point where I was trying to talk and she interrupted by asking ""Have any of you guys ever been to Paris?"" I lost my temper and shouted ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" at her. And while we were still recording, Mark yells at me to not talk to her like that and I started yelling that I'm done with the show. 

I stormed out and called Mark later, telling him that I'm no longer going to be part of the podcast if he keeps bringing Meg on. I explained that she's affecting our views, but he said that she keeps asking to be on and he doesn't want to say no to her. I reiterated that I'm going to quit if he keeps letting Meg on and then he accuses me of ruining our podcast and that I'm ""going too far.""",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I suspend an employee for not coming to staff meetings? | I am the GM of a donut shop franchise. We live in a small coastal community and our town is on the tip-end of a peninsula.  We are at the end of the world here and getting to our town is kind of a hassle with only two ways in or out and both have long commute times. [Here is a Paint drawing of how my town is laid out.](https://imgur.com/a/Hbjt1j9) Let's call my town ""Donut Town"".

I have an employee (Hannah) who I hired about six months ago. Hannah lives two towns over from Donut Town in a place we'll call ""Hannahville"". Hannahville and Donut Town are separated by thirty miles or about forty-five minutes of drive time if you're coming from Hannahville. If you come from the only other road into town, its even longer. I saw Hannah at her previous job and liked her customer service abilities so I offered her a job.

I warned her that the commute to Donut Town is long and hellish and she would be held to the same standards as my other employees (who all live in Donut Town). On that note, she accepted the job and assured me she'd allow herself the proper time to get to work each day. She actually shows up early every day so I made a deal with her that I'd let her off a little early each day so she can avoid after-school traffic. It's working out nicely.

Each month we have a staff meeting in which myself, all of the assistant managers, the entire staff, and our store owners are required to be present. We discuss any news regarding the store, new sales, things being discontinued, and open the floor for employees to raise issues if need be. We have the meetings on the same Friday each month. Unfortunately that's also one of Hannah's days off. 

 I've tried to get our owners to move the staff meetings to a day that's more convenient for Hannah but the owners have refused to change the day because they own several other businesses they visit each month and changing our visit date would mean changing the other dates (which is kind of BS because all they'd have to is swap with another store, but I don't have the authority to tell them their business).

We clock in for these meetings, and we're paid to attend, it's on the employee schedule and I always announce it two weeks before it happens. And, just like a normal shift, absence and tardiness is penalized. One is a warning, two is a written warning, three is a write-up, four or more is my discretion. Hannah has missed six and every time I take her for a conversation she whines about having to drive an hour each way. My position is she knew the commute when she got hired, she's had no trouble on the days she works, she knows these meetings are required. She has missed all six meetings since she's been hired and currently has four write-ups. 

Would I be an asshole if I suspend her for a small period of time as punishment for continual tardiness/absence?",False,False

Discreetly as possible I got up to request they both join me.  My best man apologized and did so.  The other did join me, but then starts asking me in a really passive-aggressive manner whether or not it’d be ok upon completion of his meal (which he ate pretty quickly) to return to the table of mutual friends and his date.  I was pretty upset but for my bride’s sake I didn’t want to make a scene so I said ok.  He seemed more interested in glad handing and getting laid than being my groomsman.  It really hurt but honestly does he really need to be told how messed up and embarrassing that is?  Dinner is only so long then you get the whole dance to spend time with your date and mutual friends.

1,"AITA For not giving the 911 dispatcher my info? | As everyone knows, all modern smartphones have a built-in emergency call feature on the lock screen of the phone where you can call 911 even if the phone is locked. Mine is particularly sensitive. Day before yesterday my five year old got ahold of my phone and started playing on the lock screen. In addition to locking me out of my phone for an inconvenient period of time, my five year old also managed to call 911. I could hear 5 year old talking to someone so I came from the kitchen and took the phone, asked who was there, the caller identified as a 911 dispatcher for our county.

I apologized and explained that my kid had managed to dial them, we were fine, there was no emergency, it was a misdial and I would have a talk with my child about not playing with cellphones and not dialing 911. They asked for my address so they could send a squad out to check on me for verification.

I know they were just doing their jobs but I was about to leave for the afternoon, there wouldn't be anyone there, and we didn't need police assistance. I know misdials to 911 are annoying and often life-threatening in the event that all operators are taking calls but in the past when I've accidentally misdialed (back in the landline/primitive mobile phone days) they've just taken my name and hung up, no police were sent to my location. But this dispatcher kept pushing the issue. She really wanted to send a couple of cops to my residence.

Once again I explained to her that we were not having an emergency, there was no danger or medical emergency at my residence, we were perfectly fine, my child simply misused my unsupervised phone, and I would not accept having police sent to my residence. Then I hung up. They didn't call back, nor did anyone for the next few hours. Cops were never sent to my location.

Like I said, I know she was just doing her job but I had to tell her three or four times that it was my kid playing with my phone, they made a mistake, I would talk to them about misuse of phones, and it wouldn't happen again. When I mentioned this to my spouse they said I should have given our address to the dispatcher and let the cops come. I see that as a waste of the police department's valuable time.

And he basically always has guests (anywhere from 1 to up to around 8 and sometimes more) over. His girlfriend, his best friend, his friends, his friends friends, etc. I'm talking literally everyday, and it's annoying. 

They don't stay in the common areas, nearly always in his bedroom but it's not like having 2+ people in the apartment isn't unnoticeable. They often play loud music, video games and smoke inside. And having \*at least\* two extra voices really adds a lot of noise to the apartment. Sometimes they'll arrive in the morning and stay until midnight, and sometimes into the early morning. They're all nice people, but this is a shared apartment not his own clubhouse.  

He says that he has guests over to help with his anxiety, but honestly (and this is where I might be the asshole) I don't think thats a good excuse. He's also fine with travelling long distances by himself to work and back. And if he needs someone to be around for literally every one of his waking moments that he needs to see a doctor about it which he's not doing. He's also outspoken and argumentative.

1,"WIBTA If I told my roommate he shouldn't be paying so much for his kid? | Sorry if I fuck up formatting or anything I don't post often even on my main account. TLDR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

My friend and I moved into an apartment together around Jan 18. Around Jul 18 my roommate was told he had a kid from a one night stand he had when he was drunk. Like she told him after the child was born. At the time she told him ""Hey I don't expect any money or anything from you, I make good money, I just wanted to let you know."" She also has another kid from a similar situation with a different dude. My roommate doesn't make very much money and I charge him only about 60% of what would actually be his share of the rent (I've known him since high school so it was no big deal for me to help him out). He pays around $350 a month and the rent would normally be around $600 for a room. No big deal since any money he pays helps me out anyway. Since finding out about his kid he has an semi-active role in the kids raising.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to us moving out of the original apartment and into a nicer house late Feb 19. Days after moving in suddenly my roommate tells me ""Hey man I'm going to have to move out soon probably, It's getting hard to make rent and make payments for my kid."" This confused me because I remember the Mom saying that she wouldn't need money from him. When I asked him why he was making payments he said ""Yeah I still have to help out."" I understand wanting to help out, but I'm positive the mother makes more money than he and I combined. I don't know how much exactly he is paying but I am familiar with child support payments (my parents are divorced and I work at a place where i see others child support wage garnishments), and from my rough approximations he should probably only pay like $100 a month max. Him moving out really fucks me because I spent a bunch of my savings to get us moved over (repairing apartment, u haul, security deposit and other moving expenses). So I guess WIBTA if I tried to talk to my roommate and told him ""Hey dude I'm not sure how much you are paying, but you should probably be paying less."" I would say it more tactfully obviously and this would be a longer conversation than just that one sentence. I also am wondering if I should warn him that moving in with her is probably not the best idea, since he's only known her for a little while. We are both in our early 20's and his kids mom is in her early 30's. IMO the better way to solve this problem is for him to just hustle for more work and try to make better money so he can help out and still keep his own place.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Roommate found out he has a kid recently, I think he is paying too much in child support. WIBTA if I talked to him about it and recommended against moving in with the mother of his child (that he met fairly recently)?

0,"WIBTA If I decided to just completely block my MIL out of my life? | My partner and I (both 18) have been together for 3 years and unexpectedly fell pregnant with my daughter at 6 months along. Prior to this my mil wanted nothing to do with me at all and refused to talk to me whenever I was with his family. When I found out I was pregnant she all of a sudden started to get closer to me and I thought she was just genuinely taking interest in me for once and I did whatever I could to make her happy. I changed my daughters name twice, gave my daughter her fathers middle name as it’s carried along in the family, let her plan any events she wanted to and she did everything to the point that I was never actually allowed to go shopping for baby stuff because she had it covered. 

When the time came for me to be induced into labour I decided I would feel a lot better if I had just my mother and partner in the room as I have an incredibly close bond with them and my partner was all for it. My mil asked to just stop by and say hello and to help my partner be calm and prepared (as he has autism) which I thought was completely fair.. until she stayed for 9 hours and took pictures of all of my medical procedures down below while I told her to stop as did my gynaecologist because I was only 16.

My daughter was born with a birth defect that wasn’t easily detected but easily corrected with surgery so she stayed in hospital the first month of her life.. as did my mil. It got to the point where she would stay incredibly late and past visiting hours and I never had any alone time with my new family. She told my partner he wasn’t allowed to stay anymore and decided to come over alone and take my daughter and consent for medical procedures on my behalf. 

Since then she’s been stealing our daughters clinical follow up letters from the mail, overfeeding our daughter causing her surgical site to tear open slowly, I’m told that mothers are never allowed a break and my partner doesn’t have to do anything, She’s gone ahead to doctors without my partner or my daughter and tried to get fake medical diagnoses which we found out on a referral form my partner got stating he had over 5 medical issues he’s been assessed for by another doctor and doesn’t actually have. She’s told me that she should have my daughter because me struggling with depression and PTSD means that I’ll never actually enjoy her. 

She’s driving me and my partner up the wall absolutely crazy. I want my daughter to have a relationship with all of her family as I never got that but I don’t feel right with the fact that whenever she has my daughter she tries to teach her that my partner is a saint and that I’m a complete mess who just wants to sleep with any man I can get.",False,False

Vegan food is a lot cheaper than the groceries I currently am eating. I’m planning on cooking my own meals (which I mostly do now anyway). I’m 16 and still living with my parents and just because I’ve made a decision to better my health does not mean I should be paying for my own food.

My boyfriend is a very funny person imo and he likes to post humorous videos of him talking on Snapchat. Today, he posted one poking fun at how people are avoiding each other so much and at the end of it he made a comment about how that’s why he’s been so lonely because women must be avoiding him on purpose.

Now, I get that it was meant as a joke but he’s made a couple off hand remarks about this before and I’ve made it clear that they hurt my feelings because he has only ever made one small comment about even having a girlfriend on there since we’ve been together and multiple comments vaguely about attention from women. I replied back to his story asking if he really just talked about being lonely and lacking female attention on Snapchat and he told me it was a fucking joke and now isn’t replying.

1,"AITA for kicking a girl out of our campus “New Mexico Club” for not being from New Mexico? | So I realize the title may need a little explanation. I am from New Mexico and like a lot of people from my state, we consider being born/raised there as a unique experience. We have unique food (that is not necessarily Mexican and calling it Tex-Mex is a near hanging offense), a unique multi-ethnic culture, a stunning natural beauty and geography. The closest I’ve ever seen is how people feel coming from Hawaii. 

I go to school on the east coast. We have a club for people who were born or basically raised in New Mexico. We have huge dinners of New Mexican food, share contacts and a bunch of us will drive or fly across country together for breaks. 

Recently we had a girl join who’s story just didn’t make sense. We let her hang out but it really became clear she was just there to get Instagram pics with this guy who used to fight MMA out of the Jackson-Wink gym in Albuquerque. Of course he liked her because who doesn’t love getting blowies in the library study rooms but to most of it, it was such a stupid thing to lie about we didn’t want anything to do with her. I mean why not just approach him outside the group? He’s a nice guy.

Well we are now split, I kicked her out. About 40% of people think I’m way too harsh and the group should be open to people who just “have an interest” in New Mexico as opposed to being from there.  Half of those people think I’m an outright asshole. I counter thad rhe reason we have the club is for contacts when we move home...that goes against “just interest.”

1,"AITA for leaving my toddler with my 'childfree' sister for a few minutes, resulting in a trip to the emergency room? | I (18f) have a 2 year old daughter who lives with me and her father (18m), but spends two daytimes a week with my mom so that I can run errands (such as going to the doctors, doing the food shopping, cleaning the house, etc) and because my mom loves to spend time with my daughter. 

My 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. My sister and I have never really got on, when I got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks I force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). So, when I went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, I was shocked to find my sister there alone. I asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes. 

My sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why I think this happened. I huffed because I was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. My sister rolled her eyes. I asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch TV until mom came back. My sister said 'absolutely not, I hate children and I don't feel comfortable being alone with her'. 

Now, I completely understood this and I think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. I called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. My sister rolled her eyes and said 'Fine, I'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. I was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes. I didn't even think it would be a matter of 'coping' because it was such a short amount of time and the kid was tired.

So I left, and went for the bus. Literally five minutes later I get a call from my mom that they're taking my kid to the ER because she cracked her head open on the living room table. Apparently my sister had left the room for a couple minutes and my daughter wondered where she was going as she is never alone, so she tried to get off the sofa to follow her, and she slipped and whacked her head. 

I am absolutely raging at my sister. I don't get how she could be so fucking stupid to leave a kid alone. She argues that I 'emotionally manipulated' her into babysitting, which I feel I didn't. She says she thought it would be fine to leave the kid while she made a cup of coffee, but I feel like it's common fucking sense not to leave a kid on their own for more than like two seconds.

0,"AITA for not telling my nephew that I'm gay after he came out? | My nephew is 13 years old, I'm 31m. He apparently came out as gay on social media back during the pride month, but I learned about it a bit later while visiting my sister. The family was taken aback, but they accepted him; apart from our parents, that is his grandparents, who don't know yet.

The issue is I'm also gay, but I haven't exactly come out. Two friends of my know, and I don't really wish to tell anyone else at the moment.

As for why this is an issue, my nephew actually startled me a bit when I was last visiting home, because he straight up asked me if I've ever had a boyfriend when we were briefly alone. I denied it (well that's not really a lie), though I felt like he wanted more out of that conversation, but I decided to cut it short because I felt uncomfortable and strange.

AITA for not telling him that I'm also gay, though? Honestly it's not about my nephew at all, although I'm not even that close with my sister's family; it's just the fact that I don't like the idea of coming out to anyone in my home town.",False,False
1,"AITA for defending my choice of gifts? | WeI'm using a throwaway because this sounds bad even to my ears somewhat. The short story of it is, I have a ton of relatives but no actual family. My actual mother died when I was young. My adoptive parents and (some) biological relatives have admitted in therapy that they don't love me and only care for me and give me things out of guilt and obligation. I have higher care expectations placed on me as an ""oldest child"" that the actually loved family members don't have. All the obligation, no affection.

I'm not angry and I don't cry over it anymore, it's just a little sad to see that all of these people are capable of warm love, just not towards me. I don't do well in relationships and I wouldn't be shocked to die alone. I make terrible choices and I am overly kind and let people walk over me.

I'm not an addict or anything. I'm a standard mid-20s office worker living in the city. I graduated college. I've never been arrested. Never caused issues in school or at home. I'm just deeply unwanted, but I get that health insurance and phone bill covered (not for too long on both) as well as Christmas and birthday gifts.

Naturally, I want higher quality things. The gift train HAS a clear end, and I don't want junk. I need stuff that lasts. So I ask for things like real pearl earrings, good quality beauty products, down comforters, gift cards, and leather shoes (not all in one year obviously). I need good quality stuff, and quite frankly I deserve it as it's not like I get any other benefits of a family. I also don't have qualms about using my status to guilt people into giving me nicer hand me downs. I once made 5 people cry to win myself a solid gold intricate necklace. It's gorgeous.

I've gotten some flak over my asks and the fact that I not only don't avoid animal products but will ask for them. I don't think I should have to care. These things are higher quality. My relatives who are complaining will be getting care for life. I'll only get gifts for a few more years at most.

Edit: I also always give them and their children gifts, although standard ones. I'm not a monster.",False,False
1,"AITA for demanding that my girlfriend (long distance relationship) takes the time to write me a message after she'd a very busy day? | My girlfriend and I live in a long distance relationship, as in several countries apart. She's at med school and currently in the practical part of her education. She has to work six days a week from morning till evening, including night shifts. Additionally, she has to prepare for very important exams very soon. The time she doesn't spend working, she spends studying or sleeping to recover. It gives us very little time to communicate, and communication is very important to me. She doesn't like the current situation, but she wants to do well in her education.

I expect her to at least write me a message in the morning and the evening, just to hear something from her. It also eases my own mind, because if I don't hear anything I can stay at ease and have (for example) trouble sleeping. This is not because I am worried if I don't get messages, but because I get angry and I'm also a bit insecure. I think it should be possible for her to spend a minimum of one minute in the morning and the evening to write a few words. I normally, tend to write her regularly throughout her work days, just about thinks going on, but if she doesn't manage to write those one of those messages I just talked about, I'll stay silent until something comes from her. I also let her in an indirect/passive-aggressive way know that I am not happy with her lack of communication. Admittedly, part of my goal is to make her feel bad and to change her behaviour. I want to support her in any way possible through her difficult time, but I just can't help it if this minimum is not fulfilled. I know it pressures her and I feel bad, but I also feel the need to vent my frustration. She knows that it is important to me, but currently she has neither time or the energy to discuss it in length. I know she is trying, just as I am trying not to vent my frustration. Besides from that issue I have no problem with her being busy, I appreciate what she is doing and I let her know that.

Wife says that it is a “pay-it-forward” culture and they didn’t give me the carts so I could keep the money, each one gave me a cart so I could use it and then maybe pass it on to the next person who needed a cart.

In this class, group assignments exist more than individual assignments. It sucks balls because I hate doing group work since I was a small child. 

But, since this class is full of adults, things would be different! ...Right? 

Anyway, I was assigned to a group which I had to work with other two women. A & B. A is my age, 27, and B is much older than both of us, 36. 

The first group assignment was to interview social workers and their opinions on their job. Cool, easy peasy, except I had to do it in a language I am not a native of. This was 4 weeks ago. 

But I did it. I transcribed the interview. I did my part. Boom, done. So I emailed the other ladies my work and asked/told/reminded them to do their part as well. 

A agreed to it but B, oh, boy. 

B told me she didn't think it was important since she couldn't understand what we had to do. (A reminder: interviewing social workers about their work.) Thus, she saw no reason to do it. Alright. Cool. I told her she'd have to do it anyway. She didn't believe me. She complained about it even. 

A just agreed to do it without any issue. 

Then came yesterday, the instructor **finally** asked about the group assignment that **I** and only **I** did. 

__B just turned to look at me then tell the teacher **we** did it already.__ 

A forgot about it. B told me to read what I got. And the instructor just stood there dumbfounded. 

I said no. I told the instructor it's a group work and it's going to stay that way. I was not going to read whatever I had done on my own just to afloat us. 

A understood. B just glared at me. 

On the break, B confronted me about how selfish and inconsiderate I was towards the whole group. I reminded her that it's a group task, I did my part and I did my individual task already. (If I had to do this task on my own, I wouldn't want her to be graded with me.)

Back when we were dating, we took some slightly risqué Polaroids to hold onto. It was all in the name of fun but when our relationship ended I expected him to throw them out.

A few months ago I asked him if he did. He replies, “Of course.”

He runs a private spam page on instagram in which he posted this risqué picture of me tonight.

A friend alerted me and I immediately called my ex and told him to delete the picture now because I didn’t consent to it being on the internet and it was supposed to be kept as a private thing which happened in our relationship, which ENDED months ago. He also lied about throwing out the pictures?? 

To top it off the caption was about how he misses his exes or some bullshit. 

I am creeped to say the least and don’t know why he thought it was okay.


To end the phone call, he asks me if I would come to his gig this weekend because it’s all he cares about in this world. I sarcastically tell him I will not be there (because I have no respect for him now)

So my friend is an amazing cook and I love her food. I’ve been asking her to come over to teach me. 

Last week I asked her if she could come over and teach me how to make Pho. She agreed.
She mentioned to me she only knows how to make pho in a large batch because that’s how it’s typically made. So I told her that’s fine so then I’ll have food for the week.

She said she could get all the ingredients for me but asked if I could pitch in since it is expensive still up front. $50-$70 depending on what kind of pho I want beef pho or chicken, and she has to basically buy everything since I don’t have the ingredients and nor does she. 

So she says if she gets the ingredients, I can just pay her back. 

So I offered $10 because I honestly don’t have a lot of money myself. She also knows I’m not well off and struggling with some personal stuff right now. 

She then tells me then maybe we can revisit this when I can afford it, because she can’t afford to shell out $50-$70 on me and has her own family to feed.

I personally hated it when they were late, felt embarrassed by it and would be uneasy until they would arrive and sit down like the rest of the parents and relatives.
Unfortunately, my GF is chronically late, too. She doesn't mean to be late, but that still usually ends up being the case. She is also often unhappy with this circumstance, but can't seem to help it. As I suspected that my little sister would feel similarly uneasy, I desperately wanted to arrive on time to avoid this. Also, I didn't want to stress my GF or get into an argument before going there.
As a consequence, I told her the play started half an hour before it actually started. She was still stressed when getting ready and we got out of the house a bit too late for my made up time.

1,"Aita for telling my boss no when he tells me to do something? | So January this year i hurt my back really bad and was on sick leave for 8 months, when I came back my boss told me that my responsibilities in the department had gone too a new hire while I was away so he transferred me too another department (same building though) this made me really mad as I loved my job at my previous department and the work I did there was the main reason I said no when I got a job offer in October last year. Since I came back, my boss has told me too work in the department i was transferred from when the new hire is either sick or not at work for other reasons (the new hire is 50% employed I am 100%) because I am the only other person who knows how the work is supposed too be done and that it's my responsibility to help where I can, today I told him no, and that he should either up the new hire too 100% or find someone else he can train because I am not gonna work in that department as too me it's just adding insult too injury and even being there leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. And I also think it's downright disrespectful of him to make me work there when he even refuses too give me a reason he transferred me in the first place.

So I'm an introvert who loves gaming. I don't care what people say gaming is infact a hobby. I'm not socially awkward but just love indoor activities more. Because of my hobby i got to meet a girl who later will be a very good friend of mine. Me and noora play online together and even beyond to talking on phone and cam for hours whenever we get the chance. I've known her for almost 2 years now and yeah we've gotten pretty close. 

My GF of 6 months came over the past friday to surprise me. She's in college for her postgraduate program so she was busy alot and we couldn't meet for few weeks. Apparently her plan was to sneak up on me and put her hands in my eyes playfully and ask me out for dinner. She came into my room with me talking to noora on facetime while playing apex legends. She just stood there and said ""oh, i see how this is"" and left. Just like that. I tried going after her and trying talking to her but she didn't answer me.

1,"AITA For telling my wife she's a 7/10 | Alright, let me preface this:

My problem with the 0-10 rating system is that it's only good for judging physical appearance, but takes nothing else into account. This is a huge problem, people themselves aren't numbers.

Being that my scale only judges physical appearance, I tried to make it an objective, realistic scale that can apply to every human being all at once to eliminate as many inconsistencies as possible. In my mind, the vast majority of the people you meet are going to fall in the range of 5-7. Using this scale, I rate myself a 5.5.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is my personal (physical appearance only) 0-10 rating system. Use your imagination to fill nuances within the given ranges, as it's not strictly limited to integers:

&#x200B;

>**0-2:** I'm sorry. These are truly unfortunate people that are overtly deformed, or have gotten themselves into terrible accidents.  
>  
>  
>  
>**3-4:** Have hope, they just need to try harder. These people are what you would call ""plain"", or they have a few unattractive features that are hard to ignore.  
>  
>  
>  
>**5-7:** 90% of the population. Attractive enough to have more than a few romantic partners in life if they so please, but aren't attractive enough to skate by on their looks alone. This is the biologically dominant group. Attractive within reason, if you will.  
>  
>  
>  
>**8:** Well above average. This is where (what incels call) ""Chads"" and ""Stacies"" live. Could model for local stores as a side gig, or have a reasonably profitable snap chat premium.  
>  
>  
>  
>**9**: High end models that make a fortune from their looks.  
>  
>  
>  
>**10:** Reserved for legendarily attractive people. Only a few of these people have existed across time, so don't bother trying to get to this level.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were at dinner, and I was telling her about how the typical 1-10 scale can be fixed to be more accurate (as I mentioned before, 1-10 scales are dumb). Then she asked me what I would rate her.

Well I pride myself on not being a liar, so I told her she's a 7, the higher end of biological majority. She didn't seem to take this well, I think that she had trouble separating this scale from other people's scales (ones where ""10"" is thrown about without care).

&#x200B;

It's one of those damned if you do damned if you don't situations. I think number scales are dumb, so I just shouldn't mention them because obviously the people I love are going to ask where they fall and the number is going to sound bad, even though it isn't.

Neither of us had slept much the night before, so I was feeling tired myself. I climbed into the back seat and rested my head on his lap. It's mid winter and he's bundled up in blankets, and was comfortable. I was wearing my jacket and there's a lot of clutter in my car, so I wasn't really visible unless you looked in the car. He was.

1,"AITA for not showing interest in a family member's newborn baby? | For starters, I do not like children and babies. Nothing wrong with them, I just don't like them. Some are okay, when they are cute and quiet, but I generally dislike being around kids.


It was my aunt's birthday last week, they had a party, invited all of us (cousins and other aunts and uncles). 

My aunt (birthday girl) recently became a grandmother to a 1 month old baby (cousin's baby)

Saw my cousin with my aunt, said hi and happy birthday, saw him (cousin) holding his baby and I proceeded to just ignore the baby and move on to other members of the family to say hi.

Everyone who came before and after me was all googoo gaga over the baby, surrounding my cousin. I just proceeded to ignore the baby and talk about other things not relating to the baby.

I had a decent time, it was nice to be there. But a few days later, I was talking to my grandma and she told me that Aunt and cousin found it offensive that I didn't even say congratulations to my cousin or asked how the baby is or what his name is. 

To my defense, I really don't care about the baby, why do I need to fake interest in it? Does that make me an asshole?",False,False
1,"Aita for sitting a player on my baseball team because his mom called me? | I coach the sophomore/freshman baseball team at the high school that I work at. We have tryouts, so not everyone is garunteed a spot on the team, and nobody is assured any amount of playing time. I let all the boys know this at tryouts, I also tell them about my pet peeve. Which is the pet peeve of a lot of coaches: Do not have a parent call and complain about playing time. Simple as that. It is because high school leagues are not rec leagues, they are competitive and my job as a coach is to win, not make sure everyone gets fair playing time. 

The season started last week, we had two games. The team is 20 players, 13 of which are freshmen, which leaves only 7 sophomores. Last week one of my sophomores (I’ll call him A)started in right field, and I ended up pulling him in the 5th inning, the next game, I started someone else (a freshman) in right. There were many reasons I did this, the kid is not a terrific fielder, so I swap him for better defense late in games. The second game I only gave A a pinch hit appearance after he struck out twice in the first game. 

On Sunday night, I got a call from a woman I did not know. She introduced herself as A’s mom. She asked me why her son, who is a sophomore, was subbed out for a freshman, When the 6 other sophomores are playing. I informed her that the year in school does not necessarily mean more playing time. She told me that I was being extremely “unfair” to her son since he was the only sophomore sitting. And how he was probably embarrassed and I should feel like a jerk. She went on to say how hard he was working and how she felt he was better than the freshman. I told her my job is to win games and if she is unhappy with her sons playing time, to maybe consider outside lessons.  She hung up abruptly. 

Yesterday at practice, I gave a speech to the team about how I got a call from a parent regarding playing time. I didn’t say whose parent it was, but I encouraged them to explain the nature of the team to their parents if they didn’t understand. 

I’ve also decided I’m not going to give A much playing time this week, I would like to get a look at a few more freshmen in games. I also do not want his mom to think that her phone call worked, I want to show her the opposite that if anything that call is only going to get him less time on the field.

0,"AITA for eating the bride’s cupcake? | First time poster, new to reddit, hoping I did it right this time. Sorry in advance. I just found out about this situation a few days ago and it’s been torturing me. 

So my husband and I got married almost 2 years ago. My little sister got engaged this year and is planning her wedding for next year. This obviously brings up conversations between my husband and I about our wedding. This week I was updating him about wedding progress and he mentioned that he wished the people who didn’t come to our wedding (spouses of people who came and we planned on both of them attending)  would have let us know they weren’t coming so we could have invited other people. He mentioned his cousin’s husband, and a friend’s wife who didn’t come. I asked why his friend’s wife didn’t come to the wedding when his friend did come, and he said, ‘Because you ate her cupcake at her wedding’.

Cupcakegate happened 3 years prior to our wedding. The bride was from another country. She came to the US for a semester abroad, fell in love with his friend, went home, and then came back on the K1 visa to get married so she could stay in the US. Their wedding was at his family’s house and there were only 8-10 people there, including the bride and groom. They had the ceremony in the backyard and had an iPad up to skype her family in from her home country. After the ceremony, we ate dinner in the backyard and then there were cupcakes for dessert. If I remember right, they were on a 3 tier display. I made sure not to eat any cupcakes from the top tier; assuming they were for the bride and groom. All of the cupcakes looked exactly the same, they bride and groom didn’t cut a cake or so any kind of ceremonious thing to get their cupcakes first. I was just told by his family to grab a cupcake for dessert. I grabbed one on a lower tier. Apparently it was HER cupcake. 

Part of me thinks that’s an absolutely ridiculous thing to hold a 3 year (5 years at this point) grudge over, but at the same time just the fact that she has held it this long makes me wonder if I really f’ed up. I would have never taken her cupcake on purpose and I wish she would have said something to me so I would have known and could have apologized. Apparently I ruined her wedding and had no idea.

My husband and I both suffer with anxiety and depression but his stems more from how unhealthy his parents marriage was growing up and he never really got to see how a healthy relationship works. We’re trying our best to break that cycle bc my parents have been happily in love for 20 + years and may not be in the same kind of relationship as me, it is healthy for them. 

My husband and I have a godson thru my cousin who lives in Florida while we live in Tennessee. It’s about a 9 hour drive from here. We have been wanting to see them since he was born in August but my husband just hasn’t really had the PTO to do so. I finally have some time and now we have a car decent enough to go, my husband still doesn’t have enough time off tho. I’m about to start school and won’t be off again until March and wanted to get a quick trip in before school starts again.

My husband is having a really hard time with the idea of me leaving. He doesn’t want to be alone, he doesn’t want something to happen to me etc.. he’s just scared and I get it but, I’ve put his mental health before mine many times and put her hours away trips to my moms house because of this same reaction.

1,"AITA for telling a mother that it was fucking disgusting that she was letting her child chug parmesan out of a parmesan shaker at a restaurant? | I was in Chicago last week while my sister was in town visiting, and while we were having lunch at Navy Pier we were sitting next a late20s/early30s mother/caregiver and her young child, maybe 2 years old.

We were minding our business eating our overpriced deep dish pizza (delicious btw) but the three of us (my SO was also with us) couldn't help but notice the two of them because the woman didn't look up from her phone for most of the time they were there.

Props to the kid, very well behaved toddler, not fussy, no yelling. We all appreciated that. But then we were getting ready to leave. We had noticed that the toddler was holding what looked like a sippy cup and was throwing it back for several minutes, but when we started to get up my SO realized that it wasn't a sippy cup, it was the restaurant's parmesan shaker. 

We got up to go, put on our jackets, and as we left I got her attention and said, ""it's fucking disgusting that you're letting her put her mouth all over that."" I still feel bad for swearing but we are in the middle of a potential global pandemic, I couldn't not say something.

0,"AITA for threatening to stop supporting my wife financially? | I will start by saying I pay for about 70-80% of me and my wife’s cost of living expenses (necessities). She makes about 1/3 what I do so I like for her to be able to save and have extra money for things she wants, vice dump it all into cost of living.

My wife has a friend called Yasmin. Yasmin is part of some group (it has a spanish name so I don’t know what it is) that says they empower women. My wife told me about this group one day, apparently you submit $1000 (somewhere or to someone??) and become a level 1 group member, gaining levels by recruiting more members. Once you reach level 5 or so of the community, you have about 30 people under you, and you graduate from the community and receive $30,000. All the while the group is supposed to support each other and help you attain your goals by giving you that cash infusion at the end. The whole process is supposed to take 2 months.

As soon as she told me about this, the words MLM, scam, and other things came to mind. In my opinion, this is some type of MLM disguised in a veil of “empowerment of women.” Yasmin is 4 months in and still trying to recruit people because she has not seen her money yet. Somehow Yasmin has convinced my wife to join this cause. I tried explaining to her that some MLMs *do* actually work, but those stories are few and far between and only to the insider people who started the whole thing in the first place, never the grunts that join later. I told her that if she does this she will 1) never see her money again 2) become an embarrassment to herself as she begins to essentially ask all her friends and family for money to join the program so that she can get hers 3) waste a lot of time when this never works out. I think she has good intentions, at least as far as wanting to make more money and contribute, but she has somehow gotten tricked into thinking this get rich quick maneuver will work.

When she told me she wanted to join I fought her on it and told her that I will stop helping her pay for things on this main basis: I am currently doing so because I like to help her with her basic needs/necessities so she can spend her money on things she wants.  Because this $1000->$30,000 is not a 100% guarantee, she is essentially gambling her money that she will turn a profit. In this perspective, she has money beyond her basic wants and she even has enough to gamble with, therefore there is no reason for me to still be supporting her needs/necessities. 

I will admit that I feel like I am using money to strong arm her into making a decision for her. I would normally never do this to her but I just feel so strongly that she is about to get screwed over and I don’t want to see that happen to her, so I am almost threatening her to save her from herself. I did end the conversation with, I cannot make the decision for you, I can just tell you my thoughts on the matter and inform you of the actions I am going to take if you still decide to do through with this.",False,False

She immediately stopped smiling. I asked her what was wrong. She said under her breath “Cant believe Im marrying such an ass.” Then got up from the table and left. She’s now making dinner angrily.

She turned me down, in not the most kind way imaginable, so I've enforced a zero contact policy, against her wishes to remain friends.

Anyway, I'm a car mechanic, I'm 19 and I've gotten my Christmas break. I don't have as many days off work as I did high school, so I'm making the most of them. So, yeah, I'm 100% closed for business.

Anyway, randomly last night, Jen called me. Apparently she had gotten stuck in some snow. Her car don't handle winter at all, so she called me asking for help, since I've good enough truck + gear to help her out.

I flat out tell her I'm not gonna help her. She argues with me, and gets more and more upset. She starts getting aggressive and I just tell her she's ""probably got some fuckboy that can help you out"". I say I'm gonna hang up, she ***screams*** that I'm an asshole and that I'm ""leaving her to die, basically"", but I hang up.

0,"AITA for not paying for my abusive step-dad's medical bills? | My mom (67) and my step-dad (87) were married for 25 years after my dad divorced my mom. My mom got into drugs when she was 39, but just hid it from my dad. When my dad found out, he tried putting my mom into rehab, but she kept doing drugs no matter what my dad did. My dad divorced but did not get custody of me because of something with corruption and other things. This part is not very important.

My step-dad is a nightmare. He and my mom got married after 2 months of dating, with both of them doing hard drugs. They would both hit me. Sometimes with whips and sometimes with baseball bats. They would pawn everything I ever worked hard for just so they could get another shot of heroin. They would also inject me with some drug while I was sleeping because they didn't want me to wake up. I have multiple bruises and scars on my body because of them. So anyways, I was 6 when my mom and Satan got married. I would get hit and verbally abused for doing basically nothing. Got a A in school? Hit because I was, ""trying to show off."" Got a B? Hit because I was stupid. Took a few more seconds to walk home from school? Hit because I was late. Every person who I told about my abuse never believed me even after I showed them some bruises. My devil parents would threaten to kill me if I ever told the police. I worked odd jobs for less than minimum wage for most of my childhood just to feed myself.

Now i'm 31. I earn close to $40 an hour from my job, which I am lucky to have. 2 years ago when my step-dad was 85, he fell ill due to cancer.  I at first payed some of his medical bills. I honestly wish I never did in the first place. Just last year, I decided to stop because I realized how bad of people they were and how much I wanted them to die. I got harassed on Facebook nonstop from the both of them because of how terrible I apparently am. One of my aunts now believes that I am also a terrible person because she has lived in another continent and I never even knew she existed, so my mom fed her some lies.

0,"AITA for refusing to let my sister use my charger and taking away her Netflix and Hulu | In my family, we share a lot of things and I’ve had no problem with it in the past as long as people ask. My sister, M, on top of being a total jerk and textbook definition of troubled teen, won’t usually ask. She’s had a history with coming into my room and taking my phone charger when she wants and not even having the decency to give it back or tell me she took it so I’ll search the whole house looking for it. Last time I let her borrow my charger, she broke it and refused to apologize. Because of this, I’m already reluctant to let her use it. Especially after yesterday. 

When she handed me back my charger yesterday, it had bite marks and the inner layer was exposed. It still works, but probably not for much longer. She asked to borrow it and returned it when I asked, but I’m angry that now I’ll have to buy a new one and my family and I are already low on money as is. 

This, plus the fact that she was up all night blasting music and talking really loud (her room is next to mine. She doesn’t have a door and I leave mine open so the dogs can get in and out), has me already annoyed. I didn’t say anything till this morning since she was having a serious convo with my mom all night, but I did ask her to turn the music down around the 4th time I was awaken (and she laughed and said no). Because of this, I’m already annoyed. When she asks to use it shortly after, I said no. Her response? She grabs the charger and tries to take it anyway. I grab onto it and tell her no cause she damaged it and to stop pulling on it. 

M calls me rude and says the damage was from our niece (who just turned 3) biting on it when she was babysitting her. I tell her she still can’t have it and my mom yells at me from the other room to give it and I still refuse. M calls me a Bitch and my mom says she can see why M doesn’t want a relationship with me and that’s good. 

That last bit stung because M recently told me she didn’t want a relationship with me, so I took away her Netflix and Hulu account since I pay for it and the tv. I gave it back to her (altho her Netflix was deleted and I gave her a new profile) but now I’m thinking about taking it away again if not now, then when I leave for college in a month. 

Our mom never follows through with a punishment. M isn’t supposed to have her phone for the summer after running away. It’s why M always feels entitled to everything. She’ll do something bad and look me in the eyes and say it doesn’t matter cause she won’t get in trouble anyway. I’m not her mom, but I’ve done my best to support her and this household for years.

About half a year ago there was a huge fallout between my sister, dad, dad’s gf, and myself. My dad’s gf ended up saying she wasn’t allowed back over to their house until she apologized. 

Since then my dad and his gf got into many arguments about letting her over, which eventually led to her kicking my dad and I out of the house making us rent an apartment for a few months until she deems is ready to move back in. I just graduated college so I didn’t have a stash of money laying around to just get a place by myself otherwise I would’ve. 

The issue starts when the other day I start taking to my sister again after many months and decide I wanted to have a relationship with her again and I missed her.  I’m planning on meeting her this Friday for dinner. My dad was glad that I was going to dinner with her, but his gf was very upset by this and kept advising me to cut contact with her. I was pretty upset and told her that I miss her and I’m going to meet her for dinner, and I asked her very nicely to please stop trying to get me to cancel.

About 5 years ago for her birthday, I planned a trip to Savannah GA for her (she's a big history buff and loved all the surrounding areas). Instead of having her parents watch our then 3 year old, I decided to take him along with us. After the trip she said she would much rather have had her parents watch him.

1,"AITA Critisizing ceremony | Obligatory mobile warning

Backstory:

So, today my school visited Arlington national cemetery (USA) and  we volunteered to lay wreaths at the tomb of the unknown soldier, witch is a very prestigious ceremony. There are supposed to be 4 wreath bearers, but five of us volunteered. I decided to be the bigger man and let the others participate, as they all had family members either buried there and/or serving at the time, and I just wanted to honor fallen soldiers. Also, I have been in Boy Scouts for 5 years and am a full-time honor guard with professional training. 


The story: 

During the ceremony, I was annoyed that they had completely disregarded all of my tips on upright standing, when to salute, and how to walk at “attention” stature. 
I decided that I should talk to them about it after wards, and to try to soften the mood, I divided to start with a joke, so I plainly called it “sloppy,” and preceded to critique a large section of the ceremony using my knowledge of flag ceremonies and honor guard. 
Afterwards, these friends were pissed and would avoid me, and then told me that I should not critique there performance, and that just doing it alone was enough for them, and now I kinda feel like a really big asshole. 

Am I the asshole? Please also tell me why.  ",False,False
0,"AITA for wanting my brother to buy me a new laptop? | Hey guys, so this actually happened a few months ago. My mom was babysitting my brother's twins. I love those little boogers but don't like them in my room! One day I let them come in so we could watch TV together. I fucked up and placed my laptop on the floor right next to my bed next to the wall so that they wouldn't accidentally sit on it or drop it jajajajaja! Big mistake, THE GIRL LEGIT JUMPED ON IT like it was some sort of musical mat!!! I was so mad because they are 5 old enough to know what it is right?
 I only mentioned it once to my brother like, ""hey 'the girl' stepped on my laptop after I told them no running around in the room, you mind giving me half so I can get a new laptop"" and him and his wife immediately thought I was the biggest douche for asking!!

1,"AITA for cutting my parents out my life after I found out they weren’t going to leave my their house in their will? | I know the titles makes me sound entitled or spoiled but I’m not. Hear me out.

I am an only child and my parents both worked full time jobs for most of my life. I had to pretty much raise myself. I had to get myself ready for school, make my own lunches and often my own dinners as both my parents worked a lot of overtime. Regardless of my struggles I was able to overcome it and become a quality member of society. I dropped out of college to pursue a career in acting. Which I am still working on to this day. I work full time as an electrician and since I live in LA I barely make it. All I can afford is a crappy studio apartment but that’s ok I’m happy with my life because I am going to be a successful actor one day and money won’t mean anything to me.

Anyways I left home a while ago and don’t see my parents too often, we talk occasionally on the phone but other than that we don’t really communicate. The other day I was visiting them and my mother informed me that both she and my father were going to be retiring within the next year and then they would be renting the house out while they traveled around the world. That got us to talking about the house more and my mother said that after they traveled for a while they were gonna likely sell the house and buy property somewhere in Italy or Spain and retire comfortably by some beach. 

I then said “what about me” and my mother says “what about you?” Aren’t I going to get anything from you guys? The house was supposed to go to me when you guys died.” My mother chucked and said “why would we give you the house? You never put any work or money into it. Your father asked for your help on the garage and you said no. So why would we leave the house to you?” I was shocked she was saying this to me. And I go “well because that’s your obligation. It’s what parents do. You guys own that house. Are you at least going to give me any money when you sell it?” Again my mother laughed and said “of course not, you’re gonna be an actor right? You’re gonna have your own money why do you need ours. Besides we will need it to buy property abroad.” 

I stood there shocked and said “what am I gonna with property abroad when you guys die?” My mother then says we won’t be leaving it to you, in our wills that property will go to some charities”.

At that point I turned around and just walked away. I could believe what she said. As I was about to walk out the door I looked back at my mother and told her from this moment on she and my father were dead to me and then I left. I kind of feel bad now. Was I the one in the wrong here?",False,False
1,"AITA the asshole for refusing to do a list a chores my gf left for me? | Gf and I have lived together since October.  We share in the housework on weekends.   We usually spend Sunday doing a deep cleaning and doing any other errands that need to be done.   It’s worked out well for us.  

This week I’m on vacation from work.  When I woke up this morning I found a list of things my gf wanted me to do today.  I’m really bothered by it.  I’m not her child.  It’s so insulting.  Honestly had she asked me nicely the night before if I minded doing some of these things I wouldn’t have had a problem, but to leave me a list of chores is just rubbing me the wrong way.  

I crumpled the list up and did my own thing today.  When gf came home she was annoyed that nothing got done.  She doesn’t see the difference between asking me with a shred of respect to do some things and leaving me a list like she’s my mother.   She’s been grumbling and moody all night, but I’m not going to apologize.  I think my feelings are justified. ",False,False
0,"AITA for buying a $1300 spinning wheel without consulting my husband? | It sounds worse than it is. I promise. 

Background: So my husband (m36) and I (f31) have been married for 5 years, together for 10. We are not wealthy but we are very comfortable. We both make ~75k/year, we live in a small 3 bedroom house with a very low mortgage (less than $700 a month!). I have paid off my student loan debt and have no other debt besides the house. He has a car he bought last year,but it's still a very affordable car. We have no kids. No plans to have kids. Our expenses are very low, we live in a LCL area. 

Our finances are set up in a ""yours, mine, ours"" kind of way. Both of our paychecks go into one joint bank account. This is our main account that we use to make household purchases (groceries, small furniture, etc) and pay our bills and stuff. We have another ""rainy day"" account where we keep $6k for us to use when we need to make short-notice large purchases or emergency purchases, like if we decide to get a new couch or TV or random medical trips. We also have a main savings account and investment accounts and any money pulled from the rainy day account gets ""refilled"" by adjusting our input into savings account until we're back at 6K. We also have our own personal accounts. We budget $600/month each for our own money, like an allowance. 

For the last 6 months I've been saving a portion of my money in order to buy a handcrafted custom yarn spinning wheel, it's part of my hobby and something I've been wanting for years and it was around $1300. Last month, something on my husband car broke and it was about $900 to fix it. We used money from our rainy day account to fix it. When my wheel came in yesterday my husband threw a whole fit about it I was being selfish by ""hiding"" $1000 from him when it could have been used to fix the car instead of dipping into our emergency fund and that I should have asked before making such a huge purchase. I told him that  it's not fair to expect me to give up money that I saved up to fix his car and that I shouldn't have to get his permission to make this purchase for myself with my own money. 
This is also the first time I've ever made such a large purchase for myself. AITA?",False,False

0,"AITA for thinking my Wife's picky eating is selfish? | So let me preface that my wife does NOT have sensory issues with eating, she does not have ARFID because I realize that is a REAL issue. 

Let me preface this that we've been married for 8 years, have 1 kid (4 years old) and this has pretty much been a battle for the entire marriage. 

Basically the issue is two-fold, my wife does not want to try any foods besides what she likes (Which is mostly unhealthy foods) where-as I like to try different things and prefer to eat healthier meals. For anyone that has a picky spouse....this doesn't really work very well to just ""hold your ground"", especially with a kid because you cannot make two separate meals each time you cook. Also it doesn't really actually benefit me to do so since I usually am the one cooking (I get home earlier so it makes sense, although sometimes I do get salty about it).

The problem is basically that she refuses to try new things, any indication of trying something healthy and it's ""I don't want to eat that"". Most people would say ""Well let her make her own things""....that doesn't work out well when you have a kid to see. Also I receive the guilt trip ""Well what am I supposed to eat then?"" etc..., it doesn't help that she's pregnant currently (3 months, but this is NOT a pregnancy thing for what it's worth) so im stuck sort of doing everything anyways. The second part to that is it's making our kid a poor eater and picky (Which was my greatest fear). 

So now the kid really only likes a few things (Sound familiar?) and that makes it an even bigger pain in the ass. She also complains about her weight (before the pregnancy) but the problem is she eats fast food EVERY single day for lunch. I feel like it's impossible for me to eat healthy now (Outside of Lunch and breakfast). The fast food thing leads into my next problem which is $$$$$$.

So the secondary problem is her eating fast food for lunch everyday is EXTREMELY expensive, she also wants to go out to a lot of restaurants as well. We aren't poor by any means but I try to keep a strict budget that she is constantly breaking (and not by a few bucks, were talking 3-4 hundred a month OVER). I've basically been forced to eat the cheapest shit imaginable every day for lunch to at least reduce the blowback. 7-8 bucks a day doesn't seem like a lot, but I constantly remind her that this is adding up to be multiple hundreds of dollars a month in just lunch. For anyone that wants to jump in and say im trying to control her im not, I think eating out is fine...but when it ends up impacting our budget (Our food budget is skyrocketed simply from this which just is not sustainable) then it becomes a matter of just budgeting. I haven't eaten out for lunch in I don't know how long, not to mention I have to put in the extra work to meal prep just so we don't spend any money.

Am I the asshole? If I sound salty it's because I am...but I really don't know what to do. I know ""it's just food"" but the money portion of it is more important to me than just missing out on trying meals, but honestly it really is a bummer to eat the same thing over and over when I want to try healthier eating. God forbid if I wanted to be a vegetarian or something.",False,False
1,"AITA for refusing to help my sister with her vet bills because her dog ate my food? | I (20F) am currently living with my sister (28F) and her husband. My parents moved out of the state and I couldn’t go with them, so I’m staying with her until I can get a place. 

My sister has a five year old dog. I frequently help with the dog. I sometimes take over walking and feeding her when my sister or her husband are running late at work, even though I don’t think it’s my responsibility. 

I tend to keep snacks and candies in my room, so my sister asks that I make sure to shut the door so that the dog won’t get in there. The dog can, however, open the door if she is persistent enough. She’s pretty smart. 

On this particular day, I don’t know if I left the door cracked a bit, or if she got into the room on her own, but I came home to find her very lethargic. I went to my room and saw that she had gotten in and eaten and entire bag of fun sized chocolates, candy, Oreos, chips. Pretty much all of the snacks that I had. 

I alerted my sister and took the dog to the emergency vet. I had only been gone from the house for two hours for class. The dog ended up being ok, but the vet bill is nearly $1,000.

My sister is saying that I should pay most of the vet bill, and I told her no because it is her dog. She thinks that her dog getting hurt is my fault, so I should pay. But I think that if the dog can get into stuff, maybe she should be confined to one area of the house. 

To me, it is her fault the dog got into my stuff. I don’t think I’m responsible for the bill at all. I am also trying to save money to get my own place. Having to pay $1000, will put a serious dent in my plan. I am unable to work many hours because I am in school. 

She is threatening to kick me out if I don’t help her or get our parents to help her. This really sucks because I have no where else to go at the moment. I think she’s an asshole for threatening to kick me out over something that wasn’t my fault, she thinks I’m an asshole for refusing to help with the bill. Who is the asshole?",False,False
0,"AITA for telling an intern to throw her banana peel in the trash? | A few details to set the stage: To get into my place of work, one needs to walk  from the parking lot down a sidewalk that is along the side of the building. The other side of the sidewalk is semi-wooded with low growing evergreen shrubs. This sidewalk is about 100ft long, and has a trash can at either end.  Also, in the last month, there have been a ton of flies buzzing around this area, so much so that the building manager called an exterminator.

This morning, I (\~30s F) witnessed an intern (20s F) for one of the companies in our building walking into work eating a banana.  About 3/4 of the way down the sidewalk, with a trashcan not even 25 feet away, she tossed the banana peel into the bushes.   It landed on top of the bush and she just kept walking.  I wasn't sufficiently caffeinated to be polite, so I blurted out ""What the hell? There's a trash can right in front of you!"" complete with the WTF hand gesture; pointing to the trash can.

She ripped into me, claiming it's organic and feeds the animals.  She was half yelling / half crying.  

I pointed at the peel sitting on top of the bush and told her to ""pick up your (her) damn banana peel.""

Instead she cried loudly saying something unintelligible, got her peel, and put it in the trash. 

I'm thinking, great, this is over.   Maybe she won't toss her banana debris into the bushes and we will have less flies.   I'm sure I could have been more nice about it / sworn less, but I was just so shocked to see someone litter like that.  I badged in to the building and she walked in behind me. At some point, she must have cried to her boss about it, because her boss found me today and asked if I confronted her intern.  I said I had, then explained, as I have done here, about the banana peel. I guess she spent all morning crying about how ""mean"" I was and couldn't do any work.  My brain was screaming ""drama queen"" but I apologized instead for upsetting the intern.  We laughed  together about absurdity of it all, especially over a banana peel!

1,"AITA for not wanting to pay a dude what I owe him | So, I recently moved into a new apartment building and it’s a relatively active community with groups of friends throughout the building.

I’m fine with it and all, it was a good time and full disclosure they did offer to pay but I turned them down since I thought it’d be a one time thing. 
           
The next day comes around and they were telling me over lunch that they’d want to do it again and I told them how to buy one for themselves and they simply said “nah we can just use yours” I shrug it off and go on with my day, and like clockwork at night they wanna get high again, which is fine because tbh so do I. So we’re stoned around 3 A.M and this one dude, we’ll call him asparagus for animosity, starts to talk about ordering a pizza. I give him my order(a medium pizza).

Two days after that he comes to my door while I have guests and rudely(probably as a joke) asks me about the 6 bucks, I said “dude I let you get high twice for free do I really have to” which admittedly wasn’t the best response.

0,"WIBTA for hiding my laptop and PS4 when my family visits for holidays? | So for general context I am 22, and the cousins are 7, 9, and 11.  I live at home with my parents, and I pay rent.  My room upstairs is mine to do with as I please per agreement with my parents and it has a lock on it that only I have the key to.

So for the last several years my family hosts Thanksgiving and Christmas because we are pretty close to the halfway point for a lot of our relatives that live in different states so it makes sense for everyone to go here.  We have plenty of space and my mom loves hosting so it works out great.  The only issue I have is with 3 of my younger cousins who all see me as the ""cool"" older cousin.

Now don't get me wrong.  I love these kids.  I love hanging out with them and playing games.  I even put my Switch in the shared living room so they could play Mario Kart and stuff with or without me.  The issue is that they also want to play with all the electronics in my room.  This includes my laptop which is used almost exclusively for work, and my PS4 which is not something I let other people play with.  

With past consoles I've kept in my room I used to just let them play to shut them up, but after a few hours I'd come back to saves erased, sticky controllers (Most from the younger 2.  Oldest is actually relatively well behaved.) and one time a broken TV because one of the kids tried to pull the console out of the TV stand and ended up bringing down the whole stand and TV with it.  Their parents paid for the TV to be replaced and nothing else was damaged so I am not mad about it, but I decided from then on I didn't want them in my room playing with my stuff.

I brought this up with my parents, and they agree I have every right to lock up my room and keep the kids out, but they think it will cause drama with the kids and the parents making the kids feel unwanted and hurt their feelings.  I can see that point of view, and I definitely don't want to hurt their feelings.  The issue is after bringing up their destructive behavior my parents think its just ""kids being kids"" and that I need to accept that things are going to break.  They cite examples of things around the house that I broke when I was younger that they just accepted as well as things my cousins have damaged that they aren't mad about.  And even argue that my aunt and uncle are happy to pay for replacements if anything gets broken so why be mad about it?  This makes me feel a bit guilty honestly.

Now my plan for avoiding the conflict is to wait until the day before they get here and take my PS4, Laptop, and anything else they would want to play with and hiding them in my trunk until they leave.  I could say that my laptop is in the shop for repairs, and my friend is borrowing my PS4.  That way I can leave my room open so we can hang out up there, but there isn't anything for them to play with so they will go back downstairs and maybe play the Switch.

So I guess what I am trying to figure out is is it shitty of me to hide things from these kids that they enjoy just so I can avoid potentially getting them dirty or damaged?  Should I hope that they are better behaved this time, or should I maybe instead just have a talk with their parents and set ground rules instead of this trick I'd be playing on all of them?  Is that the less assholish way to approach all this?",False,False

They have been US citizens for over 50 years now and safe to say we are proud to be Americans, and love our country. 

My ex is American with Dutch ancestry & he only speaks English. I was with him for 1.5 years, before I unexpectedly fell pregnant (my BC failed) and my parents found out pretty much straight away because nosy Indian parents will find a way to know everything. 

The outpouring of love and support from my 2 old folks was tremendous and they were staunchly on my side and babies side especially because when I told my ex I was pregnant he bailed and went MIA for 3 entire years (he still paid CS) the rest of the Indian community basically shunned me and called me a whore but my parents stuck by me. 

I moved back with my parents and they added an entire wing to their home just for me and my baby. They speak only Gujarati at home, as my parents have multiple businesses in India, and they prefer it. My mom and dad only speak to my kid in Gujarati and asked that I make sure she knows her heritage and her home. 

I spoke with a child psychologist who told me it is absolutely healthy and okay for her development if I speak minimal English with her at home, because she’s exposed to so much American culture via external sources / tv and I speak English when I’m around others including with her when we are out and about. 

My ex came back into my life when my daughter was 3 because he had a change of heart and wanted to meet his daughter. He has fallen head over heels in love with her and begrudgingly I have to say he is a fantastic father and my daughter absolutely loves him. She’s 6 now and the two both look exactly the same as well as act exactly the same- he is very charismatic and silly and he has taught her those qualities because I’m pretty boring and serious and she has really opened up in a way I’m proud to see. 

His only ‘complaint’ is that she babbles to herself in Gujarati ALL the time and my ex hates it. He also feels that I’m delaying her development by strictly speaking in Gujarati when I’m at home and that it’s un-American of me. He has also expressed dissatisfaction that he can’t understand her and that he’s missing out on sweet moments because sometimes she can’t translate into English. She can speak English perfectly but she seems more confident in Gujarati, which I myself have noticed. 

I told him that he can either learn Gujarati or put up with our daughter being more comfortable in Gujarati. He thinks I’m being difficult on purpose but I really don’t feel like I’m doing anything wrong.",False,False
1,"AITA for scheduling my breast augmentation surgery on the day before my cousin’s wedding? | I (20F) scheduled my surgery on 12/12. There were only two slots left before my preferred surgeon shut down his clinic for a three week hiatus. The earlier date couldn’t work with my schedule and I was free 12/12. I wanted to get my surgery done at a time where I had three weeks off from school to recover. 


My cousin (25F) has her wedding on the evening of 12/13 and I am one of the eight bridesmaids. We were hanging out yesterday and I told her about my appointment. She was upset at me for scheduling it the day before her wedding. I apologized but let her know that that was the only spot available that worked with my schedule. 


She said she had a couple of friends who have gotten boob jobs and their breasts had to be wrapped in gauze bandages for a few days so I wouldn’t be able to wear my bridesmaid dress. She also said that I would be on heavy medication and wouldn’t be able to function normally. I told her that I didn’t know it was that bad. 


She seemed angry and just told me to rest at home since her wedding obviously doesn’t mean that much to me. I apologized again and said I’ll definitely be there and function as best as I can no matter how much pain I’ll be in after the surgery. 


She didn’t seem too pleased with me the rest of the night. I know how much this wedding means to her since she keeps talking about it, and it means a lot to me too since I love my cousin, but getting this surgery at that time means just as much to me.",False,False
0,"AITA for walking out on a rude interviewer? | I am a 22 year old college student. Working on a bachelor's in Computer Science (currently have an associate's degree in this field).

I visited a job agency that set me up for an interview to work as a dishwasher at a Denny's. Glamorous job right? I'm not picky. I just need some extra money to help my mom out. I currently don't have any job experience, embarrassing, I know. So I thought I could start off simple with a low entry level job. 


When getting to this interview I had been coached by the agency and had decent attire. Upon meeting the manager, I gave him a short resume of what I have done (work related experiences and my academic achievements which are usually impressive to schools but not employers)


He says ""These are all white lies. This is not real experience"" 


Me: ""It might not be relevant for dishwashing but I am competent enough to clean a dish""

Him: ""I have applicants with THIS much experience"" and he gestures with his hand a thick shape to suggest a large resume. 


Me:"" I guess we are done here then"" 

And I just get up and leave. it didn't seem like he was really going to consider me and I felt insulted. He called the agency and complained that I got up and abandoned the interview in the middle of it and wasted his time. The agency said to me that you ""NEVER leave an interview "" .

1,"AITA for ""outsourcing"" my job to my friend? | Throwaway because identifying info on main account.

I'm in my early 20's, and work as a Software Engineer. To be honest it's a dream job, I'm making more than most people my age, can work from home whenever I like, get great benefits, and it's a pretty big company so will look great on my resume. 

However, the job is also pretty demanding, we frequently have crunch periods where everyone on the team is putting in 60+ hours, often from home. This puts a huge strain on my schedule, as often times I'd have to cancel plans with friends or skip the Gym in order to hit deadlines.

Recently I got stuck on a bit of a code loop that just wasn't playing nice, and decided to quickly ask one of my friends who graduated with me. After a bit of back and forth he was able to sort it out, and that's when I had an idea. My friend hasn't been able to find steady employment since graduating, and I know money's been getting tight for him. So I asked if he'd be willing to assist me with some coding tasks, and in return I could pay him by the hour.

He was eager to accept, and to be honest it's been amazing for me. Since I started handing work off to him, I've gone from needing to work 50-60+ hours/week to now being able to get everything done in less than half that time. In fact when I'm not in the office, I almost never have to actually do any additional work, and have been able to hang out, hit the Gym more, and relax. And best part is that even with paying my friend by the hour, I'm still making a more than comfortable salary, but now I can actually find time to spend it and enjoy it.

However, I was talking about this with another friend, and he said that I'm an asshole because I wasn't giving my friend a 50% cut, despite him doing more than 50% of the work. To me I'm being more than fair, as I offered him a rate that he's happy with, he's making more than he did at his part time job, and ultimately I'm the one who got the job.

So Reddit what do you think?

0,"AITA for reducing my tip to compensate for a drink I didn’t order?

My girlfriend got the same entree and a tea. When the cheque came we had been charged the same amount, $10 for the entree and $2 for a “beverage”. When I pointed this out to the waitress she said water was a beverage and I needed to pay for it. 

When it came time to tip time I did the math for what I would usually tip, $2.50 tip for my $10 entree and then subtracted the price of the $2 tap water. Basically I left a .50 cent tip. My girlfriend thinks it was an asshole move and I think I’m not paying $2 for lukewarm tap water. basically I brought my cheque total to the $12.50 it would have originally been without the water added.",False,False
1,"AITA for hiding a spider from my boyfriend as light hearted revenge for him being messy? | Yesterday morning, my boyfriend and I were waking up when I saw a scary black spider scurrying across the floor. I'm pretty scared of spiders, and I think he's about the same level of terrified of them.

Also somewhat relevant, he is between housing situations and staying with me in my studio for a month until he moves into his new place. He is messier than me, and has probably created many homes for spiders with the piles of things he has left around. He has improved though and he's awesome and responsive to criticism. Just a lot of two steps forward one step back progress.

I said something like, ""Holy shit, look at that spider!"" He leapt back in alarm and then looked at it carefully from a safe distance. He asked me to quickly grab a cup before it got away, so I ran to the kitchen.

I use glass jam jars as cups, and that was the first thing I saw so I grabbed one and brought it to him. Once the spider was under the jar he asked for a lid. I had saved all the lids, so I tried a lid on another old jam jar before I brought it back. When I had the second jam jar in my hand is when I started plotting.

He captured and jarred the spider, sealing the lid tightly. He set the spider jar on the bookshelf and started to get his shoes on. While he was doing that I grabbed the other matching jar, lidded it, and while he was bent over putting his shoes on in front of the shelf I reached over him and swapped the two jars. I put a blanket over myself to go outside (it was cold too) so that he wouldn't see the spider jar in my pocket.

I started inspecting the empty jar carefully. I told him to have a look, and that it looked like the spider was gone. We both carefully looked at the jar for a bit, trying to spot the spider. He became more and more freaked out, shaking the jar, looking around the bookshelf. I say something like ""we'll never find it with all these clothes and snacks around the apartment"". Finally he ran out of my apartment, saying he was going to open it outside to check that it was really gone. 

I went with him, spider jar in my pocket. He opened the empty jar carefully, then moved back from it to inspect from a distance. When it was clear there was no spider he started freaking out, saying there's no way it could have gotten out but it did so it must be in the apartment and it must be angry and out for spider revenge. He started crying, and saying he was going to go to his friends house for the night and maybe move his stuff there later, and that he can't go back in my apartment.

I didn't expect things to go so far. I pull out the spider jar and show him that the spider is still in captivity, it was just a dumb prank, and apologize. He freezes, then quietly takes the jar from me and goes and lets the spider out in the grass.

He hasn't talked to me since. I really thought it was a harmless prank. I do feel bad and apologized to him.

0,"AITA for posting messages exposing my friend as a liar over something that happened at her wedding? | I’m using a throwaway account because I use my main solely in another sub.

I was invited to an old school friend’s wedding that happened a few days ago. We’re not ride or die, but whenever we’re both in the same region we always meet up.

I ordered a nice yellow jumpsuit for the wedding from a trusted retailer. When it came, it was much paler than the picture, basically a straw yellow. I started to worry as I’d read those stories about guests wanting to steal the thunder by wearing white/traditional wedding dress colours at weddings, and I messaged my friend to ask if she was wearing white. She said she was, and asked why. I sent a picture of the jumpsuit and said that this was what I’d been sent in place of a much brighter colour. She said that it looked fine, and she’d shut anyone up if they tried to make a deal about it on the day.

On the day itself, I didn’t actually get any comments about it directly, which was a relief. However, when I went to the bathroom, I encountered two of the bridesmaids gossiping about how that girl in the jumpsuit (so, me) had the nerve to wear it, especially after the bride had told her directly it wasn’t suitable. To frame this as it happened, I was in a cubicle when they came in and started chatting. I came out of the cubicle, and said that no such conversation had happened, and if the bride really had an issue she should have told me months ago when we talked about it. They basically scoffed and said they’d believe me when they saw the ‘receipts’. I saw them later on in the evening with the bride, and all three of them were giving me the stink eye.

Yesterday, the bride posted a thank you message on Facebook, with the comment that ‘even scene-stealing wannabes’ couldn’t spoil the day. I was going to leave it, but one of the bridesmaids commented with a poorly-taken picture of me from behind with drawn-on devil horns and tail. I reacted on impulse, and posted screenshots of the conversation where the bride had told me that my outfit was fine, with a comment saying that it was a shame that the bride couldn’t tell me to my face there was an issue, and that since I’d been asked for ‘receipts’, here they were. The comment got a few further comments saying that the tea had been spilled and that this is what happens when people don’t know all the facts, as well as the inevitable ones saying that I was being childish and creating a drama.

I do view this as stooping down to the level of those who couldn’t even tell me straight there was an issue (I mean I had another dress in my car just in case I got comments) in how I reacted, but I also think I was defending my reputation and honour among people I’ve known for over two decades. The peace-keeping side of me wants to apologise to the bride, but my heart knows she won’t offer the same olive branch, especially now people know she was two-faced in this situation.",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I asked my girlfriend to not bring her emotional support cat to our apartment? | My girlfriend and I are going to be moving in an apartment together with four of our friends while we are all going to college. She has a cat that is used as an emotional support animal and asked for all of our friends permission to move the cat into the apartment with us. She insisted that her cat was very well behaved and would not cause trouble. All of us agreed so long as she is solely responsible for the cat.

Despite her cat being an emotional support animal, she lived without her cat for a while because she didn't want her cat to only be confined to her dorm room, but now that we are all moving into a large apartment, she believes that her cat would have enough space in it.

After spring break when our college closed, I spent a few nights at her place because her hometown was closer to our college than mine. While I was there, I met her cat, and I don't know about living with it anymore. Her cat kept pulling at my clothes and scratched my hand unprovoked. It also kept pulling my girlfriend's headphones and biting them. The cat also knocked a bunch of stuff off of my girlfriend's counter. 

I just get really anxious around her cat now too. Her cat will come up to you and not leave you alone until you pet it, and will then scratch you when you stop petting it. I had a cat before and my cat was always really calm, but her cat is constantly hitting at things. My girlfriend also let's her cat jump onto the counters and does not care, but I don't want to have the cat be on our counters at the apartment we are getting.

I have been on these hours for over 6 years since our son was born. He started kindergarten this year so after I get off work, I come home and get him ready for school, take him to school, and drop him off. We also have a 3 year old at home too, who I drop off at my in-laws while my wife works. If I’m lucky I’m home and asleep by 10am while being up at 2:30 in order to pick up my daughter from my in-laws and my son from school an hour after I wake up.

0,"AITA for not giving my childfree child money when I gave it to his siblings? | I have 2 sons and a daughter. I feel I have provided a great life for them. I helped them in their studies, spent time and vacations with them, and even provided monetary assistance with school, cars, etc. The goal was always for them to be independent. That said, the economy has been nicer to me than them.

In March of last year, my oldest had a baby with his wife. I decided to start a trust fund for my grandbaby so that he will be provided for when he goes to college. My daughter just announced her own pregnancy in July, so I gave her an early baby shower gift by creating a trust for her baby.

My younger son decided he and his wife were not going to have kids. That's fine. Personally, I think that's a good choice for him. I would love more grand babies, but he and his wife are not the most responsible of people.

Well, when I told my daughter about the trust, my son's wife started acting off. I come to find out later that both she and my son are upset about how I didn't give them a trust. But the trust isn't to my children it's to my *grandchildren*. Who am I supposed to give it to, their cats?

Personally, I am of a mind that they are acting entitled to my money. I told them absolutely not. That they were adults and could provide for themselves. That my older two children were taking on a financial burden and my goal is to ease that burden *off of my grandkids*. They claimed I was punishing them for being ""responsible"" and trying to force them to have kids.

Well, my son went complaining to his aunt (my sister in law) and now she's trying to convince him (edit: my husband not my son) to start a fund for my youngest. Like a ""housing fund"". I told my husband absolutely not and he thinks I'm being unreasonable.

If he ""wins"" I have to do things with my mouth that I'd rather not mention on my regular account. 

So last Saturday when I was grocery shopping I bought a four pack of gourmet cupcakes from the bakery. Usually when I do this its a foregone conclusion that we each get two. I ate both of mine on the first day and they were wonderful. My husband had one of his on the first day. I noticed yesterday that his second cupcake was still in the fridge and I figured he must not want it so I mowed down like I was a starving chimp. Again, delicious. 

He didn't tell me but I guess he was saving his cupcake as a victory celebration for finishing a project at work. He sounded like a hurt little boy when he got home and said in his adorable little whiney voice ""heyyyyyy you ate myyyyy cupcake"" but I guess he was more upset and I was a bit insensitive for not taking him seriously. 

My side: cupcakes have a shelf life and five days in the fridge was really pushing it. One of us should eat it before it going bad. 

His side: it was his cupcake and I should  have not eaten it, or if I was planning on eating it I should have at least checked with him first.

1,"AITA for not giving people my WIFI password when they're at my house? | Like most people, I have wifi at my house. I also have friends over from time to time, and have family over frequently. In my eyes, there's really no reason to hand out my wifi password. If people are in my home with me, they're there to spend time with me or with other people. They're not there to sit around and scroll through their phones or whatever.

I don't have people staying over at my house or anything like that. People are there for maybe 3-4 hours tops. It's my opinion that anyone without a serious mental addiction should be able to get through that time without connecting to wifi. There's perfectly good cell service at my place, too. 

This became an issue this week when I had a small NYE gathering. One of the people brought their kids with them and asked for the wifi so they could put a game on a tablet for the kids. I told the person no, if the kids are here, they should be interacting with the rest of us (FYI, this wasn't a drinking/drug party), not sitting with their faces in a device, and if the parent didn't want them to be a part of the gathering, they shouldn't have brought the kids.

So with lack of options I took him up on it.  He even let me have his bed and has been sleeping on his couch.  He’s been really nice.  He’s made or bought dinner for us nights.

0,"AITA for reminding my gf about the meals I paid for? | My gf and I have been dating for half a year. In that time, I've paid for most of our meals and drinks. I've paid for all our tickets to events, random snacks and ride shares which really add up. I know this because I use an app to budget what I spend so I don't go over.

I usually don't mind paying but once in a while I'd ask if we'd be able to split the bill when we eat out. And we eat out a lot because it's something she enjoys. I try to steer her towards eating leftovers at times but she'd rather go to brunch or whatever she's craving atm. Anyway, there always seems to be tension when I ask so I try to not do it too often.

That being said, I did begin minding when I overheard her tell her friend that I'm stingy because I asked if we could split the bill. I didn't mention anything because, hey, maybe I was being stingy. But that comment really rooted itself in me and it came to a head recently.

Now let me tell you something about my gf. She's forgetful. Really forgetful. You know how I say I pay for drinks and meals most of the time? It's because she forgets her wallet or it's cash only and she doesn't carry cash. She's the type of person to forget a conversation from an hour ago. 

Back to what happened. One day I mentioned to her if we could maybe not eat out so much because my statements have become double what they used to be. And I mean this literally. My expenses had literally doubled or more during the time we've dated.

This is when she said it's not due to her because she always pays half and doesn't think I always foot the bill. Which is when I got a little pissed. Here she is telling her friends I'm stingy while at the same time telling me she doesn't think I pay for much. I'm thinking she's probably telling her friends I don't pay for shit either. In anger, I list off a bunch of restaurants we've eaten at recently where I paid and explain to her Ubers and Lyfts and tickets aren't cheap.

And that's when she blew up. I mean she lost it. If this was a cartoon, you'd literally see steam blow out her ears like a tea kettle. She went off on me about what kind of person remembers what meals they've paid for and stopped talking to me.

Here's a little backstory. My boyfriend dated his now best friend 3 or 4 years ago. They shared some traumatic experiences together and he says he feels like they recovered together. He also says that they're happy as just friends and haven't fooled around since they were together.

So the best friend's brother was having a destination wedding in Mexico this week, but its been pushed back to July due to the (bad thing). The best friend's parents are freakin loaded and offered to pay for her and a guest to attend the wedding. When the invitations were sent out at the beginning of the year, she asked my boyfriend to go with her. He obviously said yes. They were both single at the time. They paid for his flight and he'd share her hotel room.

When the wedding was pushed back, the parents reached out to him to tell them they'll figure out new flight times once a new date was confirmed. I think it might be inappropriate for him to go now. We've been dating for a few months and she just started seeing a new guy. I brought it up to my boyfriend and he said that she usually waits a long time before someone she is dating to meet her family and he still wants to go. He's excited for the beaches and the open bar. He acts like I'm just jealous and its totally fine for him to be his best friend's date. I want to trust my boyfriend, but this just feels like a lot of red flags.

0,"AITA for booking office Christmas lunch on a day that suits more people even though a Jehovah's Witness employee will be left alone at her desk | At my workplace we organize all social events on a rotating basis and it's my turn to plan the office Christmas lunch. It's always a long lunch on a workday, often with drinks, paid for by the bosses. 

I sent around a poll with a few date options and the two most popular options were a Friday (18 yes's) and a Wednesday (16 yes's). The people who can't make it all have either work meetings or are away on holiday on those dates. The obvious option to me was to book for the Friday, which had the most yes's.

So, there is a part time lady who works Thursdays and Fridays only (call her Ann). She is a Jehovah's Witness and they're not allowed to celebrate Christmas or birthdays. Usually if we have a celebration on a Thurs or Fri we invite her but she doesn't come. One of the other girls in the office came up to me and said she didn't think booking the lunch on a Friday was appropriate because Ann would be left completely alone at her desk for 3-4 hours while the rest of the team went to lunch. It would feel exclusionary. Apparently, when the team has had celebrations before like birthdays, it's really awkward because people in other teams walk past and see Ann sitting completely alone and she has to explain herself a lot. She said that the more considerate option is to book the lunch on Wednesday, when Ann would not be here anyway, so she won't be left here alone. Every year some people miss out on the Christmas lunch because of work/holidays so the two people missing out wouldn't think anything of it.

I said well Ann won't come either way but if we book the wednesday 2 people would miss out. I can see that it's an awkward situation but we are inviting Ann, it's her choice not to come. Surely her comfort isn't more important than 2 other people not getting to attend at all?

My dad’s dad recently died and left my dad a ton of money. Rather than letting my dad keep it or share it with my siblings and I, my mom sued my dad and was awarded almost $500k for unpaid child support. This leaves my dad with practically nothing from the money his own father left him.

My mom wasn’t a terrible mother, but she basically provided us with the bare minimum of clothing, shelter, and food. We never took trips, never had nice things, everything was handed down and nothing was new. We ate a lot of unhealthy processed food. Overall not a great (or expensive) childhood.

Now my mom refuses to share this massive payout with her kids, even though the purpose of child support is to support the kids.

0,"WIBTA if i told my wife using a donor sperm isn't doesn't sit well with me | Throwaway account since my wife knows my name on here - long story short we've been married 8 years now and no kids because of me - there's a genetic/hereditary/whatever situation causing a low sperm count and weak swimmers among those that are there.  Despite years of trying, the old fashioned way just isn't happening.  Ever.

We've been dealing with fertility specialists for a little over 3 years now - early on we discovered the issue was with me and so about 2 years ago I went through a surgery where they removed testicular tissue in the hopes of being able to retrieve viable sperm that way.  After going through this we took some time to prepare ourselves mentally/financially for what's to come with my stuff on ice while we did that.  After meeting with various dr's and not liking what we heard we finally found a guy that seems to be a good fit for us based on our appointment yesterday.  Unfortunately, after reading the reports from my labs he has informed us that the vials they have from me are deemed ""rare/possible"" in terms of potential to retrieve sperm for an IVF treatment.  Because of the situation, we basically have 3 options

1. Attempt IVF with my stuff, spending the $$ knowing full well that there's a ""reasonable"" chance of embryo creation but no guarantees.  If this doesn't work we then move to using donor sperm costing even more dough.
2. Attempt IVF with my stuff alongside a donor sperm at the same time seeing what works and going from there.
3. Skip use of my stuff entirely & just go with a donor sperm which would allow us to use IUI instead of IVF, a much larger percent of which is covered by our insurance.

My gut is telling me it's not gonna happen with 1 or 2, that me having a kid genetically mine just isn't in the cards.  Because of this, I feel like in the long haul option 3 would be the best for us from a financial standpoint, I'd much rather have money for taking care of a kid than use it up creating one.  

Mentally however, I'm not sure how well I can deal with this - I have friends that have adopted, have seen firsthand the love their family have etc, but I just don't know deep down if I'll ever be able to look at a kid that's ""mine"" the same knowing we share zero DNA.  And what hurts me the most about this is how desperately my wife wishes to start a family.  It's the one thing I haven't been able to give her and it kills me inside.  So while my instincts are telling me to take one for the team and help her realize this dream, I question my ability to feel true love for him/her and whether it's fair to bring someone into this world not 100% sure how I'll look at them down the line.

1,"AITA for being mad a my sister for leaving a long planned family vacation early? | So last year my mom turned 60 and my sister asked my brother and I if we should not gift her a little family vacation with us three kids, our partners and our children (my niece from my sister and my son), since earlier that year our father died and my mom could do with a little family time. So we both agreed and planned the vacation more than half a year in advance (time and location-wise). The trip was planned to last four days. 

So one week before the trip I call my sister to make last arrangements and she tells me that she, her husband and my niece will leave one day early (saturday around 2 pm) instead of sunday around noon so that my niece could go to sleepover party. After the phone call I talked to my boyfriend about it, telling him that I felt disappointed that they want to leave early, especially since it was my sisters idea to do the trip in the first place and we planned it long in advance. 

I might add, at this point, that I was never a big ""family person"", my family is quite big and I never really enjoyed spending time with them. I don't hate them, but I don't really love them either. Although I get along ok with my siblings, we still get on each others nerves much more easily then with friends. This is why I was never super excited to do this vacation in the first place but agreed because it is a nice thing for my mom.

So to come back to the point, my boyfriend agreed that it was kind of disappointing that they wanted to leave early, especially for such a (seemingly) minor reason as a sleepover. So we formulated a text (trying to be as polite as possible), saying we found it regrettable that they leave early, that we did not understand why a sleepover is so important that you have to cut long made plans short and asked if it maybe would be a possibility to drive her to a trainstation where she could take a train for 40 minutes (she is 9 y/o) and be met at the trainstation by a friend to be picked up so that my sister and husband could stay for the whole trip. She replied that she could understand that we felt this way and it was within our rights to say so but they would still leave early. 

Fast forward to our trip, some other issues arose and we (my sister and I) had a fight the first day of the trip, where she disclosed that she was very mad at me for my ""passive agressive"" text and started crying that the party was very special to my niece because a recent session with the school counselor revealed that my niece had almost no friends and the sleepover was with her one very good from kindergarden that she did not see very often because they since moved to another part of town. All of this was total news to me. She then revealed that she told my mother, brother and his girlfriend the whole story and they therefore never had a problem with them leaving early. Had I known this beforehand, I might have reacted differently, but my sister and her husband insisted that IATA here. So what do you think?",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I didn't tell my ex's fiance he cheated with me? | Throwaway for obvious reasons.

When I was in college, my ex boyfriend and I slept together. (probably 4-5 times) He was my first, and I will and always have had love for him. He was in a relationship of about 2 years at that point. He never told her about what happened for ""fear she would hurt herself."" Fast forward to now, they are getting married. I feel extremely guilty about the fact that she never found out about what happened between us (trust me, I know she doesn't know, If she did, she'd go ballistic).

Part of me wants to tell her about what happened. Heck, if I was about to marry someone who cheated MULTIPLE times with their ex, I would want to know about it. But the other part of me says it's done and over with, it's a thing of the past, and I should just let them be happy. (Also, I have photographic proof, so I could prove it to her.) I know it's a little late to pull the whole ""girl code"" card, but at that point in my life I'm not the same person as I am now.

0,"AITA for not wanting to contact grandparents that disowned me? | Title is as TL;DR as possible. I apologize for the length, but there's a lot of history here.

&#x200B;

When I was 19, I got gastric bypass surgery. I didn't think it important to tell them immediately, but after a few months, I commented to my grandmother that I was proud of the weight I was losing due to the surgery. This angered my grandparents, and they were mad they weren't allowed to visit me when I was in the hospital. I apologized and told them I'd let them know next time I'm in the hospital. A year later, my mother finds out from my grandmother that my grandfather was in the hospital recovering from surgery. My mother asked why she wasn't informed, and my grandmother responds ""because you didn't tell me about gone-writing's surgery"". My mother, sister, and I made plans to go visit my grandfather, but things got complicated. 

&#x200B;

This sets my grandmother off. She calls my mother and berates her on the phone. I'm sitting nearby and I hear my grandmother tell my mother that she wanted all three of us to go to her apartment so she could tell us what terrible people we were, and that she wanted nothing to do with us. My mother, used to my grandmothers theatrics, hung up on her, and my grandmother called me. She told me to block her number and block her on Facebook and not contact her. I tell her ""okay, cool"" and hang up.

&#x200B;

For a year, everything was pretty quiet until I receive an email from my grandfather about how I was being terrible for not calling my grandmother. I tell my grandfather everything that happened and he essentially just says ""when people get old, they start to act childish. It's your responsibility to be the mature one."" That didn't sit right with me. I'm 21 years old. I have to be more mature than a 91 year old? Who lived through a World War? I explained that to my grandfather and he suddenly shoots back with dirt on my father. Specifically, he tells me that my mother couldn't be trusted because she was a known liar and my father cheated on her when I was 2 years old.

&#x200B;

Thing is, I know this story. My parents never hid their past from me, and I'm glad they didn't. Had this bomb been dropped on me now, at 21, how would I look at my father? How would it have hurt me? It angered me that he told me that, because if felt as though he was trying to turn me against my own parents. I deleted the email without responding, and my grandmother has been calling me nonstop ever since. I don't want to talk to them anymore because I feel like they've completely burned their bridges with me.

1,"AITA for going back in the bathroom after a lady told me I shouldn't be using it? | Just want to apologise in advance for any bad grammar, English isn’t my first language. 

A few days ago I was on a long flight, from Paris to Tokyo. It was a 13-hour flight, and my mum had booked seats for us in the premium economy section of the plane. If you don’t know what that is, essentially premium economy is one step up from economy but one step down from business, people in that section are usually afforded the same perks as business class (e.g good food and priority boarding) but just have seats similar to those in economy. 

So onto the actual incident. It was hour 7 of the 13-hour flight and it was pretty much 3AM in Paris time. The way the bathrooms are laid out in the plane is there’s one in the first class cabin, then one in the business cabin, premium economy is directly behind business, and then it’s the larger section of the plane (economy class) with two bathrooms at the absolute back of the plane. So essentially if I were to go to the bathroom in the economy section I would have to traverse through the massive economy section in darkness. 

I decided I didn’t really want to walk through all of the economy section to go to the bathroom, so I just went to the one in business section (which was like two meters away from my seat). I went, and when I got out, there was a lady standing there, looking super huffy about having to wait for the bathroom. There are curtains separating the business section from the premium economy section, which are directly next to the bathrooms, so I was basically halfway out of the bathroom and pushing the curtains away when she kind of pushed me away from the bathroom and said: “Business class people only!” 

And I didn’t really hear her, so I turned back and I was like “sorry, what?”. And she was like “This bathroom is *business only*”, with a disgusted look on her face. I was so angry, I pushed back into the bathroom and I said “sorry, got to take a huge economy-class dump. My bad”. 

I stayed in the bathroom doing absolutely nothing for another five minutes. I fiddled with the toilet paper, I washed my hands ten times, I washed my face, etc, I took my sweet time examining a pimple on my chin. And then I finally came out, and the lady was MAD. 

I got back to my seat and told my mum what happened, and she told me I was being rude. She said that the lady was right, the bathroom was just for business class. 

But in my defence, first of all it was like 3AM and I didn’t expect somebody to be waiting, secondly I didn’t even take that long and the lady was being pissy and rude, and thirdly whatever. However now I wonder if I was overreacting. The lady was right, that toilet was meant for business class, and it wouldn’t have killed me to just be like “yeah, you’re right” and gone back to my seat.

0,"AITA for telling my daughter to punch another kid? | My daughter is 5. She has been taking a martial arts class for a couple of years to help with her confidence. She is also extremely little for her age. She is very petite and short. She was not premature, that's just how some women in my family are. To put it in perspective, we had to have her school uniform custom made because they don't sell any in her size, and she fits pants typically worn by 12 month old children.

She is being bullied at school by one particular child about her size. He is older than her by 2 years. He will push her over which is very easy due to her size, she often comes home with bruises on her legs and arms from him. He calls her names like midget and baby. She is rather sensitive and is very upset by this. They have swimming lessons at school and last week he flushed her swimming goggles down the boys toilet. 

I informed the school that I was unhappy with what had been taking place, and asked for the boys parents to replace the goggles. I also asked for an apology letter from the boy. Nothing has happened. He also continues to push her, and has kicked her on more than one occasion. I keep reporting the incidents to the school but nothing seems to be happening. 

I told my daughter to tell the boy 'I might have a small body but I have a big brain. You have a big body but if you bully people then you have a small brain.' She insists that isn't nice and even if he's mean to her then she shouldn't be mean back. 

My biggest concern is if she doesn't stand up for herself in any way then she will remain a target, some of the boys friends have already started making mean comments to her. 

After her martial arts class I asked her what they do when an 'attacker' tries to hurt them. She told me lots of ways she knows how to get out of hold or punch etc. I then told her that the boy who is bullying her is an attacker. He hurts her. I told her if he tries to push her or hurt her again it's ok to punch him to defend herself.

My husband overheard and thinks I'm over reacting and that she will get in trouble. He thinks I should let the school deal with it and that I am being unreasonable. He says boys pick on girls they like but I find that to be unacceptable. Am I the asshole?

1,"WIBTA if I told my mom that her not trusting my show recommendations hurts my feelings? | When I was a kid my mom and I would watch a lot of tv and movies together. I wasn't really a big fan of the shows she would watch but I loved having something I could talk to her about like an adult. Some of my best memories are from just sitting in our living room discussing something we'd watched together for hours and hours. 

Over the years our tastes differed a little too much so we didnt watch nearly as much TV together and as I got older (and she met/got married to my step dad) it became less and less common for us to watch stuff together.

Fast forward to now (I'm 24) and I'm a person who loves television and movies. Every once in a while one of the things I watch is something that I'm certain she'll like. Like dead on I know its something she'd be obsessed with. Not to brag but I pride myself on being good at recommending stuff to people. I have a good track record of finding my friends favorite shows and movies because I pay attention to other things that they're into and make notes of things people will like. It makes me really happy when a friend or coworker comes back to me after a recommendation and gushes about the thing I recommended.

But when I recommend one of these shows or movies to my mom she just kinda goes ""Oh that sounds neat maybe I'll look into it"" and then she just never does. There are quite a few of them that I'd love to hear her opinions on, especially if it's an ongoing show. Then what gets to me more is she'll gush about a show she found on her own and I make an effort to watch it and if it's good (usually is, she has decent taste) I come back to her to talk about it and her face lights up to talk about the thing she recommended. 

I've always been kinda bothered by the fact that she never listens to my recommendations, but was mostly able to ignore it and just kinda be bummed about it, but lately she has had a lot of free time and has been actively complaining to me about running out of shows to watch. So I tell her just about every show and movie I can think of that, once again, I am certain she will love. It's been weeks since that conversation and she hasn't watched any of them. She was once again complaining to me about being bored out of her mind and I asked her if she watched anything I suggested and she said ""Oh I never got around to it"". Like in the same conversation that she was telling me she had nothing to do or watch she told me she never got a chance to look into the stuff I recommended. 

It just really gets to me. I don't know if she just flat out hates my taste in entertainment or just doesn't trust me to know her tastes. It also bothers me that most days we don't talk about anything interesting. Just what's happening in the news, family drama, etc. Very rarely we happen to independently find the same show or movie and for a little while have something interesting to talk about.

0,"AITA for encouraging my daughter to stop seeing her father | I know the title sounds terrible but hear me out.

My daughter is 18 and a senior in high school.

However, she recently began coming back from her father's house in tears. She does not have a car, so she can't leave his house, and he severely limits her food intake when she's there. He tells her constantly that she needs to lose weight. He's pressuring her to keep a food diary and he weighs her while she's there. I tried talking to her father about it but he insists its for her own good. 

She was crying over this and I pointed out to her that she does not need to go there if she doesn't want to. If she were still a minor, I'd take him to court over this. I told her that she's absolutely welcome to live full time with me and that I consider what he's doing to be abusive. She decided to cut back to only having dinner with him once a week, but he continued to berate her body, so she has cut him off entirely, with my support. I think I'm encouraging her to do what's best for her mental health, but her father's family and some of my own family are angry at me for telling her that she is free to cut her father off.

0,"WIBTA if I quit my job because I brought home bed bugs from it? | TLDR; I work at a hotel and brought home bed bugs, there are a few other things that make me dislike this job that already weren’t okay, but this crosses a line. Would I be the asshole for quitting over this? 

I am a front desk clerk at a hotel. I’ve only just started working here, but it’s honestly been pretty shitty and I’ve been considering quitting. This particular thing might be the last straw though.

Some background: a week ago we found a bed bug infestation in three of the rooms. On Friday I went into work and those rooms had been sprayed and treated a few hours prior. They had completely taken apart all of the furniture to spray everything, and so we wouldn’t be able to rent those rooms for the night. 

We are the closest hotel to a college campus with a popular football team, so we are always at full capacity on game weekends, which this was. I quickly realized that we had reservations for every room, but those three rooms were un-rentable because they had been sprayed for bed bugs, meaning we wouldn’t have enough rooms for everyone that was going to check in that day. I went to work at 5 pm and somehow no one else had realized this all day, so I was the only one that knew there was a problem. Me and the maintenance guy were the only people there. I quickly called my manager and explained the situation to him, and he insisted that we put all of the furniture together again and rent those rooms that had JUST been treated for bed bugs because we had no other choice. So the maintenance guy put the furniture in those rooms back together while I worked front desk, and we were luckily able to get them put together again before all of the guest arrived and they had to be rented. It was a big fiasco and hugely stressful, but we figured it out.

I had only been in those rooms that had bed bugs in them for a few minutes, but tonight I was hanging out with my bf and he found a bed bug crawling on him. Now I’m seriously stressed about an infestation because I know they can be hard to get rid of.

There are a few things about this job that have also made me want to quit that I won’t get into here because it would take too long, but now I’ve taken bed bugs to my own home from my WORKPLACE. My boyfriend insist that I quit. My boyfriend says it’s unacceptable, and this on top of the other things are not typical of retail. He’s worked retail before too, and he says that none of this is okay and I’m completely justified in quitting on the spot. I told my mom all of this however, and she keeps telling me that this is all normal and even told me that bed bugs aren’t that bad. I just can’t tell what’s acceptable and what isn’t.

1,"AITA for not telling some lovestruck dude he has the wrong number? | So I guess I’ve had WhatsApp on my phone for a while but totally forgot I even had the app. About a month ago I noticed a notification pop up for it, opened the app and there was a video message from some random guy. He obviously had the wrong number cause he was addressing a woman (I’m a dude). He went on for like 5 minutes, but it was really sweet - he really loves this woman and will do anything to be with her, will give up everything, and so on. I felt a little bad watching it  cause it was so personal, but I was curious – you know you would have watched it too. My thought was that I should let him know he’s got the wrong number or username or whatever, but I was driving and just thought I’d deal with it later. Ok, so I forgot about it and later that night I check my phone and I have like 6 more messages from the dude and they are all these personal, lovestruck messages - the guys no Casanova but it’s charming and I’m sure any woman would appreciate his flattery. But I’m hanging with some friends and I just didn’t want to deal with this weird ass situation then, so I let it be and thought maybe he’d realize the number was wrong.

Nope. Three more messages the next morning, and he’s still pouring his heart out how he wants to be with her, showing he got his hair braided for her, etc. But at this point I’m like shit, now this guy has left all these messages and he must know they’ve been viewed and now if I tell him it’s the wrong number he’ll 1) probably be mortified at himself for sending all those very vulnerable, personal messages and 2) probably be pissed that some dick saw them all and didn’t bother to tell him it was the wrong number. I was probably overthinking all of this, so I did decided to do nothing and hope he just figures out he’s got the wrong girl (guy).

Fast forward a month - I’m still getting messages from said dude, and now I feel like I absolutely can’t break the guy's heart that all his love has been for naught and yeah, I knew he had the wrong number all along. But his messages now are super sad: “Why won’t you call me?” “Have a done something wrong?”

1,"AITA for making black jokes while being ""light skinned""? | I'm actually half black, but unlike the rest of my family I'm pretty pale which has been a source of amusement since I was a child. No, my mother didn't cheat (she's the black half of the relationship), but most people usually assume I'm latino or from some foreign country, or that my brothers are from another father and my mother must be white. Like I said, I've always found it pretty funny and so has everyone else. My nickname growing up was white boy and I've always called my older brother darkie in response to that, and it's always been cool. I spend far more time with the black side of my family given my father isn't very close to his own, and consider myself black personally. 

Recently while out with workmates my brother gave me a call and we started up with our usual carry on. When a new (white) co-worker of mine heard me greet him by calling him darkie she looked noticeably shocked, and after the call ended she started to have a real go at me and told me that I had no right to speak that way. I told her that I consider myself black and she had the audacity to laugh at me and then tell me that I was white passing (I'm pale but I don't look white so I consider that pretty fucking silly to say) and then asked me if I was a quarter cherokee. At this point I got pretty annoyed and told her I could introduce her to my entire n\*\*\*\*r family if it'd calm her down.

She absolutely flipped out at this and actually stormed out of the place we were eating. A few of my (white) friends were pretty uncomfortable after this and said that I shouldn't have said that word. I see no problem with using a word I've grown up with and hear weekly from my family members and black friends.

Apparently she decided to contact our boss over what happened, because I got a text from him yesterday telling me he wants me to come in for a chat before my next shift. A few of my other co-workers have told me she's been talking about it with the rest of the crew and is still in an outrage over it.

When I told my brother about what happened and what I said to her he found it absolutely hilarious. He's even volunteering to go into work with me to meet my boss and hang around the place so the new girl can get a eyeful. The rest of my family also think the situation is funny, but my girlfriend thinks that's just because they know me and other black people might find it offensive given I don't look 100% african.

Daughter in law is on maternity leave while my son works full time. My son is a fantastic father who always puts his children first, but unfortunately his wife is not the same way. I recently came to know that my daughter in law leaves the house every single day after my son gets home from work and makes him watch the kids and cook dinner by himself, then she comes back and eats the dinner my son made for her while she was out. Once in a while is fine. Every work day is not fine. I told my daughter in law directly that she is the one staying home, so she should be doing the cooking, cleaning, and child rearing, not dumping the kids off on my son at the first convenient moment. My daughter in law ROLLED HER EYES at me, right in my face, and told me this is why I'm divorced. Then she walked away and refused to speak to me and made my son kick me out. Now she will not let my son speak to me for telling it like it is. Am I an asshole for telling the truth and standing up for my son?",False,False
0,"AITA for asking my roommates to pay equal shares of the electric bill? | I live in an apartment with two other roommates while we are all going to college. They are both out of state students so during the winter break, they go home to their parents' houses. Last week, we got the bill for the period of break and they told me they didn't feel comfortable paying 1/3 shares (which was only $35) of it because they weren't here. 

My defense was that the heat has to be on no matter what because it gets down below zero here and the pipes freeze, so our landlord asked everyone to keep it on, and I tried my best to use as little extra heat as possible to keep myself warm and did things like seal the windows to keep the heat in. Also, I think that we don't actually pay the electric bill based on individual power consumption anyway since that would mean stuff like whoever turns more lights on would have to pay more, and if I'm away for more weekends out of the month, I pay less. 

AITA for asking them to pay 1/3 each? It would be really hard for me to afford the majority of it because I can barely get any work hours in because of my busy class and extracurricular activities schedules. Also, their parents pay all of their bills anyway so I don't understand why they're being so adamant about this.

0,"AITA for yelling at my wife and then leaving. | throwaway

so it was my wife's 29th birthday last week and I took her to a fancy restaurant and covered the bed in rose petals and you can geuss the rest. 

she then told me that she also wanted to have a girls day with her friends and go bar hopping, this was going to be her birthday gift from her girl friends, I told her that it would be awesome and I hope she has a great time. 

now to add, we had a talk a while back about boundrys and we both agreed that strip clubs where a no go. especially strippers. 

she gets home at around 3 completely wasted and proceeded to pass out so I decided to wait until she wakes up to find out what happened, I then realised that I'm friends on snapchat with some of the girls she went out with. I went to view the snap story and was shocked, they had decided to head to a strip club and they got my wife a lap dance. she was clearly enjoying this guy swinging his hips at her. I was pissed off and decided to head to bed and talk to my wife about it in the morning. 

when we woke up i questioned why she went to a strip club and got a lap dance and she refused to answer me. 
I just felt so betrayed because all I could see was a guy grinding on my wife. 

so I kinda let loose and told her how disrespectful she is and that I feel so betrayed and unhappy, I explained that I cant look at her now withought seeing the guy who grinded on you. 
she never said anything throughout the whole speech, and it looked like she was not even listening half way through so I got up and told her I would be staying with my mum   

that caused her to start crying and apologizing, I refused to listen to her and went to my mums. 

my mum is happy to have me but thinks I overreacted, and most of my family/friends agree.

1,"AITA for not wanting to “catch up” at an NA meeting with a guy that I used to get high with? | I’m 25. From 19-23 I was a pretty serious junkie. I was homeless from this time and squatted in a bunch of different abandoned buildings. 

It always seems to surprise people that I went through that because I seem now at least to have the appearance of being clean cut and with a decent job and in shape. 

I’m also a pretty religious NA attendee. I don’t like to share very often and I almost never stay behind to talk to the other attendees afterwards. I just find it helpful and healing to hear other stories.

As I was on my way out I grabbed a coffee as it was late and I had a bit of a drive to do. As I’m getting it I hear someone say my name. I’m surprised as I don’t even think I’ve said my name to more than two people there. 

When I turn around it’s my old dealer, a guy I used to get high with all the time. He holds out his hand to shake mine and I’m too in a daze to do anything but shake it back. He asks me if I remember him and I told him that I do and I’m sorry but I don’t want anything to do with him and I don’t care to hear his sob story about how he got clean because I remember when we were using together and how shitty of a person he was back then. 

I then just walked away and he was left with his mouth open. 

When I went back to the next NA meeting I was pulled aside by the coordinator of the meeting and told that there was a complaint about my behaviour and that I need to be more careful about what I say because if it happens again I will be asked to go to a different meeting location. 

He was honestly one of the biggest manipulators I knew and he had no problem taking advantage of a lot of people, not just us, for money to fuel his own habits.

1,"AITA for saying ""finally"" to a guest who overstayed? | So I know that I'm asshole to some extent in this story, but I'm just wondering how big of an asshole I am... 

I stay with my boyfriend (we pay equal halves of the rent), we're from different cultures (could be relevant to the story maybe). Last night, a friend of his came over at 9pm and they had a long chat. I was in and out of the conversation, but it didn't really bother me since I'm used to him chatting to his friends in his first language, which I don't speak. At around 1am, I was getting antsy that his friend wasn't leaving, so I went into the bedroom to try and sleep. At around 2am, my boyfriend told me that his friend was gonna sleep on the couch. I wasn't happy about it but my boyfriend placated me/apologised/was generally very nice and I tried not to be too bothered about it (+ it was late and public transport was no longer running).

In the morning, we all woke up, had breakfast etc. and by 2pm, friend was still in the apartment and I was getting antsy again. I didn't want to be rude and outright ask him to leave, so I started washing the dishes (loudly) and then retreated to the room to call my family (again, loudly). Friend didn't leave and about an hour, boyfriend asks if I want to go to the park with them. I say no, when is his friend leaving, I can't take too much social interaction etc. So they went to the park, and I was still antsy for one reason or another, so I left the house as well. An hour later, boyfriend asks me where I am and I, assuming that friend had finally left, came back home at around 5pm. Only to hear said friend's voice in the corridor. He was about to leave and says goodbye to me and this is when I become the asshole: I say ""finally"".

The moment I said it, I knew that it was an asshole thing to say, and I felt super bad. I had no idea why I said it and my brain kinda froze. Friend sorta called me out on it by asking if that was how I treated guests. My boyfriend quickly ended the situation by saying something in his first language (told me later he said I was joking) and friend left.

Boyfriend got mad once his friend left, told me I was out of line and his friend had been super nice to me (true). I felt super bad and I basically with him. Some hours later, I send his friend a short apology.

She's told me several times over the years she was saving to move out, but that's always after we have a huge fight (Mostly about her disrespecting me and doing whatever she wants like inviting boyfriends to stay/live here when I said no or coming home drunk) but once things cool off and return to normal she never brings up moving again. My daughter works 40-50 hours a week, expecting me to babysit the two youngest of my grandchildren 5 days a week plus whenever she runs errands or feels like she deserves to go out for the evening with her boyfriend who lives here too.  Did I mention I do all this without being paid other than a $20 here and there, or sometimes just a $5 but I usually have to ask for it and put up with a nasty comment or two before getting it. She does usually pay one of the bills monthly like water or electric , whichever is lowest even though she earns more than I do. I am almost 60, and on disability. On top of babysitting her kids all week, she expects me to have all the kids toys put away and MY house i own straightened up before she walks in the door from work. Yet she has the audacity to say I dont do s*** around the house, and that its not fair she has to take care of her kids and run a vacuum after work(bc of messes her kids make). We all suffer verbal abuse from her, kids included. I lost my husband just over 3 years ago after years of being his caregiver.

Though him and I had never gotten along. Well one night we had a night of us hanging out so it was me, best friend, and one other friend. We all got fairly drunk and we're getting ready to go home, our DD was pulling the car up, and in that moment that he was gone, my best friend and I Locked eyes, and just, kissed. We both went for it, neither of us feel that it was forced.

Well obviously said boyfriend doesnt want the two of us being friends anymore, and I get that, but we've been friends for a long time, and it felt out of line to me. Ultimately she agreed and basically told me we couldn't be friends anymore. I told her it was a shitty thing to ""Pick her flavor of the month guy"" over her best friend of 14 years.

1,"AITA for no longer cooking for my roommate because he dumps condiments on everything? | Because I love cooking and (at the risk of sounding arrogant) I'm pretty good at it, I've always volunteered to be in charge of dinner when dividing up chores with roommates. I'm **not** saying my food is perfect. There are a lot of things I'm trying to improve on. But I learned to cook from two professional chefs, I don't have a lot of typical issues like under-seasoning or over-cooking food, and even when I'm living with other people that are also good at cooking I'm usually asked to prepare food 3+ nights a week. Even if I'm not incredible, I at least know what I'm doing.

Since this comes up later: we have a shared food budget for staples/basic ingredients (pasta, broth, canned vegetables, flour, sugar, spices, etc). Half the time we'll split the cost of meat and fresh ingredients, half the time I pay for them myself and and accept booze, snacks (another roommate is a phenomenal baker), chores, or favors as payment.

The problem is, one of my newer roommates puts condiments on everything he eats. I'm not just talking about things like hamburgers, chicken wings, mac and cheese, or anything else that normally gets condiments. I've seen him put ketchup, mayo, hot sauce, A1, or barbeque sauce on chili, steak, alfredo, fried rice, curry, pizza, red sauce, gumbo, ribs that are already covered in BBQ sauce... you get the idea. And that would be fine, I guess, but he A) does it without even trying the food first and B) completely smothers the food with them.

I've tried to talk to him about this. I offered to make his favorite meals, but even stuff he says he likes prepared the way he says he likes it gets the same treatment. I've asked him to at least try the food first but he refuses. I've explained that it bothers me when I put effort into a meal and he treats it the same way he treats fast food and microwave dinners, but he said it was still being eaten so it didn't matter.

I finally got frustrated and told him not to give me anything for fresh ingredients anymore because I was done cooking for him. He's been complaining to my other two roommates because his monthly expenses have gone way up (he doesn't cook at all, so he either eats out or buys prepackage meals) and saying that I'm being petty and over dramatic. My baking roommate says she agrees with my decision and the other roommate doesn't care, he just wants mealtimes to be less dramatic.

0,"WIBTA for selling what I receive in my dad's will? | Obligatory ""I'm on mobile, so sorry for mistakes.""

I (22M) have a very large family. Both of my parents have 3 kids from past relationships, and I'm the only child they have together. My dad (71) never divorced his previous wife, but has been with my mom (61) for the past 25 years. 

My dad is a severe alcoholic and has a bunch of other health problems. So the talk of his will has come up a few times. He owns the house we currently live in, his (separated) wife's house, and a bar that has 2 apartments above it. As of now, his wife's house would remain her's or if she passes, go to their 3 children. The house we live in now, would be split amongst the 4 of us. The bar and the apartments would go solely to me. 

My mom is worried she won't get anything when he does pass away, so she constantly asks if I'll give her half of the bar. I personally want nothing to do with the bar due it being a cause for my parent's alcoholism. My mom says I should just give it all to her if that's the case. 

I would ask her to at least buy out my half, but she has been mentally abusive to me for most of my life, and constantly sabotaged anything I've done to try and better my own life. I've recently thought about just selling my quarter of the house to my siblings, and the entire bar to them or anyone else who wants it.

With hundreds of millions of users on instgram there are bound to be at least some with the same name as me, but they would have to use names like @Firstname__Lastname or @Firstname.Lastname_ etc., you get the picture.

One of those people with whom i share the same name as is a pretty big influencer with 100k to 200k followers. Again, i don't want to specify because of anonymity. Currently she uses a name somewhere along the lines of @Firstname_Lastname__

Today she sent me a dm asking me to change my instagram handle so she could take it over. She explained that it's easier for her to be found by people without the underscores/periods and apparently it looks more professional especially to brands and advertisers that might want to collab with her.

I haven't responded yet. Honestly, i don't want to change me instagram name since it's my name too and on insta it's first come first serve.

Sarah came to work on Monday complaining that she went bowling with her friends at the weekend, and they treated her like she “wasn’t even pregnant.” Like… what? So, they treated you like a person? How are they meant to treat you? Should they carry you to the end of the bowling lane so you can knock all the pins down with your bump? I just couldn’t join in as she whined about it, and while the others gave her sympathy, I rolled my eyes and got on with work. 

Next, she signs a colleague’s birthday card “From Sarah + the bump!” Why do you need to include the bump in the card? The bump doesn’t care that it’s Rachel’s birthday. We get it, you’re PREGNANT. 

And now all she’ll ever talk about is being pregnant. How hard it is being pregnant. How I can’t be as tired as she is because SHES THE ONE WHOS PREGNANT. How she has to have two midwives because of her anxiety. How she’s sleeping worse than anyone. How she was rude to a waiter for being late with her food but HAHA it’s only because shes PREGNANT.  I can’t hear about it anymore! 

I complained to one of the girls that I’m sick of the pregnancy talk and she told me I was being an impatient asshole. Am I being an impatient asshole or is this something that would annoy a lot of people? Because I think it would annoy a lot of people but after her comment, I’m not sure.

So, I finished my side yesterday but since it took so long I decided to finish the next half today. I finished just now and instead of trying to fold stack and organize all of his miscellaneous shirt and shorts on his top shelf, I called him and asked him to comb through it when he got home and throw away all of the ones he didn’t want. He told me he didn’t want to throw away perfectly good shirts and said that he planned on using them instead of going out shopping for new ones later. 

We talked about that for a bit and I conceded and instead asked him to pick up 3 medium boxes from Lowe’s so I could pack them up instead to make the closet look better and more organized. He got upset and told me that it would just be more complicated to get the other shirts out when he wanted them so no, he would not pick them up. 

I told him I would pack them up for him, and he said that he would TAKE THEM OUT AND PUT THEM BACK if I did because he didn’t want to me to mess with his shirts. I can’t remember word for word how the conversation went, but the gist of it is that: he doesn’t want me to box up his messy laundry because it would be too much work for him when he wanted to take them out and use them later. 

Bear in mind that he does not use these shirts. He probably never will. He’s just keeping them because he doesn’t want to go shopping. I don’t mind but all I want from this is an organized closet and I don’t understand why it’s such a big deal for him to have a perpetually messy closet.

The Menu there was already pre decided for everyone. The menu was only revealed to us about 2 hours before we were supposed to arrive so I didn't have chance to see it, but lets just say management had splashed the fuck out on this.

but I am a picky eater, like seriously. I only eat about 10-15 foods. and I rotate them within my diet, and cook for myself.

I pulled my boss aside (the one who runs our office) and explained that I would not eat any of the food selected and if I could just order off the regular menu this restaurant has (where I would've been able to get 2 but not 3 courses that I'd eat) he said no and that ""I'll eat what I'm given if I want to show respect""

so anyway, the starter came and it was **Broccoli soup**, I don't like broccoli soup so I just ate one of the slices of bread that came on the side of the dish.

The Main Course was **Lobster fried rice**, I absolutely despise lobster so I didn't touch a single thing on this plate and just sat there sort of staring at it, while drinking my water (which I had ordered to not drink the expensive $200 bottle of wine which i didn't like)

at this point I could see my boss might be slightly frustrated with me so I kept my conversation down to a bare minimum.

When dessert came it was just lots of fruit and a couple bowls of things to dip in (think strawberries and cream) I don't eat fruit so I too had none of this.

When it was time to say goodbye the 2 men from management shook my hand but didn't speak a word to me like they had to everyone else, and my boss simply didn't say a word to me. but I received a text a few hours after saying ""we'll talk next time you're in the office"" (I'm on vacation for 4 days now)

So I work for a very popular coffee company that let’s just say has a name that rhymes with BarDucks. This company is not known for being understanding to ill workers unless there is a doctors note and even then a lot of the managers seem to still hold it against you, they just can’t write you up.

I yesterday feeling horribly sick and started throwing up at 6:00am. I tried to get my shift covered but no one would do it. I finally called my manager and explained (in between pukes) what was happening. He asked if I was going to the doctor so I could provide a note and I explained I couldn’t afford the co-pay until my next paycheck in a couple of days, I offered to try and get one then but he said I was lying and I shouldn’t still be sick after a couple days and he would assume the note was fake. I didn’t know what else to offer him (pretty sure he could hear me throwing up) and I told him I would be happy to take a picture of the unfortunate concoction in my toilet right now, he just got mad and said he couldn’t put up with hungover lazy employees anymore. I’ve never called in for being hungover (some employees do and just take the write up or can afford to go to urgent care that often) and I don’t drink on work nights so I didn’t know where that came from. 

The only time I’ve ever been late for work was due to traffic or weather related problems. I tried to explain that to him but he cut me off and said if I didn’t come to work that I shouldn’t come tomorrow either. I was scared this meant he was firing me even though he would give me a clear answer on it-I need this job and can’t afford to be without one until I can find a new one. My sister said he was bluffing because I’ve never had a write up but I couldn’t take the chance so I went to work, hoping that if he saw me he would let me go home. I had to pull over three times on the drive there to puke. I feel like I was an asshole for driving because I could have endangered other people on the road.

When I got to work I felt queasy but thought I had time to talk to my manager, I walked into the back to talk to him and told him he could see I wasn’t faking it-I really wasn’t feeling good. He took a look at me and said he didn’t cater to college kids who party too hard and asked me to put my apron on. I was about to say I needed to run to the bathroom when I felt the impending doom of a hurl I couldn’t stop. Here’s where I think I’m the real asshole; I had a split second where I could have tried to turn away from my manger but I didn’t. A part of me was angry and before I could think of the ramifications  I threw up on him and then ran to the bathroom.

He let me go home and said we would “talk about this tomorrow.” I’m probably getting fired.

Basically, my friend and I are both writers, and in one of my stories, as it says on the tin, someone ends up cheating on his wife and fathering a child with another woman during a one night stand. And while this is egregious on the surface and I'm not excusing his actions, I can understand *why* he did it on some level— their marriage was very dysfunctional to begin with and his wife was heavily abusing substances at the time. His decision was awful, but I don't think it's as black and white as it appears. 

My friend got pretty upset at me for trying to justify it, though, because... her dad did the same thing as my character, when she was a kid, and that's how she got one of her younger sisters. I want to be sensitive to her perspective, but I also had an unfaithful parent growing up and have a much more mixed attitude towards her infidelity, and I think I have the right to my own interpretation of the situation. Am I the asshole for my portrayal here?",False,False
1,"AITA for ignoring the girl who rejected me? | I'm in college and was studying frequently with her. We connected well and I asked her to get dinner with me. She jokingly said I'll have to wait many months before that's possible. It was clearly a no but I was hurt that she conveyed it that way.

I later found out from her friend that she's Catholic and doesn't wanna date anyone till later. That made sense but I was still hurt shed turn me down like that.

Further today I see her in the corridor, and go back to texting on my phone. Didn't greet or anything. Later found out from her friend that she called me an asshole for blatantly ignoring her and not greeting her despite seeing her.

I feel naive, but think I did the right thing. I disliked her for what she did and I wanted her to feel hurt. What do you think? ",False,False
1,"AITA for sticking by my word and not contacting my daughter? | My  daughter was a ""try to make the relationship work baby"" we were young and all we knew was each other.

My daughter was born June 17th 11:20PM 

She was born 24 years ago.

I stayed with my daughters mother for 4 years after our daughter was born.

Our separation was *difficult* to say the least.

My daughters mother was dating someone else not even a year later, less than 3 years later she had a child.

I saw my daughter once every two weeks.



When our daughter turned 13 she had a little bit  of a break, shoplifting, drinking and smoking.

Eventually she was diagnosed with split personality.

When she was 17 it got extremely bad and she wouldn't go therapy.

She  stayed with me for a week, when I woke up she had stolen all my money from my wallet and had gone back to her mothers.

I texted her telling her If she didn't come back within the next hour she has run out of chances.

She didn't reply.

We haven't spoken since then.

She recently reached out to me, shes getting married and wants me to attend.

I dont plan on reaching back out due to the past.

My wife wants to attend, telling me I'm an asshole.

It isn't like my daughter was a child when she acted the way she did.

0,"AITA for telling my girlfriend to go fuck herself? | Long story short I won't go into every detail just the jist of what happened..

My (27M) GF (27F) called me this morning looking to continue an argument we've been having.. When it comes to fights with her I very rarely 'explode'.

Anyway, she goes off on a tangent, telling me that we are just too different. She was getting really heated & I said to her she's got anger issues & she needs to be logical rather than allowing emotions to take over when communicating with me. She goes on to say I am too laid back, mellowed out & calm (which I am.. it's not a bad thing, she want's me to be more aggressive & not so chill?). Here's where the bomb drops.. She says ""You're not man enough for me, I need someone masculine, and no offence but that isn't you. I need someone more manly""... As soon as she said this, all rationale was wiped off the table, I saw red, and I immediately snap back at her and say 'Why don't you go fuck yourself - fuck off!"". She definitely wasn't expecting that from me & she says 'Okay', and the call ended. She texted me not long after saying ""Did that feel good? Do you feel better now that you got that off your chest?"" Not even sure how I should respond to this because I'm still upset. I'm not proud of myself for speaking to her that way, but at the same time I felt like this was a pent up explosion after her berating/humiliating my masculinity & character..

AITA?

1,"AITA to think my landlord can’t evict me just because I called him pretentious | Be gentle, I think I’ve just become homeless.

For context: I live with a friend of mine. He owns the house and I pay 200 a month to rent his guest bedroom. This includes all bills. I lost my job a few months ago and I am one month behind; but he’s fine with that; and didn’t say anything at the time.

We’ve all (me, him and some friends) gone out for drinks tonight. At the start of night I called his chinos pretentious and said I prefer guys in jeans; but I was clearly just joking and he laughed too.

The following conversation just happened:

Me: We should go wait for a bus

Him: no, I’m not waiting half an hour for a bus. Let’s get a taxi.

Me: Taxis are expensive

Him: I haven’t got a bus in years. You forget how middle class I am.

Me: you’re not middle class

Him: I own my own home, earn over 40grand a year, am a landlord, own my own business and I’m elected official. I am totally middle class

Me: Your so pretentious. It’s disgusting.  

He then got upset and said if I disgust him so much I can find my own place to live. He then got a taxi and left me standing  at the bus stop.

It’s been about 20 mins and he’s just emailed me an “official weeks notice”.

Surely he can’t evict me for this! I was only joking; and he was being pretentious, he grew up on the same housing estate as me and had forgotten his routes!",False,False
1,"AITA for going on private property to clean up after my dog? | I was walking my dog in a pretty wealthy part of town about two miles away from where I live. My dog pooped. I always carry a bag with me when I walk her, so I picked it up when she was finished. I didn't want to carry the dog poop with me for 2+ miles, so I went onto a driveway that said ""private drive"" that went to a condominium complex with some expensive beach front properties. 

As I was walking toward the dumpsters, a woman who was getting into her car started yelling at me because it was clearly labelled private property, and I had no business being there. I said I was just cleaning up after my dog, and she said that dogs weren't allowed on the property, and she didn't want dog shit in the dumpsters for everyone to smell, and she would call the cops if I didn't leave immediately. I threw the poop away even though she told me not to, and left.

0,"AITA for not attending my uni friend's wedding? | So me and this guy were friends during university. We were in the same social group, were on the same course. We even ended up living together with a few others in our 3rd year. We fell out of touch not long after university, but I still remain in touch with a few friends and we would remain roughly updated on each other's lives.

A few months ago, out of the blue I get a text from this guy (got my number from another friend form uni) and wanted my address to send out wedding invitations. Naturally, I congratulated him and had a short back and forth about how he was doing, etc.

Once the invitation came through the letterbox, i swiftly replied with a confirmation of attendance.

&#x200B;

However, and this was rather foolish of me, I didn't properly check out the location. I presumed it'd be relatively easy to get to. But this was not the case. It would have been a full day of travel before even getting to the wedding, and the cost of the hotels and travel would not be cheap either.

I could get around this however, by arranging a twin room with one of our mutual friends. All in all I reckon I'd be spending at least £300, probably £400. But I did not let this put me off. After all he was a good friend at uni, and he is the first of us to get married. Also a good excuse to meet up with old classmates.

But events have transpired to make this more and more difficult. The friend I would be rooming with at the hotel got a gf and said he intended to go with her. This put the costs up to at least £500, probably closer to £700. On top of this I got a place on my Masters course which I have been saving for the past year.

It was still within the window of returning attendance letters, so I emailed and cancelled my attendance. He was understanding and congratulated me on getting onto my Masters course.

0,"AITA for asking my wife's friend to breast feed in another room? or to cover up? | This happened a bit ago, my wife's friend was over our house and we were having my daughter's birthday party. My wife's friend was breast feeding her 3 year old son. 

We had a lot of people over, and I don't know a proper way of saying it, but when she was breast feeding her son there were a lot of times where her breasts were just completely uncovered. Like she wasn't breast feeding normally at all. Her son would walk away and she would leave herself exposed.

I offered her our guest room that we have on the ground floor of the house if she wants privacy. I even offered her a towel. She insisted that she was okay. I told her I was like hey can you please do a better job of covering up. 

&#x200B;

1,"AITA for only taking in my niece and not my nephew? | My brother and his wife recently passed away without plans in place. My husband and I have two kids (14M, 9F) already but want to do the right thing.

I offered to take in my brother’s daughter so that she can stay with family. I don’t want to take in his son (2M) because, having already raised a son through young childhood, I know how difficult they are and the entire experience was very unpleasant. I would rather just take in their daughter since we already have a young daughter anyway and the two of them can bond.

I think this is perfectly reasonable since my nephew is young and won’t remember his sister anyway. We think the best situation for him is to put him up for adoption to a loving couple. 

Surprisingly we have been villanised for this despite being willing to take in my niece? They are accusing us of breaking up the kids even though my nephew is too young to remember anything anyway. And I don’t see any of them volunteering to take them both in. I understand it might sound mean, but in the grand scheme of things I think this will be best for the kids",False,False
1,"AITA for mowing my lawn at midnight? | So, yes I’m on a alt for many reasons.

I got a job working night shift about 5 months ago and our friendship fell apart. We were never joke together so we just stopped talking. While we were still friends, he always respected the fact that I had to sleep during the day and would mow his lawn in the afternoon. As of about two months ago, he started mowing it early in the morning again and keeping me wide awake for an extra 2 hours. He does this once a week. 

To retaliate, I started mowing my lawn at midnight on my days off. I have a Cub Cadet mower with headlights, I crank it wide open and hit the yard. He took exception to it and called the police on me, but theres nothing the police could do about it since I’m not doing anything illegal and there’s no noise ordnance in place.

I asked her how she felt about it and she admitted that she didn’t like the idea at all, which I get, so I decided to try a medication again that I know makes me sick (desmopressin for anyone with similar problems) I gave up after a week of waking up feeling sick and was honest that it wasn’t going well and I’m choosing to go back to the disposable products until something better comes up; she then ignores me and skirts around the conversation until she said that she likes me and understands it’s not my fault but still doesn’t like the idea of me wearing products.
In the end I said to her that this is only as bigger issue as we make it out to be, and clearly this is a bigger issue to you than it is to me so I don’t think we are going to work out, she didn’t not take it well and got pretty angry with me saying I’m just not trying hard enough and that I’ve let her down etc...

1,"WIBTA For Asking My Employees To Dress Appropriately Around Company Equipment? | Let's get to the point. I'm the CEO of a small technology startup, think <50 employees. We give each employee a laptop on which they can do programming work. 

I try to be a reasonable guy and let people work from home if they're more comfortable but because every company I've started has had ""mysterious equipment disappearances"" I've installed software on each computer for monitoring. **Each employee was informed of the full nature of the monitoring in their employee contracts**

Occasionally, as is my right, I'll log into the monitoring software website to monitor the status of the equipment that *I paid for* What do I find?

0,"AITA for stepping out as a parent of my ex-step-daughter after the divorce? | I'll start with I (26m) am divorcing my soon to be ex (26f) who we will call Becca. We were together for 3 years and dated for close to a year beforehand. We have 2 boys together (1 & 2) and she has a 4 y/o daughter who we will call Gabby, from a previous marriage that was over almost as soon as it started.

Things that need to be known beforehand

* We are divorcing because she cheated on me, we went to therapy, 2 weeks later cheated on me. While confronting her the second time she had an elaborate plan on how to handle divorcing. She thought this through, and despite saying things were getting better, she was just trying to see how long I'd pay her way through school before I caught her again.
* Another factor is she is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and has been extremely (and successfully) manipulative to me, friends, and family for financial gain, and validation.
* I have had an incident with the law in the past that is years and years old way before we got together, she knows about it, knows it's old news and not relevant to our lives today in any way. During arguments post-divorce she mentions she could say X and the police would believe her because of my past situation. Which is really messed up, since obviously none of that would be true and is ancient history.

I basically raised Gabby since she was 6 months old. However, when it comes to parenting I take the back seat because Becca won't let me parent my way when it's with her. She essentially is playing favorites or thinks that I'm treating her differently when I'm not (she's just older where my boys are too young to parent the same way). I've struggled with this for 4 years - it won't get better after a divorce. I haven't been able to make any real decisions that disagreed with Becca concerning Gabby and how to raise her.

Now, Becca asked me well what about Gabby? I answered I don't think it'd be wise for me to continue co-parenting because of Becca's manipulative track record, that it seems she is just trying to use me as child care so she can go party at night also called ""homework"", to use me to pay for half of Gabby's expenses, I feel like she'd use Gabby against me somehow in the future when it fits her agenda. I also mentioned she has 2 active parents and I just feel like I supervise. I did however offer to have her spend one weekend out of the month with the boys to still see me and when she becomes older she can make decisions on how we might proceed with a relationship. Becca blew up on me calling me an asshole, saying I'm abandoning my child. I disagree since I wasn't the one who chose any of this and was willing to work on OUR relationship before her cheating a second time and actively tried to work on our roles as parents since I've struggled with that as is. I never wanted to put kids in the cross-hairs of divorce, but I just feel like I need to step out as a parental figure and make this as simple as possible. 

Am I the asshole?",False,False

This does not include anything extra like food in the airport; this cost is for food only provided by the resort.

After that, he started sending me really long texts, appreciating what I did, and I would respond to them politely 

Until it became super annoying. I'm a reserved person, I don't befriend that many people. And I'd reply to his texts out of common courtesy. But then he started getting annoying and mad at me if I wouldn't respond.

I don't want to be his friend, I made that clear to him and told him explicitly but he still nags me and keeps apologizing, then getting angry at me for treating him like this because he's ""not like other guys""

It's been 3 months he doesn't get that I don't want to be his friend, my one worded responses to his messages don't seem to give the hint either.



However I also feel really bad because he's probably never had proper social interactions and doesn't know how to pick up on social cues and hints - I've dropped MANY clues even straight up ignored his messages for days hoping he'd stop. But he hasn't.

1,"AITA for calling my dean a bitch? | I'm a high school Senior, and our school has a pretty strict ""no phone policy"", where teachers who actually bother to give a shit would take students' phones if they ever saw you use it around campus.

Most teachers only enforce this policy to the younger kids, but seniors aren't as monitored. Some teachers are fine with us using our phones in our breaks.

Last week, my dad bought me a new iPhone 11 Max Pro. He told me it's my gift for getting accepted into college, and I was genuinely happy about it. Today I was using my phone after I got a text from my mom, who was at the time in the grocery store. She asked me if I wanted anything in particular for dinner, so I was messaging her about what I wanted, until my dean shows up, telling me to give her my phone immediately.

I ask her to wait one second so that I can at least complete my text to my mom, and as I was about to, she snatches the phone away from my hand and begins ridiculing me about how I am a senior and I should know better, how I should be a role model to the kids, etc etc. I apologize to her to get out of the situation as fast as possible, because nobody likes my dean and doesn't want to deal with her.

As she snaps away and starts walking, she drops my phone on the ground. As soon as I saw what happened, I rushed to my phone to see the screen visibly cracked. At the anger of the moment, I call her a ""fucking bitch"".

She immediately goes off on how dare I say such things to her, you get it, I'm obviously mad, so I snap at her again saying something along the lines of ""If you cant hold something, maybe you shouldn't take it"". When I arrive home, my parents confront me about how they received an email from the school about my ""intolerable actions"" towards my teachers. I explained to them what happened, and they told me that the will complain to the school about it, but that I shouldn't talk to my teacher like that.

1,"AITA for not making my 7 year old brother go to sleep? | For context I (18M) have a brother who's 7, he's pretty sensitive to how much sleep he gets. If he gets less sleep than normal he will be all out of sorts the next day.

 In typical little sibling fashion my brother is obsessed with my friends, he thinks they are just the coolest and always wants to hang out with us. My friends who don't have little siblings think he's so cute and always hype him up and stuff. 

Last night my mom left me in charge because she wasn't going to be home until like 1am, and she said it was fine if I had my one friend over because she trusts him. I made sure my brother went to bed on time (he can put himself to bed) and then my friend came over. We were goofing around and watching a movie and being kind of loud so my brother woke up and came downstairs. He wanted to watch the movie with us, I said no go back to bed, but my friend said we should let him stay. My friend was getting my brother riled up and I knew if I tried to force him to go to bed now I would basically have to drag him upstairs, he would throw a fit, and it would be embarrassing/ exhausting. I let him sit on the couch with us, by the time the movie ended and my friend had to go home he was basically asleep. I carried him upstairs (it was like midnight) and put him in bed.

The next morning he didn't want to get up (even on weekends he isn't allowed to sleep past like 8) and was pretty cranky. My mom said she knows I let him stay up late and got mad at me. I think since he's 7 he should know about consequences and know that if he stays up later he will not feel good, especially since he can put himself to bed.

1,"AITA for keeping my son home on Mother’s Day? | My husband and I got into an argument this weekend about a Mothers Day dinner we were invited to.

Our son is 2.  I am 1/3 siblings and all of us have children (1-7 years old) and my husband is 1/4 siblings and we are the only ones with a kid (and another on the way EDD early July)


With my family we always discuss what time works best for everyone especially since kids and early bedtimes etc. We tend to meet for breakfast/lunch more and dinner less. If we were to meet for dinner we aim to meet for 5-5:30 pm so the kids can get to bed on time. 


About 2 weeks ago my MIL suggests (in a FB group chat) doing dinner on Saturday instead of Sunday so that we can spend time with our ""other mothers"".  My SIL suggested a time (6:00 pm) and I countered by saying that 5 or 5:30 pm would be best, the earlier the better so my son can still get to bed on time.   (The last time we got together with them for dinner it was Easter and after staying until about 7:45 pm my son didn't fall asleep until about 10:00 pm) I didn't want to have a repeat of last time hence why I suggested 5-5:30 pm.  


The day before dinner my MIL finally chimed in and said she wanted to meet for 5:00 pm and dinner would be for 6:00 pm. I replied saying that earlier would be better, and that my son was getting a bit of a cold. No one responded to this.  

The day of the dinner my SIL asked how my son was feeling and I said ""Not so good"" he was so snotty that we brought him into our bed to sleep so that I could get some sleep too. I told them he wasn't feeling too good and said due to the lateness of dinner maybe we shouldn't come. 

At 3:00 pm I said “Son is still not feeling the best and as no one has offered to push dinner back to when we originally agreed upon so I think it would be best that son and I not go"" He was not happy about this saying that I'm ruining his mom's Mothers Day and that she wants to see her only grandchild.  I said if she wants to see him so damn badly maybe she shouldn't have pushed dinner to a later time? I know you'd think that 6:00 pm isn't late but his family is NOTORIOUS for serving dinner way later than planned. As it turned out my husband went alone and dinner wasn't served until 6:45 pm.


What annoyed my husband is that I said ""If you're family isn't willing to accommodate our toddler's schedule then they obviously don't need to see him"" and I've said to my husband this isn't for the rest of our lives, just when he's still young and affects my sleep.


I feel like the children of the family are not considered and bedtimes aren’t respected with my in laws. He says ""xyz time"" works better for everyone. But I say ""It works for everyone except my son and I"" and I could have sworn son is a person too and would be included in the description of ""everyone"".


In my family the kids are the priority (when they're little) and we adjust our functions so that everyone is happy.

1,"AITA for not having any vegan options for my son in law at a party? | For context, my son in law has been vegan for about 2 years and is allergic to fish and shrimp. He follows a vegan diet pretty well but when he’s visiting he’s always “accommodating” us and eating whatever we have regardless of what it is.

At our party last weekend we had shrimp and seafood and a bunch of cheeses. I guess I forgot he’s allergic because he wouldn’t eat the cheeses because he’s vegan and he said he can’t try and accommodate because he’s allergic to the rest. 

He was hungry and went starving and then the next morning left and I later had my daughter call me and tell me I’m very selfish and unkind to not keep his allergies and limitations in mind, and that he’ll never accommodate for us again and only eat vegan food that he brings with himself. I don’t find that very nice as he’s always eaten everything he’s served despite being vegan so I don’t understand what the big deal this time was. Am I the asshole?",False,False
1,"AITA for expecting my family to not posts pictures of me from before I lost weight? | Background: I used to be very overweight. I have a diagnosed eating disorder due to my mother’s eating habits and then was given a complex by my father. I was bullied and overall struggled with weight and dieting for decades. I finally was able to lose 150 pounds and keep it off, along with being able to afford some surgery to get rid of extra flab (even though I had lost the weight, I still had flabbiness). I finally feel like I’m at a place physically and mentally where I’m happy. I still see my psychiatrist to discuss these things, but am a lot better than I was 5 years ago.

Now, the dilemma at hand. I struggle to look at pictures of me pre-weight loss. I’m good with pictures from the chest up and if I’m wearing black or long sleeves but if the shirt focuses on my belly or my arms or thighs, it brings me back to a bad place mentally. I disabled Facebook memories and don’t look through old photo albums or yearbooks. I’ve also asked my husband, family and friends not to put throwback pictures of me. They all agreed.

The issue came with my brother’s wedding anniversary came up. He posted a nice tribute to his wife, including two pictures from his wedding. One was just a lovely picture of them but the other was a group shot of the wedding party which I was in. This was before I lost any weight, and it was in the South so it was a sleeveless lilac bridesmaid dress, not flattering to any of my insecurity areas (stomach bulged, thunder thighs showed). I ended up having a tiny panic attack upon seeing it, having bad memories of that time in my life and my struggles.

I texted my brother and asked him to remove the picture of me. He agreed but said that my rules were “too demanding” and that I was doing better, so I shouldn’t care. I argued that it’s a triggering subject and he said that I can’t just ignore I used to be fat. My SIL texted me saying we both handled it wrong.

Am I being an ass here?",False,False
0,"AITA for not respecting my roommates sleep schedule? | Let me preface this by saying I am a college kid at a university in the US. I really like my roommate. He’s clean, he’s not loud, but he sleeps. All. The. Time. 

Whenever he doesn’t have class, he’s sleeping.

After dinner, he’s sleeping (starting at 6 pm).

He typically wakes up on weekends about noon ish and goes back to sleep around four.

I try to be very respectful during the normal hours of sleep (like if I get up early or come home late) but if it’s 11:00 AM, I don’t really respect his schedule and do what I need to do (shower, use sink, etc.)

0,"AITA for trying to tell my roommate she’s not taking care of her hamsters right? | My roommate and I have a loooong history of conflict, but things have been...mostly fine lately. She decided to buy a couple of hamsters, Syrians (who are a larger breed), and stick em together in a KayTee Crittertrail cage. It’s a small cage. We’re both physically disabled and are wheelchair users, but I can get out of my chair a lot easier and spend most of my time in the house out of it, so I built the cage up with tons of tubes (and later revised it several times over the next 24 hours). They were fighting and she wanted to let them just have some time to calm down and acclimate, but like....I watched them and it was every time they were near each other. I told her to get a second cage and pushed her until she got a friend to pick one up for $20 from someone off marketplace. It’s the same one without the upper removable “observation” room thing. I decided to put the calmer one in the bigger cage and the other one in the smaller one (tube wise) cause I figured I’d let her cool off in a simple space. I’ve added more things as she’s acclimated but she’s inevitably gnawing on the bars all the time. (With things to chew on all over). So I researched the breed and lo and behold, they’re a territorial breed and they need about double the square inches (inchage?) that they have, each. That they need way more things than they have, all around. That the cages/brand/material/etc all are really bad for them, they need up to 6 inches just to burrow, I mean the tiny wheel in the second cage is so small she climbs up and tries to run ON it. 

So I approach my roommate about it and she goes “I’ve had hamsters for years and they did fine,” “I’ve had pairs and they did okay but I don’t remember what type they were, maybe dwarf hamsters?” When I mentioned the burrowing thing (she told me to put 𝘰𝘯𝘦 inch of bedding), she said “that’s not possible” and then went off on me and said she knew what she was doing and that she wasn’t going to change because this setup has worked for years and that I made her buy another cage and all this and that. They’re in my room because I have been rebuilding the cages as I go to make sure they’re okay, and I’m looking for things to properly take care of them (and some of it is, in fact, expensive, but that is what you sign up for with pets) and this is just irritating as hell to me. I’m younger than her so she knows it all. I have both her cat and my cat’s food, water, and litter box (that I buy and pay for and maintain) in my room too, but she doesn’t care because she helped when I first got my cat. 

Am I just nagging her too much over things? Or is she just a shitty pet parent?",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my gay best friend ""maybe?"" | She and I met 8 months ago, during our first year at university. We ended up hanging out accidentally a few months after we met, and quickly developed a very close friendship. What I did not know at this time was that she had begun to fall in love with me.

&#x200B;

Our friendship has always been rooted in complete honesty (to the point of sharing pretty much every passing thought), and so she ended up writing a letter to me, telling me about how she felt and apologizing for it, because she knew that despite the fact that I am an intense LGBTQ+ ally and advocate, I am both Christian and straight. After reading the letter, we met up talked about it for hours. I essentially told her I considered being with her romantically, but at the moment, I genuinely couldn't see myself in a relationship with her, because 

1. I wouldn't want to ruin the friendship
2. I wasn't sure if I wanted to date a girl
3. the family/cultural/religious stuff would make it hard for me to not feel guilty in that relationship, which would be unfair to her. 

She was just genuinely shocked I'd thought about it in any capacity whatsoever—and even more so that I didn't give her an outright no. However, because I left it so open, that made it difficult (read: impossible) for her to get over me.

&#x200B;

We became closer after this, and we currently function almost more as a non-romantic couple than as friends. We went on a trip together and it was phenomenal. We text and talk and think about each other all the time, and I can say that we genuinely love each other. The problem is, I am happy just having her in my life this way, but for her, it's like getting so intensely close to something she desperately wants (which is essentially a life together), but just missing the mark. It's hard for both of us: It might be easier on her if I shut down the idea of a romantic relationship entirely so that she can move on, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't deeply considering an actual relationship. Meanwhile, me being confusing and indecisive hurts her, because she's hanging on to a thread of hope that may or may not come into fruition. She also has opportunities to date other people, but doesn't want to—she says that she can't imagine liking someone that isn't me (which I think will change because people always say their crush/bf/gf/so is ""the one"" and that they'll ""never love again"", but she disagrees). Fundamentally, I desperately don't want to lead her on in any way, but I also don't want to lie and say either yes or no if I'm not sure. I care about her more than anything and want to be the best friend for her that I can be until I manage to make up my mind one way or the other.

This is a large bathroom with three stalls and two urinals.  The main bathroom door has a dead bolt type lock on the inside.

1,"AITA for not wanting to pay for losing my friend’s jacket? | Last week, my friends and I had a night planned to go out to a club. I was pregaming at my friend Dave’s (fake name) place, and he offered to lend me a jacket because it was chilly outside and I had only worn a short sleeve shirt. I said yes, and he gave me one of his jackets.

Fast forward to the club. We have a table where it’s pretty much only our group of friends, and everyone piles their jackets at the corner of the table. I end up leaving about 2-3 hours early for an unrelated reason and grab a cab home. As I’m in the cab I realize I forgot Dave’s jacket at the table. No big deal, I text Dave and our other friend who we’ll call Mike, telling them I left the jacket there and to make sure someone grabbed it. I get a response back 10 minutes later from Mike saying “I’m on it” and I pretty much let it go there, thinking everything was taken care of.

8 days later, Dave asks me if he could have his jacket back. And I’m confused saying I thought Mike had it. Mike tells us that he doesn’t have it and forgot about it that night. Obviously Dave is pissed. He’s saying it was his favorite jacket and it costs $230 so how do I want to work this out. So I say I think it’s fair if Mike and I split the cost of it, as I would’ve had a higher sense of urgency and would’ve gone back to the club if need be had I not gotten his quick response that it was taken care of. Both of them are pissed at me, saying I left it there and at the end of the day it’s completely my fault for leaving it there. I disagree. So, AITA?",False,False

0,"AITA For Throwing A Fit? | Parents are divorced, I live with my mom, didn't have a choice. No contact with dad. Ever since I was 6 my family &  mom always gave me money for my birthday or Christmas and I've always tried to save it so I always let my mom put it in our safe so it's in a safe place. And every year my mom gives me money for Christmas or my birthday, but not even a month later she takes it back and uses it for herself.

And she only tells me after we are at a store and I want to buy something then she will say ""Oh sorry, you can't buy that I used some of your money."" Which is basically code for she used all of it. And since I was little at the time I was upset but forgot about it by the time we get home.

She never pays back the money. She only ever uses my birthday and Christmas money and not my siblings money.

So for the last 3 years I have been keeping my money on me at all times instead of the safe and have been saving up to buy a laptop. Because of the large amount I decided to let her put it in the safe because I wanted to give her another chance to see if she changed and if I could trust her.

That was two weeks ago, today I went to ask her to open the safe because I finally saw a laptop on sale that I could afford, and did not have the safe pin to open it. As soon as she takes my money out she says ""Oh, remember I used some of your money.""  And hands me the money and there is only less of a quarter of the money left I had saved.

I'm bipolar, and yes I do go to a psychologist, but it's safe to say that when she told me that I lost my shit. Only mentioning that I am bipolar to point out that she knows how volatile my mental state is and still continues to do things like this.

1,"AITA for visiting friends on Thanksgiving? | (I'm not sure if I should post this here or r/relationship_advice)

My mother (50F) and I (24M) thought it was a good idea to visit Orlando for our Thanksgiving holiday. We have annual passes to SeaWorld and love going any chance we can get. 

Another thing to note is I have a group of really close friends who live in Orlando that I rarely if at all get to see. They have a Thanksgiving meal/party planned for that evening at my best friend's house.

Thanksgiving morning happens and my mother and I have an amazing time at SeaWorld. We leave around 4 pm to go back to the hotel and rest and for me to prepare to go to the party with friends. 

I do not have a license or a car so a friend was so amazing for picking me up from the hotel to take me to the house which is about a 40 minute drive.

I had an amazing meal and got to reconnect with friends, especially my best friend. Everything was going wonderfully until I got a text from my mother saying it was getting late and it's one of the worst nights to drive.

I then replied that's it's probably better for me to stay the night and I'll see her in the morning when everything quiets down. 

This did not go over well and she immediately called me, yelling at me for abandoning her in a strange city. She threatened to leave without me and to find my own way back home.

0,"AITA for doing nothing while my sister gets hit by my dad? | My sister (18 in college 8 hours drive away, winter break for her so she can meet us up again) and I (16 still in highschool) thought the Netflix movie called ""Bandersnatch"" was really good. My sister loved the movie, and I thought it was pretty amazing myself. We sort of hyped up the movie to the point where we got both of our parents to watch it. Both of my parents were uninterested from the start, but the part where Colin and Stefan used LSD was the last straw for my dad. Tensions have been rising from the start since my dad showed obvious uninterested and was sort of making fun by pretending to go to sleep and such, which struck a nerve for my sister. Now, he's mad at all of the elements of the movie, and sees the LSD, stress, suicide: and starts getting mad.

Ever since then, it progressed to the point where my sister got mad and went to her room. My dad ranted about all the elements in the movie and how there's no message. I stopped the movie before the choice where you either kill the dad or back off. He began being more angry and confronting me, where I tried to explain it to him with YouTube videos, and my take. I answered his questions on ""what's the message?"" and ""why are you so interested in this?"" and ""as a dad, I see ____, how am I not supposed to be afraid?""

Now he's confronting my sister and began to be physical. My mom is trying to calm him down but isn't helping at all: she's just taking his side but trying to push my dad to be more moderate. I'm still downstairs however. This happens every once in a while, and it always ends with him getting what he wants, pushing his logic without listening to the rest of us.

0,"AITA for creating a DnD Group after I was kicked out of my old group and destroying a friendship? | In my home town, there's one dedicated group for Dungeons and Dragons for teenagers. I, (16 M), joined a running campaign. The campaign was extremely serious and grim dark. I created a human bard who's a big nerd for music theory who's overly friendly, but also quick to anger. I have a nasty habit of getting caught in the moment and saying stupid shit. That cultivated to a head when we were fighting the BBEG and I called it a 'big dumb shit face' using Vicious Mockery (A spell where you insult a foe and it hurts) and it kills. Me and one other guy out of a group of eight are the only ones laughing. 

We'll call the guy who laughed 'Chris'. He becomes important later. Both Chris and I and friends with the DM. Throughout the campaign I did a few, kind of minor jokey things. The DM pulls me aside and is like, 'you fucker, this was my big moment and you made a stupid joke.' Keep in mind, we are all awkward and hormonal teenagers.

Despite what I felt, at the time, triumphant, I now felt like shit. I apologized, I took my stuff and left. I actually in retrospect feel bad. Later the DM sends me a strawpoll over Discord showing the majority of the group decided to kick me. One voted not to kick me. Obviously I'm angry, but it's not like I didn't expect it. I send a good bye message to the group. I kinda get ghosted by the group, which made me feel worse. I was a mess for a bit because I felt like an idiot and was confused, but then I decided to stop pitying myself and resolved to make my own campaign with my own players, one that wasn't as grim dark, one that was serious but also had a lot of room for comedy and jokes. I create a world and invite five people who were not involved with the previous campaign and to my surprise, everyone joins. This is where it gets bad.

I run session zero and hey, these new players are pretty good, they roleplay and interact. On the cusp of starting the actual first session, Chris wants to join my campaign. I asked him like 'Hey, aren't you still apart of DM's campaign?"" He was like, ""Yeah""... in something I probably shouldn't of done in retrospect. I said yes. New group mates love Chris and his char. This is when things went from bad to worse. 

I receive a message from old DM and he is *furious*. He said that I was so shit at Dungeons and Dragons that I needed to steal his players to have any chance. Apparently Chris jokingly shit-talked old DM's campaign and gave old DM the heads up that he was leaving to join mine. 

Now, supposedly, over Discord messages between Chris and old DM, they argued over me and now hate each other and I'm being used as the arguing point. By connection to Chris, old DM hates me too. One of the members of the old group sends me a message saying if I hadn't made a new campaign, no one would be arguing and that we'd all still be friends and that this is my fault... which still doesn't add up because they ghosted me after I was kicked so I'm not sure most of those guys were even my friends.

1,"AITA for not tipping Uber Eats driver? | Ordered late night food with my girlfriend, both 21F. We accidentally ordered it to her house not mine, quickly realised our mistake but couldn’t find a way of cancelling our order and the app said to contact the driver about address changes which we couldn’t do until he’d picked up the food. As soon as we could, we messaged explaining and gave the new address, thinking he could decide to cancel if it was too far to drive. The app made it so hard to amend our order, cancel it or contact the driver any better. Didn’t want to call him as he could get in legal trouble if caught driving on the phone. He read our message but didn’t respond at all. We saw his car coming and assumed he was delivering to my house with no issue.

He comes to the door and I greet/thank him, then he says how the address was different so I tried to apologise and explain but I never got to. He interrupted and said he only did the delivery out of the kindness of his soul and usually after 7 minutes with no collection would trash the food and move on. He said that Uber doesn’t pay him the extra fuel for driving to my house instead of my GF’s. He paid it out of his own pocket and kept saying how he didn’t have to. I got no words in as he was giving me this long lecture about the order. He asked that I tip even as little as £2 because it helps him out and I saw where he was coming from so agreed to tip something, apologised again and he finally let me have my food and go. The order was on my GF’s account as she’d paid so I was prepared to send her money to cover a reasonable tip. 

When I got the food inside I expressed my exhaustion at the lecture. He was talking for way longer than needed for me to get the point and wouldn’t let me defend myself, but I know customer jobs can be hell and he seemed nice enough and genuine. I can’t say how he would have been if it were not late at night meaning he had to keep his voice down. Anyway, my GF thought he was completely unprofessional, wanted to not tip and leave a bad review. I tried to defend him saying to give a tip like he asked and she’d agree if she’d been there. We compromised and she didn’t leave him negative feedback but didn’t tip or leave positive feedback either. I would have felt terrible in case he lost his job. I still feel bad, but my GF thinks otherwise and I really had to convince her to just leave the review alone. She said it’s not our fault Uber won’t pay him, that’s the company’s problem not ours, he could have cancelled etc. I agree that Uber sucks here, but should we have tipped because he did a nice thing delivering it anyway or was he really unprofessional?

TLDR: Unable to amend food delivery address and could’t contact driver properly or cancel.

0,"AITA for holding a grudge against my “MIL” for stealing my jacket? | So my (24F) unofficial MIL hated this denim jacket I owned. It was denim and was that “distressed” style. It became kind of like a comfort thing for me and I wore it almost everyday. 

My BF’s brother got engaged and had a party at a hotel. I had been online shopping right up until the day of the party and nothing looked right. MIL told me she had lots of dresses and I could choose one of hers. I liked a black blazer-style one but I got the vibe that she didn’t want me to wear it and told me it was “too plain” so I ended up having to wear this low cut red bodycon dress that was light years out of my comfort zone. 

I wore the denim jacket over it, planning to take it off once we were inside the venue. Anxiety kicked in and I felt uncomfortable and the dress kept falling open at the front so I decided to keep my jacket on for the time being. 

MIL comes over to the table I’m sitting at (with some of my BF’s friends and family) and tells me to “get that thing off” laughing and stuff and I tried to say that I would eventually but she pulled it off me and ran away and hid it. I got upset as I didn’t want to be seen without it and got told I was overreacting. 

I have anxiety and am not comfortable in large groups (I.e parties) and everyone knows this. They also know I’m not confident in my appearance either hence why I liked that jacket as it covered up what I didn’t like and I felt horrible about it.

I got her a bunch of christmas gifts that she really wanted - I got her a really nice hoodie that she's wanted for a long time and a necklace and a pair of beats studio 3 headphones. The caveat - she's going on exchange in another country on the other side of the world, so she left to her hometown which she'll be staying in before she leaves to go to this country in late January. Her hometown is also about a 6 hour drive from where I am. So she left for her hometown around mid December, and the hoodie and the headphones hadn't arrived yet. So when we did our Christmas gift exchange, I told her that some of her gifts hadn't arrived yet. She wanted to know what they were anyways, so I told her. She wanted to know what color the headphones were in, i got her black and gold ones (because theyre her 2 favorite colors). She said she likes it although she would have preferred grey much more. So we agreed that when the headphones come then ill just mail it to her.

Fast forward to last Saturday. Her headphones finally came in the mail.....sooooo late but anyways I digress.....I returned her headphones to the store that I ordered them from. Today I text her and say ""hey just a heads up, I returned the headphones that I got you and I'm about to order the color you wanted in the exact same headphones, and I'm about to order them to your house, do I have the right address?""

I guess shit really went downhill from there. She said she was confused, and asked why I did that. And I was like, uhhh....because you said that's what you preferred so I figured you'd like them more in the other color? Then she said ""why did you return them impulsively without discussing it with me first"". Then she said I feel bad now. She then said that she was about to start crying. Obviously i'm taken aback and I say, do you not want them anymore? Then she says I dont know. Then she repeats the line about doing it without discussing it with her. Then she says that she doesn't know if it would have gotten to her place in time. I say of course It will!

1,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she literally shouldn’t be crying over spilled milk, and then letting her clean it up to her standard after I sufficiently cleaned it up? | So me and my GF just got back from the grocery store. We had a lot of stuff so my arms were pretty full  and I was closing the trunk of my car when my gallon of milk slipped out of my hands and smashed on to the ground and the plastic broke open and milk spilled all over the ground. I live in an apartment with underground parking and there’s a drain like five feet behind my car, so the milk is just following the curvature of the ground into the drain. 

The majority of the gallon spills out in the garage and I have to carry this broken gallon of milk upstairs to the garbage and I made small little puddles on the ground in front of the door leading from the underground parking to the building (dirty concrete) and a small puddle in front of the elevator (still dirty concrete, we’re essentially in the “basement” now). 

We get upstairs and I start unloading groceries and my GF is tripping. “What are you doing?! Why are you worried about groceries?! There’s fucking milk all over the place downstairs and people are going in and out!!” And I’m like “relax, it’s literally spilled milk, let me unload the groceries and then I’ll take care of it.”
And she’s still huffing and puffing about how inconsiderate I am and I’m just not even trying to have this fight, so I stop what I’m doing, grab a roll of paper towels and a bag and go downstairs and dab up the two little puddles in front of the elevator and the door. 

When I come in she’s standing in the living room with a disinfectant and a mop and a cleaning bucket and she’s like “no, you need to take this stuff downstairs and clean up everything better” and I’m like “no way, it’s a dirty ass underground parking garage, I’m not disinfecting concrete that people are driving and walking on because of spilled milk. The saying is “stop crying over spilled milk”, you’re literally making a huge deal about nothing. I already cleaned up the spots in front of the door and elevator and the spill by the car is running into the drain. Everything’s fine”. This was not a sufficient answer for her, apparently what I did was disgusting and totally disrespected my neighbors . 

So anyways, she’s downstairs disinfecting a dirty ass underground parking garage because I wouldn’t, AITA?",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I stole my neighbor's dog? | Like the title says,  considering stealing his dog.  For some background,  when I first moved to this house my neighbor directly behind me from the alley never had a dog house. Rain snow heat whatever the dog had no shelter. I called the city non emergency line and animal control and at some point I guess they did something because the neighbors finally put up a dog house. 
Now they've just stopped feeding the dog and I can tell it's visibly emaciated.  The city I live in has high human crime and issues and a dog is low on the priority.  (I called everyone I could for several weeks before the city made the neighbors get a dog house) .
I am kinda concerned the dog may die. He has a shitty dog house(adequate by my city's standards) but he hasn't been being fed.  I bought a bowl and cheap kibble and throw it over to him every few days.  I am kinda concerned this will result in an altercation with my neighbor. 
I considered straight up stealing the dog and taking it to the humane society since it's current living conditions are considered adequate by the city.  I also considered going to the neighbors and asking to buy the dog outright but I'm not sure if they'll go for that. The animal control is unhelpful as the most basic standards of adequatecy are apparently met.  WIBTA if I stole the dog or offered to buy it?",False,False
1,"AITA For wanting to ignore Nephew/being angry over overwritten save file? | Would I be the asshole for ignoring my nephew/family members and refusing to babysit him for the next few days over a save file?

 Its may be a stupid reason, but looking into it I feel like I have a right to be mad about this, but really need to see if its even worth the time and energy.

I've been working on the game ""Detroit: Become Human"" which I've fallen in love with, and on my second round and which I was close to finishing. I haven't been able to play it because of my work schedule and everyday responsibilities because adult life, yay, but was looking forward to one of my upcoming days off to play it.

Anyway, my nephew lives with us and now and again wants to play on MY playstation, to note here he has his own playstation, which I told him was fine as long as he didn't save over files and only played a few selected games. He knows this.

Today, asked my nephew to watch my dog in the house (it was reaching up to 100 and more degrees today and had a 8 hour shift) with deal where he can play on my playstation as long as he doesn't delete or override files and only plays certain games he is allowed to play as long as he checked on my dog so he didn't mess up the room, and didn't use the bathroom well in my room.Came back to from work to play game. Game has been played and file saved over.

All that effort I put into my game, the progress I made gone now. A game which he could have gotten on his own console for free because it was promotion for awhile.

He's still a kid, and I get it that mistakes will happen. But he is also at the age where he understands and where he should start taking some sort of responsibility for both himself and his actions.

I put effort into this game and did a lot of different choices from the first round and it helped me relieve stress and now its gone. I know its childish, and maybe a few of you think so as well and maybe you're right, but I want to be angry about this! This games, my games that I'm invested in, have a lot of value to me and it's going to be belittled because it is viewed to be ""just for kids"". And it makes me so angry because its not anything worth being mad about. 

Tomorrow they'll probably try to have me watch him and honestly I don't want to watch him, or be near him as horrible as that sounds. I want to be let to be angry. 

I told my nephew what he did, which I will state I told him calmly and wanted him to at least understand why I am becoming upset by it, when my mom butts in with ""Oh, I was in your room and dropped your controller, that probably did it.""

Dropped my controller=game resets.

That is my breaking point right now.

The game wasn't only reset but clearly also played on because the point I opened up at was at where you get to play as Markus which in not where you begin.

I want to ignore my nephew, not talk to him or have to look at him. I understand he is a kid, but again he understands what games to can play and not play and I went over this with him.",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting another child? | I became a father at the age of 19 with nearly no stable life income. The mother just disappeared after a few months and I've raised my son(6) as best as I could. 

I had to rely alot on family for handouts and babysitting so I could work. I managed to get myself in a somewhat stable position with a decent paying job. But the hours are long and my son usually spends his time after school with family or my GF. I hate that I don't get to see my son for more than 2 hours on most weekdays, but I can't afford to take a break. Everything together I can still barely make ends meet.

I met my GF about 2 and a half year ago and we've been in a happy relationship since. We don't get to spend much time together, but we make it work as best as we can.

Over the past few weeks my jobs been a little less intense and I've had more time to spend with my son and GF. Yesterday, my GF called me over and told me she had some big news. She didn't seem overly excited but kind of happy surprised nonetheless. She tells me she is pregnant. 

I was seriously shocked for a bit. She had been taking anti conception so I really didn't expect this. She started talking about all the things we would need to do. 

I slowly stopped her and very carefully told her ""I'm barely making ends meet as is. I'm really sorry, but I simply can't take care of another child right now."" She seemed a little confused at first but went on to say that we would figure it out. 

Now, I might not be perfect, but I do take pride in my commitment to my principles. Which usually tell me ""you fucked up, deal with it"".

Which is why I really hated myself for admitting that I couldn't take responsibility for this. 

I love my child, but there's no denying that I had him way to early and completely unprepared. Which shattered my life into a strange panic of balancing everything. I was finally starting to pick up the pieces and build a actual future for my son. And then I hear that I'm suddenly getting another child.

I told her I have to prioritize my son right now. That I was very sorry it turned out this way, but that there was simply no way for me to do anything for this child. 

She asked me what I expected her to do. I answered that I didn't know, but that whatever she chooses, I wouldn't be able to take care of the child. 

She went from angry to sad and then kinda stuck in the middle. She walked out and is now staying at her sisters house nearby.

At the end of the dance however she (I think trying to be affectionate) slapped my ass. I don’t get angry often but I was very at this. I shouted at her and asked what on earth she thought she was doing. 

She looked very upset at this and I might have gone overboard. She went over to her friends sadly. One of her friends came over to me and said that she thought there had been a misunderstanding and her friend liked me and didn’t mean to upset me.

1,"AITA for being angry with my roommate for using our room? | I’m a freshman in college in my second semester with a roommate. I’ve been having issues that I think are valid, but may very well be selfish. I don’t want to act on them until I’ve been judged. 

What are the issues? Here we go.

1. My roommate blow dries her hair while I am sleeping (well, trying to sleep). I have a sleep disorder so I sleep at weird times. But she blow dries her hair at 9 am. Which is really early for me. 
My side: she should go to the bathroom, I’m trying to sleep. 
Her side (likely): it’s her room too and it’s not her fault that I sleep a lot. 

2. She opens the blinds while I’m sleeping. I was sleeping at 1145 am today. She comes back from class and opens the blinds. I grunt so she knows I’m here. The blinds remain open. 
My side: I’m SLEEPING 
Her side: it’s 1145 and it’s her room too 

3. Her bedtime varies greatly, and when she goes to sleep, I can turn on NO LIGHTS. By varies I mean 8-1230. It’s a complete surprise. 
I come back from rehearsals and I can’t put my stuff away cause it’s pitch black. Now, this is fair and I understand, but my main problem is when I’m asleep, she comes in and turns on the lights. And I mean at night. Like, if i go to bed at 11 and she comes back at 1130 she will turn on all the lights and wake me up. 
My side: this is an unfair double standard 
Her side: not sure what she’d say

4. First semester I was never in the room, so I never threw my trash away in the room trashcan. She would throw away everything in there, and then ask me to take the trash out every 4 days. Even though often I had literally nothing in there that’s mine. 
My side: your trash, your problem
Her side: it’s a shared room.

0,"AITA for cutting my sister off financially? | My sister is a train wreck. It's because of her past drug use, being bipolar, lazy and from years of our mother enabling her. My sister is living with my mother. My sister is almost 40 and has literally worked 20 days out of her whole life. She got by from welfare, stealing and sponging off our mother. My sister has two kids - 14 and 4. The dads are not involved.  She's had CPS cases launched against her and was even forced into a mental hospital by the cops.  I am a single guy with a good job so I'd help my mother out (she was living off retirement and social security) by getting groceries once a week (for four people) which freed up her finances so she could make rent and my nephews had food to eat and laundry to wash their clothes. I am a lifeline to these people.

I have absolutely no relationship with my sister. Like we don't speak a word to each other. I don't even see her. However, my sister believes (and has said) she is entitled to my money because she is a ""single mom"" and a ""woman"" and my being a ""male,"" it's my responsibility to support her and I am fulfilling that by spending $150 a week in groceries. It didn't bother me that she believes that, but things are getting more crazy and she needs to be knocked down a peg. Now she's telling my mother and nephews that my nephews can't be around me. Why? My sister is trying to punish and control my mother through me. All I can do is cut everyone off financially to put her on check. It would be my way of saying that I owe her shit. I'm only helping out financially because I have no plans of taking over my mother's role as the enabler when she dies and for my nephews.

Situation is basically exactly what the title says. I [22M] live with one of my best mates [24M]. His girlfriend [25F] doesn't live with us, but she's at our place about 5 days a week and really just goes home to get more clothes and stuff at the weekend. She's *incredibly* childlike. She does the whole Melanie Martinez babyish aesthetic and I'm pretty sure they're into the whole Daddy kink thing, both of which are whatever, that's their own business. But the way that she *acts* drives me up the wall sometimes. 

She literally acts like she's 4 years old. She has a habit of speaking in this really annoying baby voice at random times. Like she'll literally switch to it mid-sentence from her normal voice. If it was just that, I probably wouldn't mind, but she's a habit of using this babyish behaviour to deflect from when she does something wrong. If anyone calls her on something shitty she did, she'll push her bottom lip out and say ""I sowwy"" (literally), and get all pouty and teary eyed like a toddler does when they're in trouble. I've never once known the woman admit to doing anything wrong, and she's been with my mate for the 2 years we've lived together.

It came to a head a couple of days ago. I'm an art student, and a broke one with no financial support from my family at that, so I have to be careful about how I use my expensive resources/materials. I've been working on this project, which counts 40% for my final grade for *weeks* and was finally almost finished. It involved using Copic markers, which any art person knows aren't cheap. I left it on the kitchen table to dry, with a note asking everyone to be careful around it. She, while trying to get a closer look, spilled red wine all over it and completely wrecked it. She didn't message me to let me know, just waited til I got home so I could find it. I was pretty pissed and told her so, and she did the whole ""I sowwy, I no mean to"" bit she usually does. I kinda got snappy and told her ""can you act your fucking age for once in your life?"" 

She got upset and cried to my mate. Apparently, I really hurt her with what I said, she feels like I was ""invalidating"" and ""kinkshaming"" her. Obviously I wouldn't do that to anyone intentionally, but I think there's a time and a place for certain things and she keeps crossing a line.

1,"AITA for taking my bonus and creating a ""secret"" room in my house (complete with a bookshelf door)? | Hello AITA. Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fiancé and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. 

Last year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a ""secret"" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. 

Fiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially ""found"" money that may never happen again so we might as well have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship.

1,"AITA for yelling at my husband after my son Accidentally broke his xbox and my husband got mad? | I have a child from a previous relationship, my 14 year old son. My husband and I have been married for 12 years. The two usually have a really really good relationship. 

My son asked his stepdad if he could take my husbands xbox to his own room for a weekend fest of xbox last week. My husband said no problem. My son accidentally dropped the xbox running up the stairs and unfortunately the thing was damaged beyond repair. My husband isn’t usually a yeller but when we heard the noise he shot up and ran to the hallway to see my son standing there and bits of plastic all over the wooden floor. 

My husband started yelling ‘what happened? Oh man! Jesus! My Xbox!’ And other stuff like that. I lost my cool and started to yell at my husband that he didn’t even ask if my son was ok, if he had tripped, etc. My husband said well obviously he’s fine he’s standing upright, he was just being careless. and he snapped at me not to yell at him. He then left to go in the back yard as he had gone very red which meant I had to clear up the bits of plastic on the floor. 

I confronted him about it after I cleared up the plastic and I told him it was not cool that he had yelled at my son. I don’t even yell at my son. My husband said that he wasn’t yelling AT my son, he was just very upset that his xbox was broken. He said it was limited edition (which I kinda believe is a lie because an x box is an x box) and that my son shouldn’t have been so careless. I told my husband to get over it. 

However as the dust has settled all week my husband has been upset and now my son and he are absolutely normal again and they aren’t mad at each other and even went out and bought a new xbox together but my husband is mad at me and expects me to apologise for yelling at him.

1,"AITA for not inviting my brother to son's birthday? | I was trying to avoid conflict, but I don't know if I made things worse in doing so.

The thing is, my husband and brother don't get along. My brother is gay, husband is on the religious side and doesn't like it when my brother brings his partner for family reunions or events. They're both stubborn though, so they can't even play nice for the sake of others. They usually end up either arguing or passively-aggressively avoiding each other. I didn't want them to find a reason to fight during our son's birthday party. For context, son just turned 4 and we invited some relatives and friends over to celebrate.

Therefore I didn't tell my brother about the celebration because I know him - he'd want to visit despite the fact that my husband and he would find some way to make a scene, like they do every time. We held the birthday party with my in-laws and a few neighborhood kids. When my brother asked about bringing a present after work, I told him to come then and didn't mention the party. That way no-one would be hurt, son would get to hang out with his uncle, and there would be no needless arguing (husband works afternoon shifts, they wouldn't meet).

However, my brother found out through a conversation with our parents about the party and now he won't talk to me or come over to see his nephew. He's convinced I'm taking husband's side and trying to turn son against him and his partner. I'm not though; I just didn't want their petty fighting to ruin my kid's birthday.

I have two daughters. A 14 and a 12F. They are both beautiful, and I'm not saying that cause I'm the mom. They have occasionally come to meet me to ask to join tiktok, Snapchat, musically and all those things young kids use nowadays. I have denied all. I don't want my kids to be influenced and feel they have to do what's ""in"" right now. I don't want them to start to crave the attention that these apps give beautiful girls, because that is a recipe for disaster. I don't want them to get guys in their dm, even if they're in the same age range, asking them on dates or talking dirty to them.

I also don't want their academics to suffer in any way and I feel the attention they would give these apps would affect it. Another thing is I don't want potential child predators looking at my children and messaging them, unless they are mature enough to know not to entertain these people.

A few days ago my older daughter came to me crying asking if she could get Snapchat since all her friends talk there and she wants to be on the group, but I saw these as excuses and I stuck to my principles. They also don't do their chores on time no matter how much I lecture them, so I used that to tell them this in a way, ""once you can handle the responsibility of always keeping up with your chores then maybe you could have these apps"". Their aunt came to me one day and told me how my kids feel bad, how I make them do everything around the house and when they miss one thing i use that to stop them from socializing and having normal teenagehoods.

0,"AITA for not paying for the meal? | On a road trip last week, my girlfriend and I stopped at a rural diner for brunch. We sat down and a waitress opened our menus before she put them on the table (that detail is important later). It was a very nice meal honestly. Our total was around $25. I was ready to pay with my debit card.

The waitress then told us that this was a cash only establishment. Unfortunately I had zero cash on me. ""How were we supposed to know?"" I asked. She shows us some tiny text on the front of the menu. Because of the way she'd put our menus down and taken them away, we had not seen the front. There was literally no indication of their cash-only business other than that.

She sighs and points to an ATM on the other side of the dining room. At this point I'm still apologetic so I went there with my card. I noticed it had a fee of, I shit you not, $9. I asked to speak to the manager. She brought the owner.

I told the owner this is ridiculous. I suggested he let me go get cash from somewhere legit, or take $9 off the bill if he really wanted me to use that ATM. Nope. He threatened to call the police. I said go ahead. My girlfriend felt the same way. Long story short, the cops agreed with me, and we left without paying anything.

I told my sister about this today. She thinks the cops were wrong and I was being an asshole. Because ""you wasted everyone's time over 9 fucking dollars."" I think the owner is the asshole. The only part I regret was not being able to tip the waitress.

0,"AITA for addressing an issue and making my girlfriend cry in the store? | Okay, the title doesn't really explain very well. We were grocery shopping with money I was given from my parents and she was getting a lot of things she didn't need at all. I must have been visibly upset by this and she kept asking me what was wrong. When I told her what was wrong, she started crying. 

Now to explain what was upsetting me I have to give a bit of background info. Ever since we've been dating I bought her pretty much whatever she wants as long as I can (because I love her and I love getting her things and making her happy)(also I know I shouldn't do that and should have been more strict about my spending on her so yes that is my fault) but she asks for a lot and is very expensive. A lot of the time she will have a ton of things at home she could eat or drink but will instead ask me to take her to the store or gas station to buy something. So now I'm here with very little money and she still asks me for things, even when she knows I have little money. This is the issue I had. I was thinking about how much I'd spent on her and seeing her get so much unnecessary stuff without a care in the world frightens me for the future because I feel like she's always going to be constantly asking for stuff and spending money when we don't have any to spend. 

So when I told her how I felt she started crying (controllably, not like weeping or anything) and made a big deal out of it, she kept saying how if ""all she did was spend all of everyone's money why am I even dating her"" and eventually she actually just walked off into the store. I kept trying to comfort her and I was asking her to calm down but it wasn't helping. After a while she calmed down and we left but I feel like she was just throwing a tantrum and made a big deal out of a legitimate concern. I'm not asking this to make her out to be an asshole or get like an army behind me I'm just genuinely wondering if I was wrong in this situation.

Also, is it ever okay to tell the truth to your partner when it's something mean about them? Like, forgive me for saying this but the way I see it she is a bit of a ""spoiled brat"" (asks for a lot, gets upset when she doesn't get it) but would it ever be okay to tell her that? If not how could I address an issue like this without causing a fight or something? Or should I just not address it at all?",False,False
1,"AITA for inviting my father in law to my wedding? | I'm getting married this summer and have been with my fiancee for 8 years, my parents died when I was very young and I was bounced around different family members until I was 16. When I met my fiancee's parents her father took me under his wing and was the father I never had. We'd talk a lot, hang out and go fishing/hunting whenever we'd visit her family and has always offered me advice when I needed it. We've grown very close over the year.

3 years ago his wife had an affair and filed for divorce, it was a complete sucker punch to him and broke him. None of his children (3 daughters) chose his side and their mother turned them all against him. He was a hardworking man and as such didn't spend a lot of time at home so it wasn't too difficult for her to convince the children he didn't care about them.

The mother got re-married to the man she had an affair with and my fiancee invited them both. I asked her about inviting her father and she was completely against it. She claims it would cause too many issues and she can't have both of them there as they'll just fight. His other 2 daughters don't speak to him at all and my fiancee doesn't have a close relationship with him. On the other hand we speak at least once a week and have hung out a couple of times a year if he or I are near each other when on business trips.

I've got no family to invite at all as they've all abandoned me and truthfully I see him as a father, so I decided to invite him myself. He was over-joyed and said he couldn't want to see us both.

1,"AITA for using up our fire extinguisher, when we ended up needing it later? | About a month ago, I (24M) was having a party with some guys I know from work. It got pretty wild, and I was drunk off my ass and thought it would be funny to try the fire extinguisher. My roommates (also drunk) said it was fine as long as I paid for a new one. We had a blast spraying it in the yard, and eventually it stopped spraying. I threw it in the dumpster.

Anyway, on NYE, my roommates gf caught a paper towel on fire. The fire was too big for a cup of water, and so she went for the extinguisher. Well, I hadn’t gotten around to replacing it, so we had to call 9/11. The walls of the kitchen are discolored from the fire damage, and we are losing our damage deposit.

0,"AITA for asking my girlfriend to not use a harmless sounding phrase around me? | The phrase is ""I have a lot in my mind.""

It's very innocuous but she only uses it in situations that cause me extreme anxiety and dread. We'll be messaging and she seems disinterested and gives one word generic replies. I ask her if she's OK and she'll say something like ""Yeah I'm OK, I just have a lot on my mind."" And then a few minutes later she'll blow up at me about something she was bottling up. This often happens at very inappropriate times like when I'm at work. We were once on a date and made a quick stop on a date for a quick snack and bathroom break and she started hardly talking after it. I asked her what's up or of it's something I said then. She said ""I just have a lot on my mind"" and then blew up about 5 minutes later. I had to pull over on a random street and spent an hour talking through her raging and tears. She was upset I hadn't on the date yet talked about things she raged about earlier while I was driving in a thunderstorm. Once after a pleasant weekend she responded weekly to my messages, I asked her on my break what was up, she ""just had a lot on her mind"", gave some vague statements about how she thought about the relationship and wasn't happy and before my 15 minute break was up told me she was breaking up with vague reasons given. This upset me so much I left work early that day.

A few days later she messaged me and talked about it, she tried to make up, and told me what triggered that was a comment she read on a Facebook group about relationships. It reminded her of me and caused her so distress she felt the relationship was doomed. We discussed it and I asked her to not to use that phrase anymore. She got upset and accused me of trying to control her speech.

I recently downloaded the app out of boredom and got talking to what seemed like a lovely guy. We got on well and swapped numbers, this soon turned into a LOT of flirting, him suggesting we meet, he sent me photos, and we talked every day for about a week. 
He told me was single, he’d been divorced for a year and had no children.
Having recently watched a lot of catfish, I thought I’d just check he was a real person. I put his phone number into Facebook and found his business profile with his photos and full name on it. I wasn’t too bothered and what he’d said so far matched up to this business page, so once I’d seen that I didn’t look any further. 
I noticed one day that he’d blocked my number and sent me a message on words with friends saying that his phone was broken but he could still talk on the game as he has an iPad - red flag!
So I decided to put his full name into Facebook having discovered it on his business page, and found his personal profile, his wife’s and plenty of photos of his new baby! Needless to say I blocked him straight away.

0,"AITA for wanting my Fiancé to work part time while she is at University? | Both early 30's. She has a 12 year old daughter from a previous relationship (lived together 2 years). Wedding booked in with deposit for 2021. Just started her 3rd year of Uni.

Situation: In order to make us moving in together work, she got a part time job. We both contribute 100% of our finances. We are comfortable enough with the money we have to be able to have family vacations, run 2 decent cars, rent our house, never want for anything etc.

She has always insisted on working part time since we moved in together, but has always complained about her job, regardless of what it is (through 3 different ones). After her first proper shift in this 3rd job, she complained louder than ever, almost in tears when talking about it. I told her to quit now and look for another job, it wasn't worth ruining her dissertation year over. 

Over this period of complaining, she kept repeating to me ""I'm not a lazy person, I don't want to not-work, it's just this job."" and ""I used to work full time and be a single mother, I'm a hard worker"".

She did, and she has offers of a couple of jobs now, but h has now started dragging her feet about getting started with these new jobs, as well as saying that she has been talking to some friends and that they think she shouldn't have to work, I should just be happy she is contributing her student finance to our outgoings.

She has also started saying that she is considering doing her Masters. Then her PGCE (teaching qualification).

I am starting to get big ""I don't want to work"" vibes in general, which will definitely impact our future plans. Wedding, having a kid , buying a house. I am not down for having a child out of wed-lock and as I say we are both in our 30's, so it's not like we have an indefinite amount of time to do that.

Now, I've never thrown my income in her face and dismiss the disparity if she raises it, but I used to have ~£1500 disposable income before we moved in together, I now have none. I'm now getting concerned that she is more interested in extending the length of time that she doesn't have to work, rather than building our life together that we have had planned.

Whenever we talk about it (it keeps coming back up), I say the same. Working part time and being at university is not impossible (her brother did it, my sister did it, one of my best friends worked full time while at Uni). That yes, we could get by without her wage, but things would be tighter and may impact our wedding/future plans. Especially if she is planning on doing her masters and putting off getting into work by another year, which definitely would put a spanner in our plans and we would have to reconsider buying a house and having a child. If she needs more time, that she should try cutting down on things like reading facebook or watching TV alone in the middle of the day rather than dropping work. It's only 10 more months.

1,"AITA for refusing to buy my gf’s family Christmas presents because I don’t celebrate the holiday? | Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I’m Asian-American and my gf is white and Christian. We’ve been together for 3 years and we usually spend the Christmas break apart. She goes to her family and I go to mine, even though we don’t celebrate Christmas (like really don’t, not even a tree). 

A few weeks ago she asked me to buy her family presents this year so she could bring it to them. She said her sisters new bf who’s Jewish will send presents to their whole family even tho he doesn’t celebrate either. I say that’s great for him but unfair to place that expectation on me. She says that’s not the point and accuses me of being a cheapskate since I receive Christmas presents from her whole family every year. I say it’s their choice and while I appreciate the presents it’s not right to force me to practice a tradition I don’t believe in.

1,"AITA for not telling my fiancée about my past? | So a little background info here. Between the ages of 13-17, I was a pretty shitty teen who got into a lot of trouble. From smoking weed, underage drinking, skipping school, getting into fights, and stealing my neighbor's car for a joyride. I ended up in juvie at 16 and didn't really start to change my life around until a year later when my mom passed away. That will always be one of my greatest regrets, but this post isn't about that.

After completing several programs and doing a ton of community service, I was able to get my records sealed at 18 and get a fresh start in life. I got my GED, went to college, got a job that I've been at for 9 years now and am currently in an upper management role. My life has taken a complete 180. I'm a law-abiding citizen. I bought a house a couple years ago, my student loans and both my cars are paid off. I don't ever look back at the past, just focus on what's ahead. I have even completely avoided people from my past, especially those I know never grew up from that teenager phase.

I recently got engaged to a woman I had dated for 2 years. While I've shared many things about my life with her, I've never talked about my past as a juvenile delinquent. I just never thought it was important enough to bring up or that it would have any meaning in our relationship. I'm 33 now, so everything happened 16 years ago. I've made big changes in my life, and who I was as a teenager literally has nothing to do with who I am now as an adult.

When my fiancée posted our engagement photos on her social media, one of her online friends from a group pointed out that she knew me. This sparked a private conversation between my fiancée and her, where my fiancée learned that this woman used to party with me as well as buy weed from me back in high school. The woman also mentioned I went to juvie and she never saw me again, so she was curious about how I was doing. Obviously this was all news to my fiancée, who immediately texted me and said we needed to talk when I got home.

Well I've been home for a couple hours now, and my ""talk"" with my fiancée has consisted of her ranting at me for 45 minutes. She feels like I was trying to hide my past from her, doesn't understand why I never mentioned it to her, feels like I'm hiding other things about myself, etc. She's angry and embarrassed that she had to find all this out from an online acquaintance and not directly from the source. I have not apologized to my fiancée, because I don't feel that I have anything to be sorry for. My years as a teenager are not relevant to my current way of living, and it wasn't something I felt needed to be shared nor do I feel I should be judged for my idiocy back then.

0,"AITA for (jokingly) calling an 18 year old out for dating a 14 year old? Everyone got mad at me. | This happened like two hours ago, and although it’s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.

I’m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We’re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).

One of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)

Before she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.

Ashley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said “it just sounds like they’re both really insecure” and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).

I chimed in (this was a group convo) “it sounds like all 3 of you are insecure”. And Ashley goes “What? What did I do?” And I replied “date a 14 year old.” 

NOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn’t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. 

She got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was “too far”. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified “that was just for *insert my name here*”

We then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone’s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she’s no longer upset)

But I don’t think I was in the wrong, it’s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.

0,"AITA for declining to be my BIL and SILs surrogate even though they seem to need me? | I saw a post similar to this and wanted to see if I truly was TA. It happened about a month or so ago. 

My husband and I have been married for about 7 years now and, while we do plan on having kids, it's just not for us right now. Everytime someone brings it up, I just tell them we'll have one in 10 years. Thing is, I've been saying that for the past 7 years so 10 years have just been some sort of automatic reaction. 

My SIL through married on my husband's side, Eve, has been having a difficult time getting pregnant. She and Adam were thinking of looking into getting a surrogate and want it to be someone in the family (either side apparently) so that the baby at least has some sort of tie to the family in a way. They, mostly Eve, asked me if I would be willing to do it. While the thought of getting paid was nice, ultimately I declined. They pushed for an answer and I said: ""I dont want to get pregnant and have to get away my baby. I don't think I could handle that. Husband and I do want kids eventually.""

Adam was upset but not as upset as Eve. She was really banking on me being the surrogate since my husband and I were the only ones on that side of the family that havent had kids yet and sort of brought up the fact that if we dont have kids by now, we're probably never going to have them, and that she and Adam have been struggling and wanted the baby to be from family. 

Eve hasn't been replying to me and now I'm getting more and more questions as to why we havent had kids by now. The 10 years answer hasn't been cutting it. Adam offered slightly more money and my husband told him to go **** off. But it seems like their marriage is heading towards a bad territory because of this.

0,"AITA for telling my coworker about the gossip in our office that she is having an affair? | For some time now, there has been gossip in our office about two of my coworkers (I’ll call them Allen and Alice) who, for some of our other coworkers (I’ll call them Susans) are too close for comfort. Both Allen and Alice are married. I stayed out of it because I personally thought that they’re just more comfortable with each other since they come from the same home town, plus the things they do that my coworkers find suspect honestly seem harmless to me.

We all used to be part of the same team, but last year our team was split into two, with Allen leading Team A and Alice leading team B which I and the Susans are part of. Allen and his team transferred to another floor, but he continued to be close to Alice. When one of his clients gifted him a weekend stay for his team at a resort the client owns, he invited Alice to go with them. Alice said that our team mates might feel hurt that she was invited and they were not, so Allen extended the invitation to our team as well. The Susans happily accepted and we all spent a fun weekend at the client’s resort.

When we got back to the office last Monday, the Susans were talking about Allen and Alice again, and the gossip was a lot worse. Apparently, some people saw some things happen during our stay at the resort. This made me angry because we had just been to a vacation thanks to Alice and Allen, and here are these people gossiping about them. I spoke up and told the Susans that if Allen and Alice were having an affair, then why would they do anything during a vacation with coworkers when they could just meet up somewhere without anyone knowing.

I don’t know what I was thinking, but before I went home I decided to talk to Alice and finally told her about the gossip about her and Allen. She looked surprised and saddened, but she thanked me and said she appreciates that I told her.

On Tuesday I learned that she filed for a two week leave and will not be back until July. The Susans don’t know what I told Alice and are talking about possible reasons for her leave. I sent Alice a message saying that I hope she’s doing fine, she replied with thank you but asked that I not contact her until she is back.

I told my husband what happened. He said that I should’ve stopped at telling the Susans off and that I shouldn’t have gone to Alice. He said that my anger at the Susans made me insensitive to how telling Alice about the gossip could affect her, and her relationship with everyone in our office. He said that telling her just made the situation worse, regardless if the gossip is true or not. Now that Alice knows that her coworkers are talking about/have talked about her and Allen, there is no chance that the issue will just quietly go away on its own. She will always be conscious about her friendship with Allen and her relationship with us, her coworkers.

1,"WIBTA if I sued an out of work social worker for bailing on a lease | I own (and live in) a four family apartment building- I’m no slum lord its a very well maintained building in a very nice area. A school social worker signed a lease on March 13th to move in on April 1. On March 20th she texted me saying she won’t be moving in now because she won’t be able to afford it now that schools are canceled. I responded saying it was my understanding that school workers were getting paid leave. She said they are getting paid for April and May but she won’t be able to do summer school so she can’t afford the apartment now. I responded that if she’s asking to be released from her lease she should submit that request via email or letter since a text message has little to no legal bearing and I would talk to my lawyer about options. She never responded or emailed and did not answer when I attempted to call her. 

My lawyer says I have 3 options: 
1. Just let her off the hook and find a new tenant- which most likely will have a move in date later than April 1 and result in a loss for me.

2. Find a new tenant and charge her the prorated rent for the days after April 1st the apartment was vacant. It’s $1,000/ month so $33.33/day- if the replacement tenant cant move in until April 15 I would sue her for $500.

This confused me because she's been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a couple years ago, and I was under the impression the military did not take people like that in. 

I messaged her and asked her if she had disclosed her previous mental illnesses to the military. She said she hadn't because she knew she would not have been let in even though she felt ""fine"" now. 

I called her recruiter and told him that she has a history of mental illness that she did not disclose. I was doing this out of worry for her. If the military finds out she lied, she could go to prison. He told me he would talk to me step daughter about it. 

The next day, she calls me and was very upset on the phone. She asked me why would I ever say that and put her future in jeopardy. I told her that SHE was the one putting her future in jeopardy by lying to the US government! She said some very vile things to me and that was the last I've heard of her.

She’s also handy in the garden and cooks us dinner every night. 

We are both disabled after a car accident a few years ago and although we are mobile we are always in pain. On top of that we both work so all in all my daughter being at home (she has no desire to look for a job) is working out as a blessing for us at the moment as she provides a measure of security. 

We decided to charge the 22 year old rent a few months ago, just a couple hundred quid, nothing overly cruel. We have 2 houses, one we all live in and another we have on rent, but the money that we are charging her is going into the general household pot since both girls have expensive tastes and so grocery bills and electricity bills are high.

1,"AITA for not inviting my youngest brother to my wedding retreat? | I (31M) am getting married next year. Rather than a traditional wedding, my fiancée (30F) and I have planned a group trip to one of the most beautiful places in the world. We've booked an excursion package that will take us and our guests to various spas/tourist locations/etc. and we plan to do the actual wedding ceremony on the last day of the trip. Following that, our guests will go home, and my then-wife and I will travel elsewhere for another week as our honeymoon. 

The problem is: the excursion package we booked is limited to 14 people, including my fiancée and I. If we wanted a bigger group, we'd have to upgrade to the next package, which would be considerably more pricey and not within our allocated wedding budget. 

My fiancée and I have planned out the guest list as follows: my mother, her parents, her twin sister, her two younger brothers, my four older siblings, and two very close mutual friends of ours. 

Here's the thing. Though my older siblings and I are all very close in age, my mother got pregnant again by a different father when I was 12. My mother was doing very poorly at the time (financial struggles, problems with addiction, ongoing depressive episodes) and didn't feel capable of taking care of another child. So, my youngest brother ended up getting raised primarily by my mother's cousin, though he's been living at home with my mom since he was 14.

He's now 19, and unfortunately neither I nor my other siblings are very close with him. We see him on major holidays and occasionally when we all visit home, but due to both the age difference and the fact that he wasn't raised by our mother we just haven't been able to maintain a significant relationship. 

When my fiancée and I were putting together the guest list, I considered including him, but with the strict limitations on guest numbers it came down to him vs. one of my best friends. Honestly, I'm far closer with my friend. 

After we invited everyone, my mom called me to tell me that my brother was incredibly upset that he hadn't been invited. She said that she couldn't believe that I would leave him out of a family event like this, especially as he's been left out of so much ""family stuff"" throughout his life. But my other siblings agree with me – none of them are very close with him either, and they know they wouldn't chose him over their best friends if the choice had to be made. 

I feel bad about hurting his feelings, but I still think it's my and my fiancée's decision who we invite to our wedding.

That said, my 13 year old cousin recently announced that she too is expecting. Again- this child is in the eighth grade. Against all better judgement and even the option to give the baby up for adoption to a close family member who so desperately want a child, she has decided that she is going to keep and raise the baby herself with her ninth grade boyfriend.

0,"AITA for reporting a teacher to the school district/school board? | Here’s the background. My son “Danny” has been dating a girl for about six months. “Tracy” is in the same grade at a different school nearby. Additionally, Tracy’s mom “Susan” is a teacher in yet another school all these are in the same district. 
I guess Susan got curious about Danny and his grades. So she contacted someone she knows at Danny’s school to pull up his grades. She then proceeded to tell Tracy she can no longer see Danny because his grades didn’t meet her standards. 
I’m so mad right now. I feel she had absolutely no business looking up my sons information. She had no legitimate reason to do so.  
I fired off emails to the principals of Susan’s school and my son’s school. I also copied the superintendent. 
I was venting to my sister about it and she said I went over the top and should have just let it go. I’m floored and just don’t understand.  This has to be a violation of privacy or something.  
So AITA?  I fail to see where I am wrong here.  Maybe I should have waited. I don’t know.  I got so mad so fast.",False,False
0,"AITA for not adopting and instead choosing to have a baby via surrogacy? |  My partner and I are both guys in our late 20's. Yesterday the topic of children came up and I said if we were to ever have children I'd want to go the surrogate route rather than adoption. Somehow the conversation changed to how much suffering children are in and how much it would mean to them to find a home. He said that having a baby via surrogacy is selfish when adoption is an option to which I reminded him practically every straight person is selfish then. He went on to say that he wouldn't want to pass his genes (for some reason? He's attractive and seems to have no medical issues) & I said I'll gladly take the role then. We haven't spoken to each other since and it's been bugging me, Aita?

1,"AITA for telling a mom she shouldn't be asking for donations to buy her kid an ipad? | My town has a facebook group where people discuss local issues or just post whatever. This woman made a post telling everyone how she's a single mom struggling to make ends meet, and needs help to buy her daughter an ipad for her birthday, which she claims she really needs for school, and she asked for donations. To my surprise, her post received dozens of replies with people supporting her and offering her money. I commented that I felt it was inappropriate to ask strangers to buy her kid what was essentially a very expensive toy. I also pointed out that there are many much cheaper alternatives to ipads (walmart sells an android tablet for under $100). She responded that it is NOT a toy and the daughter absolutely needs it for school, and also only apple tablets are any good, and besides her daughter has her heart set on an ipad, and also other kids will bully you if your tablet isn't an apple. A lot of commenters jumped on me and called me all sorts of names and not a single person took my side. I don't have any kids and I'm not really struggling financially so maybe that makes it hard for me to sympathize with her but I still feel like I'm right. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for bringing my small dog to Target? | I’m often at my local Target and almost every time I go there is someone with their dog. I’m a dog owner and lover, so I often talk to the owners and pet the dogs. None of the dogs I’ve encountered have been service dogs. I’ve seen dogs of all sizes, from purse dogs to quite large dogs walking on a leash (including a Newfoundland). 

Months ago I was running errands with my mom, and we had my dog who is a 20 pound terrier with us. Every where we needed to go was pet friendly so we brought with her us. I remembered I needed a couple of things at  Target and I thought it would be fine to pop in quickly since I have seen so many dogs there. I was unsure of their formal policy, but I thought it would be ok due to what I have seen. I also figured if any employee or person told me she wasn’t allowed, I would leave immediately, no problem. 

We put her in the cart and I tried to be quick. I don’t think we were there for more than 15 minutes. Plenty of people petted her and said how cute she was, including Target employees. No one ever said anything to me and I never saw anyone give me a bad look. 

At one point, my pup looked so sweet with her paws up on the cart, my mom took a photo and I shared it to social media later that day.

Since I’ve posted that photo, I keep having random accounts telling me that dogs are not allowed at Target. Good to know. Now I know and I won’t be bringing her back, but it’s a cute picture so I have not deleted it. Plus, for once my caption game was on point with, “Bitches be shopping.”

I got very furious why noone of the girls stepped between them. I asked her boyfriend if this is ok for him and he was like 'yeah its fine' but you could hear the sadness in his voice. So I took things in my own hands and went to his gf and told her that this is not ok, even when her bf is at the same event. She got angry of course and shoutet at me, telling me to mind my own business. After that my gf went to me and said that I ruined her night because of that.

Anyway went to the toilet and came out fuming asking who took the last piece of tp. I was startled and said that I did, but there was still toilet paper in the toilet room, just on the shelf, but you have to kind of half stand up to get it. Anyways she started insulting me because I didn't put a new roll on the holder, I told her there was still toilet paper in the room and she could just stand up and get it herself, she said that she would pee on herself so idk, was that my fault?

1,"AITA for being upset that my son didn’t tell me he is gay? | I have a 19 year old son, Jack. I had him very young. Me and his mom married at 20. 

I was an alcoholic when Jack was growing up and when he was eight, I had an affair with another woman and had another son “Daren”. Me and Jack’s mom got a divorce. 

This kind of forced me to sober up and I’ve been sober 11 years now. I moved about six hours away to raise Daren and I married Daren’s mother. 

Me and Jack’s mom aren’t on the best of terms and I saw Jack a few times a year, although I would always send him money. 

I was up to visit Jack’s uncle (we’ve always been buddies) and he asked me how Jack’s boyfriend was doing. I asked him what he meant and he just repeated that he saw some pictures of Jack and his boyfriend and he was wondering how they were doing. 

I mumbled some excuse that they were fine and left shortly after. As soon as I got in my car I called Jack. I told him what his uncle told me and I was pretty upset that he thought he couldn’t confide in me. 

Jack started to cry and basically started ranting about how I “abandoned” him and his Mom when he was young and how I’ve “always preferred Daren” to him and that’s why he didn’t tell me because he feels like he doesn’t matter to me. 

I tried to explain myself and I said that I understand that I’ve been a shitty father sometimes but I love him and I don’t care that he’s gay. 

He told me that he didn’t know if he was ever going to tell me because I’m an “asshole” and I have no right to get upset about not knowing something about him after I abandoned him so long ago. He then hung up on me. 

I haven’t told my wife or Daren what’s happened and I don’t want to until I work through all this and gain some perspectives on what happened.

1,"AITA for playing music in the middle of the day when my roommate has a weird sleep schedule? | So I live in a 3 bedroom duplex with 2 other girls. The duplex is laid out with two bedrooms up stairs with a bathroom in the middle. Downstairs is the living room, kitchen, dining room and roomates room and her own bathroom. 

When we picked rooms I picked first because I moved in first and then my roommate upstairs picked and then the girl downstairs. She wasn’t too happy with her room because it was the smallest and the location but settled because she had her own bathroom. 

So the roommate downstairs has a very weird schedule. Sometimes she works nights and sometimes mornings. Sometimes she has 5 hour days and other days she can work 13. So obviously with the constant changing work schedule her sleeping schedule has became very weird and erratic and we never know when she’s asleep now. 

So since I can never guess when she’s asleep I often so downstairs in the kitchen and make food and play music on my speaker while I meal prep. It’s apart of my routine through out the day that i really enjoy since I don’t work till 2pm. 

But yesterday my roommate downstairs texted our group chat and asked us to please stop playing music in the kitchen at any time of the day. She said it wakes her up almost every time and when she is a wake it’s just very disruptive. My other roommate said sure but I said that’s not really fair because she often plays music too in the kitchen. She told me it wasn’t really fair that she had the shittiest room in the house and that if I wanted to switch with her so she wouldn’t have to be woken up by it that would be fine. Of course I said no and said I was going to keep playing music because it’s noon usually when I do it and it’s ridiculous I have to step around her schedule. 

Both my roommates are saying I’m being an asshole and that it’s the least I can do because I have the best room in the house because it’s the most separate. I honestly think they are being assholes because why should I have to be so quiet I’m the middle of the day!?",False,False

It was a drunken random thing, we didn’t think of birth control because my fiancé has always had the implant.
The woman wanted to keep the pregnancy.
After a lot of discussions with everyone involved, A and I decided to legally adopt the baby. The birth mother didn’t want to be involved, and wanted a a closed adoption. 

My daughter is 2 months old now and my fiancé and I been having a difficult time. Obviously our parents know the situation. No one else really knew we were getting ready for a baby.
We haven’t had the full on family friends effect yet because of what’s going on so we haven’t dealt with it yet. But A doesn’t want anyone else to know how our kid was made. Obviously she wasn’t pregnant, so they know she’s not A’s. A wants us to tell people we just adopted but I don’t. I don’t want to hide the fact that I’m my daughter’s bio father. I’m proud of it to be honest. I don’t feel the need to lie and I don’t think lying will just snowball. She then said let’s come up with a surrogate story but what, she’s going to tell people she can’t naturally conceive? What happens if we want more kids down the line and she’s pregnant. 

I’m pretty against lying for most things, I don’t think there’s ever a good reason to lie and that the truth will come out. I understand it being an odd situation but I guess I don’t fully grasp what she’s feeling here.",False,False

1,"AITA for writing a song dedicated a college coed who went missing in our town a few years ago? | Using a Throwaway because contrary to some of the allegations that have been leveled against me I am not doing this for self promotion. I will also not name the girl because while it’s been very public I don’t want to bring attention to her family.

So several years ago a 20-year-old coed went missing in my hometown, well there have been several semi breaks in the case nothing has ever come of her disappearance. I always thought she was a beautiful young girl in the case deeply affected me because it was so close to home.

Maybe a year or so ago I was  up in the middle the night and sort of inspiration hit me and I wrote a song about the disappearance. I think it’s very good and very genuine and if nothing else it brings attention back to the case and it seems like it’s stalled out. I sent a copy of the song to her family and they basically responded with “we appreciate your effort’s but this is really not in line with our values but we appreciate you bringing attention to the case.” I figured that was fine enough and they’re the the family.

I took the song around to several radio stations and created a YouTube channel and really didn’t get any play out of it which is fine, if people don’t like it they don’t like it. 

Well for one reason or another my YouTube channel got a little bit a buzz recently and it’s been extremely negative and people are really making fun of me. In fact so much so that a lot of times I go out in town people will quote lyrics from the song to me and it basically makes fun of me. Well this buzz also got the attention of her family again and they sent an incredibly nasty email tell me telling me to drop it that they warned me once they werent appreciative of the song and if I kept it up, they are going to have to “take action.” I responded to the email and said I was sorry and I was just trying to bring attention to the case and this particular family member just replied with “you’re a fucking creep, let it go.”

1,"AITA for making my fiancé pay for a hotel herself because she refuses to stay with my parents on Christmas? | So this Christmas the plan is for my fiancé and I to fly out and visit my parents. We’ve done this before and we stayed at their house, which I thought was fine. This year she wants to get a hotel for two nights instead of staying with them. I asked why and she complained that there’s no privacy at my parents’ (Which is true - we won’t be the only guests there. But it’s literally two nights!). 

Aside from that I’m already going to have to deal with my mother’s hurt feelings over this since I don’t see my parents all that often anymore. Mostly everyone in my family has a strong personality so I get why my fiancé feels somewhat smothered. But again, it’s two freaking nights. 

Anyway I told her that I’m not spending money on a hotel room and that I’m staying with my parents. She got mad and accused me of abandoning her on Christmas and acting like a child. Finally I said if she wants me to go to the hotel with her then she’s footing the whole bill. She gets mad and starts going off about how much money she’s spending on the wedding and I should be willing to pay something. (To be clear - *she* isn’t paying for anything. Her parents want this huge elaborate wedding that no one can afford and they’re paying for most of it, which they never complained about. Meanwhile, I’m trying to save so we can finally buy a house). 

Anyway it turned into this huge fight and she thinks I’m being selfish. I really am tempted to just tell her to go spend the holiday with her own family and I’ll see her afterward. But I feel like she’d actually kill me so I haven’t said that.

0,"AITA for piercing my sister's baby's ears? | I (f) own a piercing and tattoo studio and take pride in doing things properly. For those of you who don't know, piercing guns are generally very very bad. Although most people say ""I had mine done with a gun and they are fine"", it's still a poor way of piercing as a gun forces the jewellery through the lobe causing trauma to the skin, meaning that, if you decide not to have the piercing anymore, the holes are less likely to heal and the scars will be more thick and visible. Also, you cannot properly sterilise a piercing gun, and they break/get stuck often. It's also easier to pierce with needles as you can be 100% sure of where the hole is going to go. Because of this, I always pierce with needles and make sure my staff do too. 

My sister is 18 and has a 5 month old baby girl. I love my sister and my niece to death but my sister was insisting on piercing her daughter's ears, and assumed I would do it. In my studio, we don't pierce babies because of the chances of the piercings being uneven when they grow up, and simply because as the owner I don't think it's fair to pierce someone who cannot give their consent to the procedure. There's also the added issues of babies not knowing it's bad to play with new piercings, the risk of them falling asleep on the piercing and hurting it, and I've also heard of parents not cleaning the piercings properly because they're ""worried about hurting the baby"". I told my sister, when she asked when she could bring my niece in, that I would not do it. 

She said that if I don't, she'll go to Claire's and get them done there. I thought she was just trying to goad me into doing it to be honest, so I rolled my eyes and that was it (we've had chats before about why piercing at Claire's is bad). The next day she messaged saying she was in the mall and she was serious, and I have ten minutes to say I'll do it.

I ignored her, so she called me, we had a small fight in which she insisted I do it, or Claire's does, so I eventually agreed. 

She brought my niece into my studio, and I pierced her ears. It was actually quite a smooth process but my niece obviously cried. My sister actually paid me, which surprised me, and then she left, happy she got what she wanted. 

I feel awful, and unprofessional. This was a couple of weeks ago and the piercings are healing well.

1,"AITA for putting a $500 doll on our credit card? Wife PISSED |  

Well, this all started about two years ago when I saw something called a Ball-Jointed Doll (BJD) on Tumblr. I was instantly in love. Since then I have obtained 5, ranging in price from $100-250 (not including clothes, wigs, etc). My wife (I'm also a female, btw) has been supportive of my hobby, as far as I knew. 

However, one doll eluded me. My Holy Grail Doll. Limited edition, long discontinued, almost impossible to find. Until last week. I found it for sale for $500. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity. If I \*ever\* find one again, it won't be this good of a price. I had to act fast before someone else bought it. I put it on our emergency credit card. 

When the doll arrived I stupidly didn't hide the invoice and my wife saw how much it cost. She was \*pissed\*. She asked where I got that much money short notice and I told her I used the card. She was \*much more pissed\*. She said I would ruin our credit. I said that I promise I will pay every extra cent I get after bills toward it until it's payed off. No fun purchases, no alcohol, not even any takeout until it's paid. Apparently it will still ruin our credit. But isn't this the exact sort of thing credit is for?

She then dropped the bombshell that now she hates the dolls, thinks they're creepy, and doesn't want them in our bedroom. Until now she liked the dolls just fine and was glad I have a hobby. I have to keep them all in my home office. Which sucks because I liked to keep the dolls close to me while I sleep and cuddle with them at night while we watch TV. She said if I want to sleep near the dolls I can sleep in my office (which is actually a closet, I can't lay down). She wants me to return the doll, but I can't because this is literally a \*once in a lifetime opportunity\* to get this doll. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for getting upset that my friend got pregnant? | I am a 23F who has been with my 24M fiance for a couple of years. We have been on and off, but after some counseling I am able to forgive him for cheating on me. We have been trying to get pregnant though for a whole year now, and I did get pregnant for a while but sadly had a miscarriage. 

I know I struggle to get pregnant due to my size, and I have been trying to work on lowering it. But sometimes its just hard to get out of bed as I feel my depression is holding me down, but anyways.

Just last week, my friend (We'll name her Alex) got pregnant with essentially a friends with benefits. She has only known this guy for maybe a month, and they hit it off pretty quickly, like they started fucking after knowing each other for 3 days.

She came over to my house, took a pregnancy test and just started bawling her eyes out and complaining. But she doesn't seem to understand that I am dealing with issues of my own! I just had a miscarriage just a  couple of months before, and Its still a pretty tender wound for me. 

Shes sitting there crying on the toilet, holding the pregnancy test in her hands and asking me what shes going to do. That is when I got upset and yelled at her, exclaiming that at least she could have babies! I've been struggling for this for a while now!! She has no idea how I feel!

And she looked appalled! She then just left silently to go to another friends house who I don't get along with. We'll call her Mary. I don't get along with Mary because she's never there for me.

Mary had the gall to tell me I was TA because ""I only cared about my feeling or my complaints but when someone else has a complaint, I always make it about myself."" WHAT?? I told her to fuck off and she hung up! I don't make it about myself??? Alex just doesn't realize the pain I've been going through.

S has known E since middle school, and I've known E for about as long as I've known S (7 years). Shes been a very amazing friend to us and we are beyond heartbroken that shes gone. Sometimes I wake up wondering if any of this is real. Ever since her death I've been isolating myself (apart from work obviously). I've been a bit avoidant when it comes to talking (not inviting S over as much) but literally everything reminds me of E and it's taking over me at this point. But on the other hand, S... literally seems like she doesn't care at ALL about E. I've tried speaking to her about it because i THOUGHT it was hard on us both, but she literally pretends as if E doesn't exist and literally ignores me when I bring her up. And all shes been doing is partying and whoring herself (and I suspect she may be doing drugs AND drinking) until this March according to her lack of party posting on social mefia, and I find it incredibly disturbing. She was closer to E than she was to me, so I don't understand why shes behaving this way. She moved on so quickly (I never saw her cry, or even discuss her ever since she died), even though it's literally been just TWO months. Anyways, over the few times shes came to my house after E died, everytime she comes she criticizes me about my behavior and says I ""need to lighten up a little"". I've lightly reminded her not to do this, because I'm very clearly grieving, but she hasn't respected me. Yesterday, I invited her over hoping this repetitive cycle would stop, but I finally broke when literally all I did was SIGH and she went off about how I need to stop acting like this and that I'm becoming a turtle, always hiding in my shell. At this I promptly told her I had enough of her shit and yelled at her until she left, calling her an inconsiderate shit for not even caring about poor E. I talked to my mom over the phone today and my mom told me that in times like this, loved ones should be helping eachother, and that all I'm doing is shutting people out of my life over ""minor comments"".

0,"AITA for breaking the 'pay it forward chain' at the Dunkin Donuts near my house |  A little background info on the pay it forward chain is when the customer in front of you in a drive thru pays for your order, the expectation is that you would pay for the person behind you and continue the chain. These are very common where I live and some have even lasted long enough to get news coverage. This was one of those chains because of how busy this particular location was. 

 I normally dont buy coffee, but I was out of creamer and figured I would grab one on my way to go grocery shopping. It's around 7:30 am so it is understandably busy, there are several cars in front of me and behind me in the drive thru, a mini-van full of people is directly behind me. I order a medium coffee and proceed to the window. The woman at the window who is decked out in christmas accessories including reindeer antlers says excitedly that the person ahead of me had paid for my coffee and if I would like to pay for the people behind me. I look at the amount of their order which is shown on the base of the window to be $18.24. Had it been amount closer to the $2.50 I would have been paying for my coffee I would have simply paid it, but almost $20 was too much. I declined and took my coffee and the woman gave me a scornful look and said in a tone I could only associate with disappointment ""Have a nice day."" 

I did not think too much of this situation until I discussed it with a friend later today. She said that I should have just paid it because it was Christmas and it's the season of giving and I was being a ""Grinch"".

We have to make weekly assignments which will count to your final mark. These assignments are graded on your outcome, and whether you follow the style of the uni (4 spaces etc). These assignments have to be made in pairs.

So i paired up with someone, and during the first assignment i got the problem to work, and he immidiately started to complain that it could be more efficient. Now enter 2-3 hours of more coding because our code had to be more efficient. (Efficiency is NOT in the rubric and wont be taken into account).

Enter week 2, we went through this more smoothly, but this week we got the results and we made a small mistake, no biggy, we have an 8.5/10. He now wants to talk to the professor, and send emails (while our code just doesnt work). I said no and got kind of annoyed, people have better things to do you know.

Enter week 4, we have to make something which prints the output of our program, im done after 15 mins (for which he was still reading the assignment and talking on facebook) and he looks at my code and says, ""it can be more efficient"". I say okay sure, but it works and we are not graded on efficiency. Anyways i give him 15 mins (i wanted to take a short break anyways) where he makes code  on my laptop. After 15 minutes his code is still a mess which wont work, and i want to continue with the difficult part of the assignment. So i tell him we should take my code and just continue. He says no, so i get annoyed since he is using my laptop, i woulnt mind him doing it on his laptop while i continue. So i tell him that im going to use my code, and send his code to him. I will admit this was in a bitchy tone aftet going back and forth for 5 minutes. After that he spend 4 hours sitting doing something on his code (which still isnt finished after 4 hours) and he was also using facebook. He wont talk properly to me even when i engage with him, to ask how he is doing with his thing. 

Just before he leaves i tell him he can finish the last bit of code 1/4 of the project. He says yes and leaves.

Since then he has ghosted me on whatsapp.

0,"AITA for giving my daughter a Xanax? | Gonna try to keep this short and sweet. My daughter is 20 years old and has a severe panic disorder. She recently (6 weeks ago) lost her job, which means she lost her health insurance, and she moved back home to get back on her feet.

My daughter was prescribed Xanax but can no longer afford the doctor’s visits or prescription costs. My wife and I are also struggling financially and can‘t afford to pay for her either. I also take Xanax for the same disorder, but don’t take them often, so I have a decent amount sitting around in case of an emergency. 

Yesterday morning my daughter had a horrible panic attack. It got to the point where her mother wanted to take her to the ER. However having been in the same situation I knew 1) the ER would just sedate her and keep her for observation and 2) we can’t afford it.

So instead I gave my daughter one of my Xanax. 30 minutes later my daughter is fine and takes a nap.

My wife is pissed with me. She’s always been against medications/therapy and I had to fight tooth and nail to get myself and my daughter treatment. She says what I did was illegal (technically true) and fucked up. My argument is that my daughter takes the exact same medication and dosage, just can’t afford it. And the ER was gonna do the same damn thing!

1,"WIBTA for refusing to pay for a dog if the owner picks I name I don’t like | Ok so basically my sister has had a rough time the past couple of years due to mental health issues and our parents getting divorced. We had a discussion about a “goal” to look forward to when she got out of hospital and it was decided she could finally have her own dog. We found a breeder of her favourite dog breed and the puppy is due to be ready mid April. I said I would pay for the dog as a birthday present as my mother has had to use a lot of her savings on medical expenses and I have a well paying job and still live at home so don’t pay as much rent as I would do if I was on my own. The total cost of the puppy is £1,500 because it’s a very small, desirable dog. 
The issue is we were discussing names and when she made her list of names she liked I liked all of them apart from one name which isn’t even a name anybody has ever used for a dog and sounds stupid. This is the name she has decided she wants to call the dog. I said to her I don’t like the name and since I will end up walking it because I work from home a lot I don’t feel comfortable calling out the name because it’s stupid. She said it’s nothing to do with me what she calls it because it’s her dog, I said I know it’s her dog but I should have a say because I’m paying for it and I don’t see why she can’t just pick another name from the list that we both liked. She says it’s her dog and that’s the end of it. I said if it’s her dog and she’s the only one who has any input she can pay for the dog because I’m not paying that amount of money for a dog with a ridiculous name",False,False
1,"AITA if I make my sister take out loans based on my mom’s wishes? | I (34M) have been raising my sister (17F) for the past 7 years. Our mom passed away and had her via sperm donor, so I got custody. Our mother was a pretty wealthy person, with expectations for both of us. While we both have trust funds and college funds set up, our mom didn’t want us going to college for anything “frivolous” in her mind. She didn’t require me to go after a certain degree but said she wouldn’t pay for my college if it was pursued through the arts. I never wanted to get such a degree and ended up going into engineering. Before she died, she told me that she had put aside money for my sister’s education and that I could use it towards that, as long as she didn’t study the arts.


My sister is graduating this year and she’s been accepted into several colleges. Now, I’ve always known that my sister is artistically talented. She loves drawing and painting. When we last spoke, she wanted to get an architecture degree, which I felt fit her other talents as well. Then I found out she had applied to two universities’ art programs and she really wants to go. She would like to one day be an animator or storybook illustrator. The thing is, her college fund could pay for one of these universities but I know that it wasn’t what our mother had in mind. I told her that and said that I promised our mother I’d never use the money for that and if she wanted to major in it, she’d be on her own. My sister says that’s unfair because she’d be able to get no aid since I make too much (probably true) and she doesn’t want to be in debt.

I spoke with our grandmother and she thinks I’m being a nitpicky asshole. Yet my grandfather thinks I should stick to what my mother wants. The issue is she didn’t put it in writing. So, I could do with it what I wanted. AITA here if I don’t pay for my sister’s tuition?",False,False
1,"AITA for expecting financial assistance from my parents? | Sorry yall, this'll be a long one.

My brother is now 33 and i'm 29. We both suffer from severe mental illnesses. 

My brother is previously divorced, and is now remarried with 3 kids. My brother does not work and has been applying for disability for about 2 years now. My parents helped my brother through his divorce to ensured he got full custody of their grandson. He's lived with them for most of his life and they are VERY attached to his kids, and have taken a huge part in raising them.  They purchased all christmas gifts for the grandkids for 10 years. They paid for the kid's activities.  He recently moved his whole family across the country after several conflicts with them, breaking my parent's hearts. 

Now on to me. I have been separated from an abusive husband for more then 3 years now. I have chosen to put kids off until I am both financially and mentally stable.  I tried to do the divorce entirely on my own, but couldn't complete it.  I'm now waiting until I have the resources to hire a lawyer.  My parents have not assisted me in this process.

In the past 3 years, I have worked very hard on myself. I pay for therapy out of pocket as I have no insurance. I searched for a local center who does free psychiatrist appointments about a year ago and I have attended monthly appointments ever since.  I take my meds. My doctors have advised I only work part time, bringing me to the realization that i'm going to have to do school to get anywhere in life. I worked really hard, got my associate's at a local community college and got into a university.  I recently quit my part time job at the urging of my doctors because I am starting at the university full time and they don't think I could stay healthy doing both.  

So financial aid is the only thing getting me by, along with a TON of help from my incredibly supportive boyfriend who works his ass off 60 hours a week. His mother also helps us absolutely anytime we need it, no questions asked. I hate taking money from her.  It hurts a bit knowing that she would help us and my parents wouldn't.  

My parents guilt me every time I ask for money, saying they have none to give. If I ask for 30 bucks, there is the full expectation that I'd be paying it back in the next 2 weeks. If I can't pay it yet, I will recieve frequent calls and texts expecting it back until I give it to them.  They've loaned me larger amounts (250 a little over a month ago for car insurance and groceries) and they call me constantly about it even though they know I have no income right now. 

Now they're doing their signature move,  saying they can't loan us any more money but we can move in with them. When I express that A. As a mentally ill person, the instability of moving is the last thing I need right now,  and B. It is inappropriate to live with your parents at 29 if it can be avoided in any way. They cry saying, I ""don't want to live with them"",  because they're ""so horrible."" 

For years I have been the one that my mother or father would go to if they needed something from someone they could depend on. I listen to them endlessly bitch about my brother. I have unfortunately taken on the role of their emotional caretaker, even though I tell them continually to talk to a therapist instead.  Now i'm starting to wonder why I stress about supporting them emotionally so much when they leave me to fend for myself all the time financially. I feel like as I get healthier through therapy,  I get more and more mad at them about this bullshit. 

Now I see them sending my brother's kids a mountain of christmas presents, and they are preparing to move into a house that is more expensive then their current one. They just bought a new car this year. I truly feel like if I had a kid id have a much higher value to them and that sucks. Am I a dick for feeling like I deserve some level of assistance from them? Am I the asshole? ",False,False
1,"WIBTA for getting my sister a horrible job just to prove a point? | My (21f) sister (18f) is looking for a job at the moment, it would be her first job. She cannot drive, so she’s looking for a job within her area.

A friend of mine posted about his job in the area that’s looking for a dishwasher (it’s a minimum wage, part time, food service job). My friend told me the job would be horrible for her but that they’d be immediately hiring.

My sister never does chores, much less dishes. I wouldn’t either when I lived at home, but I did them more than her. She would constantly give me shit for being lazy and never doing chores, even though she not only didn’t do any but made more of a mess than I did.

I told her recently (after I’ve been doing minwage jobs since I was 17) that I don’t think she would be able to handle getting a minwage job because of all the cleaning. I told her this coming from a place of “it was hard for me, it’ll be hard for you, here’s a warning” but she got incredibly defensive and turned it onto me being lazy and how she’s nothing like that.

I’m planning on telling her about this job that she’d probably get, but not about how hard the job would be. I’m partially doing it to help out, but I’ll admit part of it is also spite/having her eat her words. WIBTA?",False,False
1,"AITA for speaking during a movie trailer? | The other day I went to the movies with a friend. The theatre room was a pretty small one and there were few people there. 

Usually the first 20 minutes are just trailers and advertising, so I was talking with my friend, as were other people, before the movie started. I hadn’t seen her in months so I was updating her on my life, and so was she. It’s important to mention that we weren’t speaking loudly, we were talking at a normal and reasonable volume. 

All of a sudden, this lady behind us puts her head between our seats and asks us in a polite but assertive way “could you please stop talking? I can’t concentrate”. My friend and I comply as we didn’t want to make a big scene, but the point is we were talking during a movie trailer and this lady basically wanted to focus on something that she can rewatch for free on YouTube. 

I understand that people have the right to enjoy the trailers, but common courtesy (at least in my country) is to keep quiet during the movie - which I always do - not the ads part, and honestly what is there to focus on during a trailer? Anyway, this has never happened to me before.

1,"AITA for being unsympathetic to my aunt about her Parent Plus loan? | I was at lunch with some family a few weeks ago, including my aunt. Her daughter wasn't there but people asked how she was. My aunt was upset about how she still hadn't got a job yet that she can afford the full monthly payments on ""her"" student loan which my aunt admitted was a Parent Plus loan so ""she's stuck paying it"". My cousin graduated a year ago so payments began late 2018.

I've worked at a university so I'm familiar with these loans. Frankly they suck and my aunt is an idiot for taking one out expecting her daughter to pay it. That's something no one should EVER do. Parent Plus loans are loans in the parent's name the student has ZERO legal obligation to pay. This is stated in the forms she had to sign to take them out. Furthermore they have higher interest rates than standard student loans and accrue interest while the student is in school, unlike some loans in the student's name. My parents and I went over this while I was in college. Most of the loans were taken out by myself and I'm still paying them. My mother took out a much smaller amount in Parent Plus loans. She has repaid them. She never once asked me to do so.

Furthermore if my cousin had taken out Stafford loans in her name she would be eligible to get the payments reduced based on her current income. Parent Plus loans do not have this option, even based on the parent's income. It sounds like my aunt took out the loan instead of having my cousin do it because that was more ""responsible"" than having an 18 year old do it. This is bullshit and if she had talked to anyone in financial aid at the university or her sister (my mother) who had experience with this she'd have learned this instead of taking out $30k+ on some uneducated assumptions.

So frankly hearing this kind of annoyed me. I told her I was sorry her daughter hadn't found a very good job yet but the loan isn't her daughter's, it's hers and the daughter has ZERO legal obligation to pay it, and this was all stated in the form she signed taking out the loan and if she didn't want for this to happen she should've just had her daughter take out most of the loans as I did and that I hoped this was a learning experience for anyone there who had kids not in college yet. She got very cold to me, and some of the other people kind of gave me a cold stare too and seemed upset.

Am I out of line? I get how frustrating the situation is, but it could've been easily avoided doing basic research about this stuff that anyone should do, and that my parents did themselves and avoided all this. This isn't even an issue caused by circumstances out of her control.",False,False
1,"AITA for refusing to pay my sister for “her time” fixing a desk that she owns? | My sister has an old wood desk that she picked up at the dump and did work refinishing. It does look pretty nice now and she did a good job, but it’s not a professional job. Anyway I was doing a project on it and, when I finished, realized that knife I used went through and left a scratch on the top of the desk. I was really apologetic and I told her that I’d fix it, she said she didn’t want me to do it and she’d do it. I offered her some money for supplies. She shot back that she wanted $100. The supplies to fix the desk couldn’t possibly be $100 so I asked why so much money, she said she wanted money for the time she’d have to put in fixing the desk. I mean, I think this is really ridiculous—I have to pay her, a non-professional, money to fix a desk that SHE owns? I said basically as such and she said “okay well I’ll bring it to a professional refinisher and you can pay for that” and I said I didn’t want to pay for someone to fix the desk up better than it was before. This was all in a huge fight going all around the house, she was calling me a moron for scratching it and I called her a moron basically for being so upset, since the desk already has issues and she got it for free at the dump.

I think I’m being reasonable in offering to pay for supplies, actually pretty generous considering she already has them so I’d be giving her money for stuff she already has, but everyone around me is acting like I pissed in her cereal. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for putting down our family cat without talking to my daughter first | 
My daughter when she was 5 years old brought home a stray cat from her friends house in the neighborhood. Her friends mom put it in a little cat carrier and my daughter lugged it from her house to ours, which was only across the cul-da-sac but still a good haul for my 5 year old to carry. Anyway, we kept the cat, named her Booberry because that was my daughters favorite cereal and she became a loved family pet.

My daughter is now 19 years old which means Boo is a grandma, at about 15. My daughter decided to go off abroad to college, going to Australia while we live in America. 

Boo started showing signs of her age, being slow, lethargic and laying around. I took her to the vet and the vet said her kidneys were failing and we should probably put her down. I was devastated and tried to call my daughter, no answer, call again, no answer. I decided to leave a voicemail telling her about it since I wanted her to know.

We said our goodbyes to Booberry, and pet her until she slipped away. 

About 3 hours later my daughter calls me screaming about how dare I kill her cat without her permission, how I was an evil animal abuser witch and she wishes she had brought Boo with her because then she’d still be alive.

She also said I should have waited until she got home in a few weeks for thanksgiving so she could say goodbye, and now I feel like I should have just waited to tell her until I could get her on the phone.

He stayed with us a little while and has been couch surfing with friends and family ever since. 

After working for 25 years, we bought a vacation home about a year ago with our joint savings (I contributed more but we both work) . Without  consulting me, my wife told her brother that we were buying a vacation home and he could stay there when we weren’t using it. I was pissed when I found that out because I felt like it wouldn’t be a vacation home if he was staying there full time. I wouldn’t be able to go there and relax because it would become “his place”.

Now I have a box of about 20 lipsticks... and last week my mum asked me to borrow a lipstick, not a big thing right? Except she took my favourite one that I wear daily going to work, I sometimes wear going out and its my boyfriends favourite lipstick on me, so I pretty much wear this one every day and I didn’t say anything when she picked that one cos i figured she was only going to borrow it for the night out. 

I waited to see if she would offer it back or return it and she hasn’t, I kinda forgot about it until today. This morning I made us a cup of tea before she goes to work and take the cups into her bedroom. I see my lipstick hanging out her make up bag and take it back and sit down on the sofa with my tea. 

My mum comes in and sees the lipstick on my lap and this is how the conversation goes - making me feel like a right AH...

Mum: oh you’re taking it back are you?

Me: well yeah, it’s my lipstick

Mum: can I not just keep this one?

Me: not really mum, it’s my favourite lipstick

Mum: *starts laughing* no it’s not, you didn’t even know it was in that box until I pulled it out.

(For context, this happened once - she borrowed an eyeliner I had been looking for and didn’t realise it was in the box til she took it out) 

Me: What? Even if that was true that doesn’t mean you can just assume you can keep it, I wear that lipstick every day and it’s Zaks (my boyfriend) favourite one on me *sips tea*

She continues to laugh then goes on to asking me to tell her where I got it from so that she can get one etc when I remembered that I got it from Superdrug or whatever for cheap cos they were no longer selling that brand. 

So I thought I could find it online for her and she walks back into the room whilst I’m looking online and I said something along the lines of “I can’t find the exact one and-“ she cut me off laughing and says “wow this is really bothering you isn’t it, it’s a lipstick!” which just annoyed me even more, cos it doesn’t matter if it’s something as small as that. I just responded “yeah, actually it is - cos you can’t seem to grasp the concept that just because I’m your daughter, everything I buy isn’t automatically yours” which may have seemed a bit harsh but this has happened more than once.

1,"AITA For Phone Etiquette | Ok, so this is something that happened a month ago that’s been driving me crazy that recently was jogged back into my brain.

I (38m) have a coworker/friend (40m) that I talk to on a regular basis, but the vast majority of our communication lately is via text, as we both have personal lives and family that consumes a lot of our time. We don’t work in the same exact area, but do see each other for meetings and events, and go out to lunch when we get an opportunity.

A lot of our conversations we have are centered around work, and since we share a lot of the same management and coworkers that work between departments (plus he used to work in my department, coworkers are the focus of some of these conversations. 

Now, I’m not super gossipy or anything, but we do talk about who isn’t competent or productive, or who is being a problem at work, what we don’t like about our managers, etc...

Here’s where the problem comes in. We had a huge work event, and at this event, my friend loses his phone. He seems fairly indifferent, until it comes up that he has NO SCREEN LOCK.

I proceeded to tear into him about not locking his phone. He tells me that he’s not concerned with other people reading his stuff, but all my conversations with him are on it, all his friends, his family, and probably other coworkers. My phone number is in his phone, social media contacts, possibly address, all in his phone.

I feel like in an era of text heavy communication and online information people have an obligation to lock their phone to protect not only themselves, but the people they talk to. Now I have no idea who is digging through his phone and what information they have or what conversations they have read through/shared with other people.

I had planned to move out then. It's a 3 bedroom and I live with two girls - 1 is great, the other is awful. We just don't function well as roommates, she's very unclean, leaves her stuff out, doesn't do chores, eats my food, drinks my alcohol, and allows her boyfriends dog to come over frequently (which is a direct violation of our lease).

We've spoken about dividing chores, cleaning up, etc but to no avail. Wednesday was the final straw - she started screaming at me about my issues with the dog who peed on my couch in the living room (yes, it's a shared space, but I asked that the dog wasn't allowed up there). It then turned into her threatening me, calling me just ridiculous names, and overall immaturity. I did not say anything back, and just let her get it out.

0,"AITA for telling a lady that the dog park isn’t a petting zoo | I’ve lurked on this sub for so long and now I have something to post finally, not as dramatic as some others but I’d still like some feedback. 

I have a very small dog, she’s a rescued tea cup chihuahua who along with some birth defects due to her unfortunate family tree, is also very fearful of children, as a lot of tiny dogs tend to be. Because of this, she can come off as aggressive when kids get too close. It’s not usually a problem, and parents usually understand when I explain why their kid can’t play with my dog. 

My dog is okay with other dogs, of all sizes. She grew up with labs so she knows how to handle herself, regardless when she’s at the dog park I NEVER take my eyes of her. The dog park we go to is great for her because it’s big enough to where she can run around with bigger dogs but still has enough room to keep her distance and move away if she needs to. There’s also a fenced off small dog area, but we rarely use it as there’s usually no one in there. 

We’ve been going to this dog park for years, with no issues. Recently a lady came in with her two daughters, about 5 and maybe 3. I didn’t mind her at first, she said she was new to the neighborhood and her girls just wanted to meet the dogs. When they approached mine, I explained to the kids that they couldn’t play with my dog. The problem is it’s been about a month now, and almost every single time I’ve been there’s, she’s there too. I have to explain to her kids every time that they can’t touch my dog, sometimes multiple times. 

Eventually I talked to the mom about it, she gave me a weird look and said “look, they’re all fine playing together, it’s good for your dog to learn to be around kids anyway.” I briefly explained to her that that’s not how that works, but rather than make it an issue, I took my dog home. The last straw was the last time I was at the dog park, the older girl hopped the fence and fell right on top of another smaller dog, which to their credit they did apologize to the owner for. Not 5 minutes later I see the two girls corner and taunt my dog, who’s growling and barking at them, clearly terrified. The mom sees this too, and rushes over telling me to calm my dog down, and that if my dogs aggressive I should keep it in the fenced area (even though that area is for small dogs, not aggressive ones, who would even bring an aggressive dog to a dog park). 

I snapped, does she have fucking brain damage? Some sort of short term memory loss? I had already told her AND her kids to leave my dog alone. So I let her know all of this, and ended it by reminding her that the dog park isn’t a petting zoo, it’s specifically so that dogs can play freely. If the kids are preventing even one dog from doing so, they shouldn’t be there. There’s plenty of other, probably safer places for her to take her kids.

So what I ended up doing was sending a group text with audio, video, and text interactions with her from when we dated that I'd been documenting in case things turned physical and I needed to call the cops (thankfully never did). Since then things have blown up. I've suffered tremendous reputation damage, but she took an even bigger hit.

My closer friends throughout this ordeal stuck by me but I probably could've kept them regardless of whether or not i sent that group text. As far as I know everyone in the friend group is disgusted by her. She hasn't contacted me.

Since I didn't get anything from this except that I felt a lot better (like I got a lot of emotional baggage off my chest), thought I can't shake off the feeling that I was wondering if I'm the asshole here.

Whatever the verdict, I'm going to defend my actions in the sense that they made *me* feel a lot better, however.",False,False
0,"AITA for sending a screamer to a woman who sent me a virus link? | Tldr is basically title

I’d like to start by saying this was a number of years ago, but it still bothers me. 

I used to go on Skype fairly often, and one night I got a message from a woman telling me she found my name in a random Skype search. We had a normal conversation for a while before she started gearing the conversation towards her being a cam girl. Once it reached this point I’d thought she was a bot, but our previous conversations were not bot-like at all. 

She told me a story that her supposed “friend” got her into the business and she’d like me, a random kid on the internet, to watch her. I didn’t want to but she sent me a link to her “cam girl” site, but of course as you know this was really just an obvious virus link. 

I didn’t open it, but I gave her a request to “get off” on this certain “video” I like, and so I sent her a website link that’s a screamer. I got blocked immediately after, so I assume it was opened. 

At first I thought it was funny, so I told a certain friend of mine about it, who did not find it funny at all. She went off and told me I was a sh*tty person, even if the woman WAS a bot that my actions were still unacceptable. Ever since I’ve really wanted to know, am I the asshole?",False,False
1,"AITA For Raising My Voice At My Mom For The Way She Thinks Of Me? | When I was a lot younger, I had a great relationship with my mom, but the relationship has dwindled in recent years for many reasons (mainly me becoming a typical teenage boy). I feel our unsteady relationship and how she has to tell me multiple times to do something (like a teen and their mother do) is what affects her opinion of me.

This all started when we were driving home from the store, I like interesting facts and I read aloud a post from subreddit r/TodayILearned. The post said about a folklore tale explains autism by saying something along the lines of like the infant is switched out for the child of a fairy or demon which explains the child's mood or lack of social interaction. My nephew (her grandson) has autism, but I didn't make this connection in my mind because I knew how fucked up that would be. And then she says, ""You better not tell Emily [my sister] about that."" I love my mom, but some of the things she does can really piss me and my dad off, but this pushed me over the edge and I lit her up. ""I'm not going to do that. I would never do that. Why in the hell do you think I'd do that!? God damn it, mom! Why do you think I'd ever do such a horrible thing!? I never would and it really pisses me off you'd even get the thought in your mind that I would ever do such a thing!"" The only thing I regret was actually saying it out loud instead gritting my teeth and holding it in as I usually do. She was silent for the rest of the trip home and I was super uncomfortable because I thought I had upset her.

The same thing almost happened today at my graduation party, which she spun into a housewarming party at the last second (another one of those things that piss me off). We just recently moved into a new house and of course we have new neighbors, one are an older couple from Russia. I only know the husband's name is Aleksandr and his wife spends a lot of time at home because she doesn't know English. Well I was joking around with my friends saying I'm trying to learn Russian through video games and I said ""Brosay granatu"" and ""Prikroyte menya"", which translate out to ""Use your grenade"" and ""Cover me"". ""You better not say that to Alek."" I was wanting to call her out for it again, but we had guests and I didn't want to make a scene.

Before you say anything, I don't usually talk back to her like this. My dad taught me to pick my battles and I do; if I always talked back to her, she would have probably kicked me out a LONG time ago. I'm not posting this because I think she's an asshole and I'm in the right, she's my mother at the end of the day and I'll always love her, I've just felt bad for raising my voice at her like that even though I do feel like I had a valid point.

1,"AITA for harshly calling out my single mum for trying to take credit for my achievements? | The basic situation was me and my mum were at a family dinner with aunts we hadn't seen in a while when she decided to start bragging about my wealth/job. Got fed up and told her to stop which clearly provoked her a bit, she then called me ungrateful and lucky for having ""such a good mum"". Truth be told she wasn't truly awful, but provided very little support and said things to me you just shouldn't say to children e.g. calling me a monster, retard etc. Rest of my brothers are working minimum wage, in jail, dead due to ""self termination"" etc and frankly I was probably the most aggressive/violent/prone to depression out of all of them but was lucky to be born very gifted academically so excelled at school despite shit happening at home hence knew I had a future outside of crime/min wage.

&#x200B;

Anyway I lost my temper and openly called her out, saying she did a shit job and the only reasons I'm a doctor/rich is because I was lucky to be born smart, if I wasn't I would most likely be dead or getting arrested constantly . She tried denying it so I pointed out a few things she did, she was crying by this point and played the "" it's hard being a single mum"" card. By this point I was stood up and shouted something along the lines of ""The fuck are you on about, it's your own fault for being a dumb whore and not having an abortion. Fuck you"" and stormed out.

&#x200B;

Got a lot of shit from my family over the phone as my mums apparently ""considering ""self termination"" "" and they never want to see me again.

1,"AITA for only translating for my parents if they let me buy and wear the clothes I want to? | I am 13.  My parents came here from India 14 years ago, and when they came my mom was pregnant with me.  Since that time, they have not managed to improve their English.  My dad speaks very, very basic and broken English, enough to get by in his job as a cashier.  My mom is even worse than him.  She practically knows nothing.  

Ever since I can remember, they have asked me to translate things.  My dad asks for my help with things like bank account stuff and customer service for utilities.  Even the simplest of directions my mom can't seem to handle.  Like bus directions.  

On top of that they are so fucking strict. Like no sleeping over at friend's house.  Or no wearing make up because it is apparently immoral.  Or a bunch of other bullshit rules.

Last month, my mom and I went to a thrift store to buy cheap clothes.  There was this really cute pair of shorts with a nice matching top.  It might have been too short for school, but none of the teachers in our school really give a fuck about the dress code.  It wasn't too expensive and fit within our budget.  My mom didn't allow me to buy it.  She said I was a ""besharam aulaad"" which basically means a shameless asshole child.  She called me immoral and uncultured in our language for wanting to dress naked.  For the record, I would not have been naked.  It was probably revealing, but everyone wears such things. When my dad heard, he said even worse things.

On Friday my mom fell down the stairs.  Luckily, she didn't hit her head, but her foot is injured badly.  I found out about all of this when I came home after taking the subway and saw a note written on the fridge.  

I took the subway to see my parents at the hospital.  When I entered the room, there was a white doctor.  I got up and decided to go outside.  My dad mentioned to me to stay so I could translate.  I told him I would only stay if he allowed me to buy the clothes I want.  He called me an asshole in English (I am surprised he knew that word).

So am I the asshole?",False,False
1,"AITA because I don't believe I should have to clean the whole kitchen when I do dishes? | I moved in with my girlfriend about a year ago, and before then I lived with some roommates. Before then I lived with my mom and dad. When my GF and I moved in we discussed splitting the chores between each other. To be honest I don't see the point in half the chores and feel like since I don't really care if the recycling gets taken out twice a week I shouldn't have to do it. But whatever.

The big argument is that I don't do 'enough' around the house and just do the 'bare minimum' and my GF thinks it's some big, telling problem. For example she cooks, I do the dishes. But apparently I'm supposed to clean down the counters and walls and put stuff back and sweep the floor every time I do dishes. She got mad at me because I wiped around stuff on the counter and just ""pushed the dirt behind the coffee maker"" which yeah so what? 

Then it's like ""You didn't wipe down the stove"" well no, the stove is not ""the dishes"" and who cares if there's a few splashes of food on it? 

Then it's like ""you took the trash out... but not the recycling that was full?"" Yeah because the trash smelled bad and the recycling doesn't. 

Then ""You took the clothes out the dryer but didn't fold them or put them away?"" Yeah because I can find my clothes when I want to. Its her that has to color coordinate and put stuff away and hang it up.

This is becoming a bigger and bigger issue and I feel like I'm constantly being told the way I do things is wrong, the way she does it is right, etc etc. I think it matters more that I constantly feel like shit because these expectations are ridiculous. I'm 32 and I can't just put my clothes in a pile on the dresser because my girlfriend will get mad at me. Wtf.

Anyway this past weekend we got into a big fight about it and she told me that I needed to grow up and learn how to clean up after myself and that she's tired of living like she's in a slob house. I told her that it's not my fault she's up her own ass about keeping things ""clean"" and orderly.

1,"AITA for telling my roommate to shut the fuck up? | So my roommate (close friend ever since we were kids) keeps skipping courses because ""he can't sleep at night"". This is absolutely fine by me since i don't really care, i skip class as well sometimes. 

What bothered me last couple days is that he kept saying we'd go together the next morning (we're in the same class) but every time he doesn't want to get up because he ""couldn't sleep last night."" This has caused me to lose the bus a couple times because i kept waiting for him. 

Additionally, he sleeps every day till 6pm to make up for the lost sleep. 

Here's the thing. The very few hours he is in the kitchen, he always eats at least a pack of chocolate alone. 

I told him that maybe his sleep schedule is fucked because of the massive sugar intake he has. (He literally goes to the store every single day to get 3 packets of chocolate that last him maybe 2 days)

His response? ""No it's not.""
I told him that it does happen to people and he should really stop eating so much sugar and maybe he can sleep.
His response? ""I don't care""

So the last straw was this morning when i also had a very shitty night and decided to skip the first course. He comes out and complains (as usual) about how bad he slept and that it's ""becoming an issue"".

I finally snapped and told him ""shut the fuck up if you value your precious sweets more than your sleep""

He just puffed at me, told me i'm an asshole and opened another chocolate just to piss me off.

1,"AITA for telling my manager that my coworker was high when she got injured at work? | 
I work in a cafe. We serve bagels and coffee in the mornings, and we are usually slammed from 6am to 9am. My coworker and I are the only people at the counter, so she slices and toasts people’s bagels, and I would get their coffees, and take their orders. We normally have a pretty good system. Recently our baker has been making the bagels very soft, and they have been getting stuck in the slicer. We have a pusher to deal with this, but most of my coworkers and even my manager, just pushes more bagels through (and it pushes the stuck ones out).

On Wednesday we had an accident with the slicer. My coworker reached too far in and sliced the top of her finger. It was barely holding on. She had to go to the hospital, and the slicer had to be taken apart and disinfected. All of my coworkers were buzzing about the accident. I hung out at the counter with the manager, who was pissed about having to take the slicer apart, and having to report the injury.

I have seen several of my coworkers smoke joints together in the morning before coming into work. I think that this is extremely unprofessional, but I’ve never made any comments about it. I keep to myself. This time felt different, so I let my manager know that she and several other workers smoke before shifts. It could be why she got hurt. My manager noted this, and I guess she indicated it in the injury report.

Turns out that coworker may not be eligible for workman’s comp because of this, and may have to foot the bill for the reattachment of her finger. I don’t know if someone overheard me talking about it, but someone told my coworker that I “snitched” on her. I overheard a other coworker call me a snitch and an asshole. People are definitely giving me the cold shoulder. I feel isolated. I feel as if I was just being honest, but I’m unsure. Am I an asshole in this situation Reddit?",False,False

We never celebrated Christmas formally, but I just wanted to give her something nice for Christmas given that we’ve been together for 3 years. We are also in a pretty stable relationship.

So she just told me she didn’t get me a Christmas present. I told her I didn’t need one, repetitively, but thought she would at least get me something nice secretively, though I am not expecting anything expensive. Well, she didn’t.

I have an aversion to blood, so naturally I am disgusted by periods as well. I know they're natural, but so are other bodily functions that people find gross. So I tried to tell her this, and just asked if she could let me know when she is on her period so we could avoid each other. I knew that since I was the one asking most of the onus is on me, so I volunteered to take the couch while she is on her period, I just need to know when it is.

She was very upset and said I need to ""grow up"". I said that having an aversion to blood has nothing to do with needing to grow up, and I'm willing to accommodate the situation and give her the room to herself so she should be happy about it.

0,"AITA for confronting my child's father's wife on FB? | Quick background, my ex/child’s father (referred to as Fred) was in my life from 2006-2010. We dated and had our son in 2009, breaking up the next year. He was still very active in his life and he saw him every weekend. We had a decent co-parenting relationship. In 2011 he met his now wife and they were pregnant very quickly with their first child. Around 2013 we stopped hearing from them completely, I moved two hours away for work (we live in a very rural state and the town we all lived in had zero job opportunities). I offered different ways for him to remain involved but communication on his end ceased completely after the move. I no longer send updates as he never responded to any for years. He continues to pay child support via paycheck deductions but he has made zero effort to see my son in nearly seven years.

 

Two weeks ago, his wife friend requested me on Facebook. I noticed that they have since had three more children since our last contact and that they still live in the same town two hours away. She is very much the small town American social media obsessed type mom. Yesterday she posted something about her complete family as it was some anniversary, she has all girls with my ex and her child from a previous relationship was also a girl. Her status mentioned how “no boys are necessary to complete our famILY*"" and my heart broke for my son. There were lots of comments about how happy this family is and how “perfect” they all are. How great of a person she and Fred are.  She responded to a comment about how hard it must be for Fred to have all girls that “he wouldn’t have it any other way! he is the best daddy ever!”

 

I got very angry. I left the following comment: “Did everyone forget about Fred’s son? The one that he all but abandoned seven years ago because his son moved two hours away? The son he never responds to texts/emails about? The son that he has his name tattooed on his arm for the world to see? The son that asks about his sister (apparently sisters now) and Fred regularly? Let’s not pretend that this man is some amazing father, he is a deadbeat.”

There were a lot of confused comments and even people who had no idea Fred had a son. Eventually she deleted my comment. 

 

She messaged me and tore me apart before blocking me completely. In her message she told me that her and Fred are not responsible for the fact that I moved two hours away and that’s just very far for them so it was hard to make it work. They both were and are gainfully employed with cars and licenses.

1,"AITA for getting into an argument with my gf’s mom? | So my girlfriend of 2 years has invited her mom and 15yo brother to spend Christmas together (this was last year). We live in a different country, so she thought it’s be nice to celebrate festive season all together as she doesn’t see the family very often.

My gf didn’t really consult this with me, and bought the flight tickets for her mom and brother for one week at ours. This was kind of annoying considering we live a small studio (but we have room enough for 4). I thought 4 days with the family would have been enough, but not the whole week! Gf explained that the tickets were at reasonable price only for a 7 day period and that getting a hotel in the city is super expensive (which is the case).

When her family came over, my gf was working, so she’s asked me to take them to the city and show them around. I was on holidays at that time, but I was still mad at her, so I declined (I also really needed my own space due to stress at work). Then Christmas came around and my gf and her mom were cooking dinner, also brought me some presents which was nice, but I didn’t want to spend Christmas with her fam, so I left to my office. When I came back, the whole family was watching TV really loud and I felt that that was too much for me, so I turned off the TV. Her mom told me to get back to the office if I kept acting like this.

Next day, gf’s mom came over and told me that I was very impolite and she was mad. I told her that she didn’t value my space, literally doing anything she wanted around the house. She was also mad that I didn’t spend time with them at all over these 7 days, but I mentioned that I’m an introvert and stressed at work, and wanted to spend Christmas with my girlfriend only.

1,"AITA for siding with my boyfriend vs. my family in an argument? | This is so ridiculous to me, but maybe I’m just not getting it.

**background** 
Ever since our very first date, my bf and I have *never* paid for anything for each other. Not even so much as a candy bar at a gas station. We pay for our own stuff. It’s not necessarily how I’ve always done things (I like to spoil my friends, and it’s nice to be treated every once in a while) but my boyfriend is extremely tight with his money, and he’s never made me buy *him* anything, so I’ve honestly just gotten used to it.

My boyfriend is staying with me and my family at my childhood home for the time being. Overall—
It’s been really nice! My parents like him a lot, he’s respectful to them, etc....until money comes in to play.

**what happened**

So my parents are aware that my boyfriend is “stingy” as they call him. I’m aware they’re from a different generation which is why this is a huge red flag to them so I’m trying to be understanding. The other day my boyfriend asks what i want to do for dinner, I said how about pizza delivery? He goes “okay, just Venmo me half.”

My mom calls me into the other room and goes “why don’t you stand up for yourself. He can pay for a f*cking pizza.” I’m like, he doesn’t have to though. He’s paying for his portion. She gets very frustrated and brings up the fact that he’s staying with us, and a “gentleman” would do something in return for his hosts. My boyfriend does things around the house (cleans dishes, even washes the dog) but to her that’s not “ceremonial” enough. I’m like, what’s ceremonial about a pizza??? Is this really about you just wanting him to buy you dinner?

So my boyfriend walks in, evidently has heard at least half of this argument. He goes “To be frank, Mrs. H, while I appreciate you letting me stay with you, I don’t owe your daughter anything. Especially not my money. We’re both adults, and we can pay for ourselves. This is just something we’ve worked out together.”

I took his side, and now my mom is convinced he doesn’t value me, is disrespectful and “doesn’t see the relationship going anywhere” since he “won’t invest”. I told her that she’s being ridiculous and that’s not how my generation handles money. She’s furious at both of us now.

To top it off, she has had alzheimer's for almost two decades, and has been a husk for most of that. Needless to say we haven't really been close. I love my immediate family and my extended family. We are all on good terms. I can't stress that enough.

Now, I have worked for years to graduate. Not just 4 years, more like 7. I fell into a depression early on in college. I flunked out and was homeless for a bit. I got myself together and made a lot of sacrifices to get to where I am today. I had support from my family, and I always made time to support them. I would drive an hour each way to help out if they needed anything. I would go back to take care of my sister if my Dad was out of town and my Mom was at work.

I was halfway done with one of the pieces of the front lawn when my next door neighbor showed up.

This lady (who I'm going to call Barbara) has lived in this neighborhood for about 4 or 5 years. We had never spoken before, I don't know her real name, and I only knew she existed because I had seen her walk her daughter to the elementary school nearby.

Barbara walked up to me, pulled the headphones I was wearing off my head, and just said ""STOP!"" in a rude tone. I turned off the lawnmower and faced her. Barbara said that her daughter was sick and trying to sleep, and the lawnmower was too loud for her to sleep. I didn't believe this because my lawnmower is a push mower, not a big riding mower and that it isn't excessively loud. My dad occasionally mows the lawn and while I can hear it running inside the house, it is easily ignorable.

I decided to give this lady the benefit of the doubt and said that I will finish this one section of yard and do the rest later. Finishing this one section would be only a couple minutes. Barbara said no, and that i needed to stop immediately. I explained how short she would have to wait for me to finish, but she wasn't having any of it. This continued for another minute before I put my headphones back on and started mowing again. She should there for a second, yelling at me,but realizing I wasn't going to talk to her, walked away.

And since that rose my suspicion higher than it's ever been, she had left her phone in the bathroom when I went to take a shower this morning and we are very open and neither one of us get mad if the other needs to use the others phone for texting and calling people. So I locked the door and went through her texts and found that not only had she been texting her friend J for around 5 months as far as I could tell. Not only had she been texting him, she had been texting her best friend E as well and the texts read as if I was Cs ex and we haven't been together for years. Yet I've even met E at a party and was introduced to her as Cs boyfriend. 

So the main question is, AITA for looking at my girlfriend's texts to see she's been cheating and sleeping with her ""friend"" for months and has been telling her best friend the entire time as if I don't exist. 

I really am lost for what to do here. I haven't confronted her about it yet, I've been taking my time processing everything so I don't explode and behave irrationally. I just really don't know how to take the news. 

TL;DR- looked at my girlfriend of 6 years' phone and found out she had been hooking up with some guy from her childhood all summer and acts with her best friend as if I don't exist in her life, yet is as close as ever with me and keeps me involved in family matters and what not.",False,False
0,"AITA for not wanting to join an mlm while at work? | Made this throwaway account for my AITA situations, here’s the first one where I’m genuinely not sure. 

So I work in retail at a convenient store. My customer is a woman who is pretty nice and is letting me know she wants 2 separate tags. I always do polite small talk while working and everything is fine. I ring her up for the first order and she pays, as she starts setting her next orders stuff on the counter, she says, “now I’m sure your wondering why I am buying all of these cute small bags!” Of course in my head I couldn’t care less, but I go with it and say “oh why??” And she starts to explain about how she works with a business selling makeup to her clients, and not only does she send her clients the makeup she orders, but she includes these cute bags and other things. Immediately I’m thinking “oh my gosh, a mlm in the wild, I’ve only ever seen them on Reddit and Facebook.” So I just say something like “oh that’s nice” and she continues, saying stuff about how great they are and how they pay for everything, and she pulls out a credit card the has the younique logo on it and begins to explain “see everything I’m buying is from the money I earned from this company and they even give you a card like this, have you ever heard of younique?” I had kinda had enough of the sell so I said “yes I have, and sorry I’m not interested.”

Well that’s when everything flipped, she got extremely angry and said she wasn’t trying to sell me anything and that she has way too many clients already, and at some point her wallet fell and she started yelling saying I knocked it over and didn’t apologize. She asked if my manager was in and I said no and she tries to read my name tag and tells me I’m so lucky my manager isn’t in. I give her my name and tell her she can call and she says “oh I will, I will, I will!” And leaves.

1,"AITA for letting the Road-rage escalate? | I exited a highway which was late at night, nobody else seen on the road except 1 car, the guy sat in my blind spot while i needed to merge. He slowed down and sped up as i did. Preventing me from moving to the next lane always matching my speed. Until i was running out of road. I noticed a dent in the front left panel which was made in a previous accident or scrape while backing out of a carpark.

I floored it and got in front of him and made some distance between, but the lights turned red ahead. He pulled up beside me and i could see him taunting me out of my peripheral vision. finger up, waving at me. Which i just ignored him.

The lights turn green, i let him go. I go slowly to let him leave my vision.

I forgot about him for a moment until he pulls out from being parked on the side of the road. The 2 lanes merge into 1 not far down and he performs the same actions as before, sitting next to me so i can't merge over. This time i stop, let him go by, pull in behind him and then i overtake him, finger up. By this time I am beginning to get the rage. He attempts to keep up with me. I turned another corner and left him far behind. I reach the next set of lights which have a speed camera on them, i slowed down so he could catch up. They change, i make it through before red, but he didn't, got flashed by the camera. At this point i am laughing. but he is angry and swerving all over the road. I then touch my brakes to flash my red lights to piss him off even further. Slow down and speed up each time he gets close to hitting my car. He actually tried to hit me but lost control and snagged his car on a crossing with a barricade in the middle. His car was stuck, so i turned around, put my finger up at him and left.

1,"AITA for telling my (30m) wife (24f) that buying a new couch is a waste of money | We just bought a house together and we will be able to move in in January. We currently do not have a couch and we plan to get one for the living Room in a couple months.

We were having a conversation about where to put furniture in various rooms and she mentioned that you can get a couch at ikea where all of the pieces are replaceable for ONLY $1000. 

I tell her that new couches are a waste of money and we can get a nice sectional couch on Craig's list for in the thrift store for 100-300$. We have a lot of remodels and upgrades to do and blowing money on a new couch doesnt make sense.

She says that maybe not right away but in a few years that's the kind of couch she wants to aspire to. (some background. My wife had a rough childhood and I grew up up in great white suburbia.) So she starts talking about how her mom would always pull furniture on the side of the road and she slept on a mattress from someones front lawn for 7 years (for the record I'm more than willing to buy a nice new matress)

I sympathize with her but that doesnt mean we need to buy a brand new couch. Furniture is super marked up, it's a total racket and we dont need to be wasting energy and materials (carbon footprint) for new couches when we can get a perfectly good couch already made and ready to use.

So I told her we could be really picky and walk away if it's not as good as it looked online but that we never NEED to buy a nee couch. I plan on going my whole life never buying a new couch from a store. I dont want to do it.

A made my plea very passionately and then she stormed off and is currently in the other room

1,"AITA for expecting my parents to enforce the same rules for my brother and I? | Background info: I'm 16, brother is 19, meaning he is legally an adult (USA). He lives at home and pays no rent. He is not currently enrolled in university/college etc, though he says that he plans to enroll and is also not currently working (I work part-time retail). I'd say I'm the more responsible of the two of us, though I do argue with my parents just as much, and I can be disrespectful, but not any more than he is/was at my age. I'm an A student, don't drink, smoke weed, do edibles, party, or vape (he does/did at my age, was more of an athlete).  

So both my brother and I are into competitive PC gaming. Not the healthiest of hobbies, spare me the lecture, but I've got a health condition that means I haven't been able to participate in organized sports since 2018, and I'm in decent shape physically despite not doing much, and I eat generally quite healthy. We live in a semi-rural area so there's not much to do. Plus, regardless of your stance on that, it's my life to ruin, not anyone else's. 

Anyways, my brother is basically bumming off both my parents and because he isn't a minor, is allowed to play whenever he wants, for as long as he wants. This often means sessions of six hours or more. Meanwhile, I'm limited to four hours per day if that, and am required to go on family outings etc, while he isn't. I called bullshit on this and told my mom I wasn't going to the family cottage with my mom if my brother wasn't (my brother opted to go out with his girlfriend), and my grandparents this weekend (my dad works out of state), so she cancelled her cottage plan, and now I'm the villain, and I'm not allowed to play at all.

1,"AITA for making a Facebook post about someone without telling them? | My (22F) best friend (21M) recently went on a 3 month long trip to India to do volunteer work. He helped to build a water pipeline and taught kids in a local school about hygiene and sanitation. He also paid for the whole trip himself, costing over $3000. He is a pretty shy and quiet guy, so he didn’t tell many people about it before he left and I doubt he was going to when he got back if I didn’t do this.

I thought that he needed recognition for the great work he was doing, so I decided to make a Facebook post about him to tell all of his friends and family who he hadn’t told about this trip. I did this while he was away, about a week before he got home. Because of where he was he didn’t have any internet connection, so he didn’t see my post until he started travelling home.

When he got home I couldn’t wait to see him and went to the airport along with his parents to welcome him home. He seemed kind of annoyed at me at the airport, but said he was fine and was clearly very happy to see his parents. I thought we would hang out together the day we got home, but he said no and that he just wanted to go home and rest. I decided to text him that evening to ask again what was wrong. He told me he was pissed off at me for the Facebook post. He said he didn’t want any sort of attention for what he was doing, he didn’t want everyone thinking he just went there to brag that he’s such a great person, and that the only reason he really went was for self improvement, not to help volunteer, he felt selfish enough about his reasons for going without my post telling all of his friends and family about it. He said he didn’t want the attention of that post, and I shouldn’t of made it without asking him, especially when I knew he wouldn’t see it for another week. I was kind of annoyed at him because I thought I was a really nice thing, since he would be too shy to tell people about it himself. The post was so positive about him, I didn’t say anything bad.

0,"AITA for coming off as pregnant at my sister's wedding? I'm a newly sober alcoholic. | 
I am a woman in my late 20s and I've very recently started to realize I've got a binge drinking problem...

I've very recently started going to a therapist, and she is also referring me to a recovery program that I'll be starting soon. But as of now, I'm really early on in this whole process and I've only told my husband, who had been the only person to really notice I had a problem.

Last week was my sister's wedding. We aren't too close, she's almost ten years older than me. I wasn't in the bridal party, she had a small party of her friends. I wasn't upset or insulted by that.

At the wedding, there was an open bar, champagne at every table, and pretty much everyone was drinking. 

I got myself a glass of water and I felt like I stood out a little for not drinking. A couple people offered me drinks, my brother, my uncle and aunt, even family of the groom who were mingling with us. I'd always decline politely, ""no thanks"" ""I'm good for now"" Nobody asked any questions for a while. 

Until it was time for speeches and toasts. 

My aunt was pouring out champagne for everyone and I was like ""no thanks"" and she asked ""Oh why not?""

I didn't want to say much so I was just like ""oh just for personal reasons, I'm not drinking right now"" and she was like ""Are you..."" And wiggled her eyebrows in a way that seemed to mean something.

I had no fucking idea what she was getting at. The anxious part of my brain was filling that empty space with questions like ""Are you an alcoholic?"" ""Are you afraid you're gonna binge drink if you start drinking?"" Etc...

I know how dumb it sounds that I didn't realize, all I can say is that none of my friends or close family have kids, I don't think much about what signals a pregnancy. But I've had a couple people in my life get sober because of drinking problems. So that's the connection that I saw as obvious.

I just froze up and shrugged awkwardly.

I didn't think any more about it until later. My husband came to me and said that people were congratulating him on the baby. I was like ""what the fuck, what baby?"" And he was like ""yeah I asked the same thing, apparently your aunt is going around saying we're expecting. I was baffled.

It was only later that i understood. My sister came to me furious at stealing the spotlight from her on her wedding day, being jealous I'm not in the wedding party, making drama by making people think I was pregnant when I'm not, being all coy about not drinking when ""everyone knows what that means"" 

I told her that I wasn't drinking because I've had a drinking problem for a while, and needed to stop. And she just didn't believe me. She said that the timing was too convenient, that she's never seen a problem before, and that I was obviously bitter that I'm not the center of attention for once.

I didn't know what else to say or how to make her understand.

Our son has some mental problems and he spent few months in mental hospital. When he came back he seemed to be a lot better. He was taking his medicine, hanging out with his friends. He also made a new friend at hospital. 17 y.o boy. That boy lives closer to me, so when my son stayed with me(weekends), they’d hang out at my house. They were really close. 

Then they started fighting about something, I still don’t know what, and my son was incredibly stressed. I could hear him crying in his room, I tried to talk to him but he refused to. Me and his dad talked, we decided it would be best if he spent more time at his home, so he wouldn’t have to see his friend. 

It was fine for first two weeks, then he said he wanted to see his friend. We said it would be better if they didn’t see each other. He got really upset over that, but we told him that our decision was final. He started throwing tantrum and breaking stuff in his room. Next day he snuck out to see him and we caught him. We grounded him and took his electronics. He went mad at that point, he broke literally everything in his room.


I was just so damn tired, I couldn’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even talk to him. I told his dad that if he needed anything he could contact my parents and left. I went to another city and stayed there. I had 0 contact with my son or his dad. I got back after a month. My son just looked at me and acted like he didn’t see me.

1,"AITA for going over my doctor's head to get a temporary disabled parking permit? And muttering something about malpractice? | Five weeks ago I had a bad fall, and I saw my new doctor four days later. As of today, I can slowly limp 100m before I need to sit, and can probably do 500m on crutches if there's an emergency. My doctor refused twice to give me a temporary disabled parking permit. The second refusal was today, just after he gave me the results of my MRI (prepatellar bursitis). He said that it would be at least a few months before I'm fully recovered, but that he'd rather have a surgeon decide how long would be appropriate for the permit. I even asked him for an extra short (two month) permit just to tide me over, but he refused. The consultation ended and I went straight to the staff, quite emotional. I definitely used the ""malpractice"" word. He came over, his boss came over, he filled out the paperwork (with the assistance of the office staff), and then he stormed off.

I fully believe I'm \*entitled\* to a temporary permit, given my condition, the short-term prognosis, and the requirements for the permit. If I put too much weight on my leg, I'll collapse like a sack of warm truffles, and extended periods of standing/walking cause a sharp, grinding pain. I suspect he simply didn't want the hassle of filling out paperwork (he asked the staff what to write, line by line - English isn't his first language and the form was unfamiliar to him). It's not like I was asking for opiates - I'm not a bad patient - all I wanted was some relief from the pain of walking through parking lots for a short while. However, I worry that I've messed up my relationship with my new doctor. Going to the clinic staff when I didn't get what I wanted wasn't nice. Saying the m-word may have been a mistake. On the other hand, my chart does say ""bipolar"". Sigh.",False,False

When he went to fill up the tank on the way home he asked for half the money but I said no since I provided us with an entire tank to get to the destination.

1,"AITA for using Dungeons and Dragons to tell my brother-in-law my sister is cheating on him? | Pretty straight forward; 
My sister has been cheating on her husband for about 3 months (or at least that’s what she told me when I found out). They’ve been married about 18 months. 

So I found out when the idiot accidentally sent me a paragraph of pretty strongly incriminating flirting and instructions to meet up while in the bathroom at my house while her husband in the living room watching movies with me and my husband. It was very evidentially not intended for her husband, and even talked about when he would be at work - so on. 

I confronted her later that night and she flipped out. She first started saying he was abusing her and that she was doing it out of revenge (I found that hard to believe) but when I pushed on it she tried to play off that when she said abuse she just meant he wasn’t fulfilling her needs. 

I told her to grow the F up and talk to her husband instead of betraying him. She said she would. I promised I wouldn’t say anything. 
2 months down the line and she still hasn’t. 

We play a weekly game of Dungeons and Dragons, which I run for my husband, her and her husband, and a mutual friend of ours. 

Conveniently her and her husband’s characters are married in game. 
Eventually I boiled over and created a situation in the story which heavily implies her character was cheating on his, and I used real world locations and people (thinly disguised) to push the point. Finally it clicked in his head, and he thought it was a joke at first, but I kept a straight face and stared at him. He caught on and she started crying and stormed out. He went after her. 

This was two days ago and I’ve not heard from either. 

I feel like.. I betrayed her trust, while telling her not to do that to him. But at the same time.. I feel like she doesn’t deserve my respect given the situation.

1,"AITA for trying to simplify the Internet router? | This just happened and idk if I should apologize or not.

So in my house, my parents set their WiFi up in the garage (very poor choice) so we need to get WiFi extenders. But the ""optimal"" area is as close to the center of the house/room. We didn't have cables long enough to reach the area, so my dad took TWO routers and connected them until it reached the WiFi extender.

Now I'm no genius, but even i can see this is a big waste of equipment. But i didn't do anything about it cuz our Internet is now ok.

Today. My boyfriend asked if we had an extra router he can use for his own house. Now my dad and BFs relationship is really close. My dad has given him MANY things before. So i thought ""oh i can try to rearrange the cables so that the WiFi extender is closer and i can give one of the routers to my BF""

So i did some playing around. And I've managed to free up a router. The positioning of the WiFi extender is about 5ft closer away from the original spot though. However when i tested the internet, it's actually faster by 20mbps. (I asked my bf why this may be the case and he believes it has something to do with removing another ""bottle neck"" effect)

Anyways i did this and I'm happy. But my dad comes home and he goes ballistic. He is really upset I moved his router. It also didn't help my brother was there to tell him that I did this to give my BF a router. Which is true. BUT there is still an improvement with space and Internet speed with the new setup

So we argued and i tried to explain the improvement of this set up but he isn't having it. He goes ""you're not a network engineer stop trying to say you know these things"".


So now I'm in my room and i can hear them shit talk about me still.

I’m doing a photo shoot of the bridal party. This is the first photo shoot of many that I will do.

Awkward as it is, I do it. I tell her she’s gorgeous and ask her to tone it down so that the bride can be the focus of the pictures at the rehearsal dinner and the wedding.

1,"AITA for not wanting to go to family therapy? | Wife and I have two kids, an 8 year old girl and an 11 year old boy. My wife became a stay at home mom for a while after each of them was born but now she works a full time job like me. 

The thing that bothers me is that the kids pay 0 attention to me unless my wife tells them to or I'm lecturing them. If they need anything they'll always ask my wife. Help with homework, trouble at school, wanting something new, wanting to go out... They always ask my wife. 

Which ends up making me the bad one because most of the interactions that I have with them is when they do something wrong or if they start acting up. That isn't to say that my wife leaves the task to me, she does the same as well but she also gives them good moments which negates that, while I mostly get the bad ones.

I work a lot and I travel quite a few times and my wife has said that the kids probably didn't bond with me enough because of it. Which is not something that I could have avoided because my career is very important to me as well as my family. 

We tried a lot of things, currently my wife and I have a system where we take turns with their tasks so that we both get to spend the same time with them equally. But we noticed that unless the task was something they HAD to do, they would just avoid it when it was my turn to do it.  

That was when my wife suggested family therapy, she found a good therapist with good recommendations and such. The thing is, I don't want my time with my kids to be inside of a therapist's office and the thought that for my kids to like me I need to get professional help while they like my wife just fine is hurtful.

My wife said that I was being immature for not accepting this and said I needed to accept that our methods had failed. When I suggested that maybe we were being too soft with the kids she ended up getting extremely angry at me and now she only speaks to me in front of the kids.

While he never formally adopted me, he played a major role in my upbringing, and I am very grateful for all that he has done for me. Unfortunately, he passed away many years ago, and he never had any children. 

Fast forward to today, my wife and I recently had a son, and to honor the memory of my mentor, I decided (with my wife's approval) to name my kid Dimitri Petrovitch Williams. Williams being my last name, and Petrovitch being my son's middle name. However, it seems like it's only my wife and I who likes this name, as her extended family has been quite upset over it, saying things like ""What kinda name is Dimitri?"", or ""You ain't white, you ain't Russian, why did you give your son such as a white name."" 

It's true that there's no part of me that's Russian (I an barely speak Russian), but I feel like he's been such a big part of my upbringing that I had to honor him somehow. I confided in my friends too, and they said something along the lines of ""You a black man and you gotta be proud of your own culture. You gave your son an identity that he's not even a part of, he's gonna have a hard time in school with that name.""

1,"AITA for not wanting to cover/swap shifts with coworkers who are ‘sick’ with period pain | I’m a girl and I work in a pretty laid back restaurant. The majority of our staff are also women. 

The environment is generally pretty chill and we’ve all become decent friends. We’re all happy to help each other out by swapping shifts/covering them if anyone is ever sick or busy etc. 

Get ready for TMI. Personally, I don’t have much trouble when it comes to my period. I rarely get cramps, and when I do just taking a couple painkillers fixes it. I do get kinda crabby and emotional sometimes, but I try not to let it ruin my day/shifts. 

However, all the other girls I work with often take days off as a result of period pain. 3 times in the last month I’ve gone out of my way to swap and cover shifts to help out my coworkers who ‘can’t’ work as a result of period pain. It’s beginning to annoy me because they’re taking multiple shifts a week off for something that I barely consider painful. 

Of course I know that I can just decline to take/swap a shift, but last time I was approached by a girl to cover a shift, she called me a dickhead for not taking the shift even though I said I wasn’t busy (I didn’t have anything planned but I didn’t want to work another shift, especially for someone who I believe is overreacting to the amount of pain they’re experiencing) 

AITA in the situation? Particularly when I decline to take a shift that I would’ve taken if the person was genuinely ill? I just really don’t feel that period pain is a good enough reason to not work. ",False,False
1,AITA for firing an employee who didn't participate in company sponsored events? | I am the lead senior visualization artist on my team and had to make a decision to let somebody go on Friday. The problem was that she never participated in company sponsored events or made any indication that she was interested in going. Company cookout? No show. Company pod outing to skiing? No show. Even the mixer that was held after work \*in the building\* and she didn't show. In addition to this in morning meetings on projects she is very quite and sometimes doesn't say a word. Unfortunately had to have a conversation with the other senior artists and we all agreed that this position needs somebody who is communicative and out going so we decided to let her go and try to fill the position with somebody else. When I told my wife about it she told me that I may have jumped the gun a bit and should have mabe brought this issue up with the employee again before making the choice. Do you think I was justified?,False,False
1,"AITA for refusing to pull forward at a drive through fast food window when nobody was behind me? | I order and pay for my food like normal and after getting my drink someone sticks their head out of the window and says ""Would you please pull up and I'll bring your food out to you?""

I said ""There's no one behind me tho""

And the guy said, ""Yeah but I'm trying to get my times down and it's still running with you sitting here.""

And I said, ""Yeah see and I think it's important for the time to accurately reflect how fast you're delivering the food.""

Then he said, ""Sir....I've asked you nicely to please just pull up.""  

So I said, ""I understand that but I think it's important for the times to be accurate.""  

And he said, ""Oh the times are accurate. Would you just please pull up?""

And this went back and forth a few more times with no one pulling into the drive through behind me.

0,"WIBTA If I put my ex's dog down and didn't tell him about it? | Let's start with the dog. His name is Scooter and he has arthritis and bad legs. We have been through a lot together and I'm not ready for him to cross the rainbow bridge just yet. I just need to have a plan in place for when he does need to go the big farm in the sky. He spent most of his life with my ex and his family. He is basically my ex's childhood pet. My ex (who we shall call Steven) and I then became primary caretakers for about 2 years until our break up. I have been the dogs primary caretaker for the last year. 


The reasons I am hesitant: 
To put it bluntly: my ex is a psycho. He was a volatile and abusive drunk and he would lash out at me and Scooter, threaten us, threaten to harm himself, drive aggressively to scare me. He even crashed the car on purpose because i had the nerve to hop in the car and ask him not drive because he was hammered. He would tell me that I would never be able to outrun him so I shouldn't try, he would scream and curse and tell me he hated me, he would cry and say I was all he had in this world. He bit me, threw rocks at me because the thought I was talking to other guys. Quit his job, which forced me to work 2 jobs, 7 days a week to support all the drinking and weed and cigarettes. He hit me, choked me, screamed at me, laughed at me while I cried, accused me of lying when I tried to explain that he hit me again during one if his blackouts. I have absolutely zero interest in EVER speaking to him again. 

The last time he saw me and the dog he was trying to beat the shit out of us. He got blood all over my car, threatening to hurt himself, to hurt me. Physically picked up Scooter and threw him on the ground. The last time Scooter saw him, he cowered on fear. I spent an hour holding the old dog and crying in the car after I finally kicked my ex out of my life for the last time. I told him he wasn't allowed to have Scooter if he was going to mistreat him. So essentially I assumed ownership of the dog with little argument from Steven. 

I don't want to break no contact and bring this traumatizing person back into my life. Not after I've gone so far in improving my self worth. 

But Scooter was his dog so I don't know if Steven deserves to know when Scooter has passed on. Should I let him say goodbye? AITA for even thinking of putting down a dog that spent so much time not being mine? My normal isn't normal so I really don't know what's okay in this situation. I'm worried because it's getting colder and Scooters arthritis is getting worse. I don't want him to live in pain.

1,"AITA for voicing my concerns to my brother's boss at a company party? | So my older brother is a police officer. Last night the PD was holding a holiday party for officers and their families, and my parents and I were invited as my brother's guests. I got to meet all my brother's coworkers as well as his bosses, but being much younger than most of the people there, I wasn't really involved in any conversations. I spent most of the evening just listening to everyone else around me, and what I learned is that many of my brother's fellow officers can't retell a story the same way it was told to them. Basically Person A would tell Person B a story, and when Person B went to tell the story to Person C, it was told slightly differently with changes to details. There were several instances of this happening, and this is where I'll accept being the AH, but I recorded two different conversations on my phone because I wanted to show my brother later.

Anyway, toward the end of the night the Chief of Police was making his rounds at each table to talk to the guests. When he finally got to our table, he talked to my parents first and then turned to me. We made small talk, but then he asked me what I thought about following my brother's footsteps. At this point I was kind of annoyed - not with the Chief - but with my brother's coworkers not being able to retell a story right. This isn't verbatim but pretty much what I said was:

""I'm worried about the police in our town. A big part of your job is writing reports, which hold a ton of value in court and can really impact a person's life. Based on what I've seen and heard tonight though, your officers aren't capable of reporting information accurately. It makes me wonder how many police reports are incorrect and how many lives have been ruined because of it.""

To the Chief's credit, he wasn't visibly angry or upset. He said that what I said gave him something to think about, and if I didn't mind, could I come in next Monday to talk more with him about my concerns. I'm still debating whether or not to take him up on this. Anyway, he left our table after that and I didn't interact with him anymore that night. Toward the end of the evening as everyone was getting ready to leave, my brother approached our table and told us that we were going now. He didn't even say bye to anyone and rushed us out the door. When my parents asked him what that was about, he turned on me and said I had fucked with his career. He then told my parents about what I had said to the Chief. Now my parents are angry with me and have been lecturing me (last night and this morning) about what I did.

My entire family is mad at me. My brother is calling me an entitled brat. My parents think I'm too old for them to ground, but they did take away my car keys so I can't go anywhere. They said my actions last night were highly inappropriate and that I was potentially jeopardizing my brother's job with the PD.

1,"AITA for convincing my parents to take away our TV and xbox? | So, I'm going to be in high school next year, and I know for a fact my schedule will be extremely, extremely busy: I'm taking 4 APs, playing varsity soccer (tryouts have already happened for next year's fall sports) and year-round competitive club lacrosse, am going to join the debate team, and have an internship with our governor. 

&#x200B;

My goal is eventually to get into a top school  like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, or Georgetown, and I only see my schedule getting busier and busier as the years go on. So I figured I should try to get rid of any distractions that could get in the way of my productivity, and decided to come up with a list. At the top of the list was the TV and the xbox, and I convinced my parents to get rid of them by telling them it would help my productivity.

&#x200B;

The problem is, this made my older sister pissed at me. She watches a lot of Netflix, and is pissed at me. I literally don't see why-- if she wants to watch Netflix, she can do so on her laptop.

1,"AITA for suddenly moving out of my house and leaving my roommates to take the rent? | I moved to a new city last summer and was looking for roommates. Two guys I went to high school with moved into a three bedroom house. They were originally just going to eat the extra rent as the original third roommate decided not to move in. They weren’t actively looking for a new third roommate, but welcomed me in after they lived there a couple months.

I recently got engaged and am getting married in the summer of 2021. My fiancée found a newly refurbished house that would be perfect for us to live in when we’re married, but it will definitely be unavailable over a year from now. I want to move into it now so that we have it when we get married. I never officially signed a lease with my current roommates, and feel like since they didn’t originally seek an extra third roommate, it would be okay for them to have the extra rent for a couple months (one of the roommates is also moving out over the summer, and I’m not sure if we could find someone to take his spot).

Since it was her 13th birthday, she invited me to a convention and took me along to the sushi place she was going to have dinner, so I looked up the specifications of the legal age for a Reddit account, as a way of thanks, and wow, the minimum age is 13! So I told her this and told her she doesn't need to ask her dad, but S said, ""I don't want to go against my father"" but I kept telling her that it was okay, and to clarify, her parents are very lenient and wouldn't mind if she explained herself, then she blocked my number. I was only telling her that she doesn't need permission, and giving her evidence, but she blocked me for no reason. She has a habit of taking things the wrong way and even blocked a friend of mine for not texting her even though he's known to be the person to not start conversations but continue them instead.

0,"AITA for calling my son “John” “Jack” and supporting his preference? | Real names here as it’s the only way to properly tell the story.

In 1989 my wife and I had our first child, a boy, and we named him John (middle initial F) (Last Name). We named him after my dad and their names are identical. My dad was known better by his nickname Jack. My son and my dad were exceptionally close. They hung out together and knew secrets about each other. It was adorable. Then my dad died in 1999 when my son was ten and that stopped. As my son has become a man his physical resemblance to my dad is uncanny. It brings me joy to watch him.

I have a brother seven years younger and we don’t get along well. In 2002 he and his now ex wife had a baby boy. They named him Jack (middle initial P) (Last Name). He and his wife went on and on for years about how Jack was the reincarnation of our dad. It was insufferable but I bit my tongue.

When my son went to college he adopted the nickname Jack. He wanted his own identity. Everyone who knows him since 2007 knows him as Jack, including his wife. My wife and I were good with that and even though we go back and forth with Jack/John we like it. But I’ve always referred to my son as John with my brother. He’s angry by nature, very volatile and I don’t want to kick the hornet’s nest. Yesterday I slipped while discussing my son, referred to him as Jack and my brother flipped out. The gist of his argument is that John had no right to become “Jack” and that I’m an asshole for supporting it. My argument is that when we named our son John after our dad, 13 years before his son was born, we also claimed the John nicknames, including Jack, in the same way Michael gets Mike, Mikey, etc. I added that neither my wife nor I said anything in 2002 when you poached our name even though we both felt that you and your ex were assholes for doing it.

1,"AITA for siding with my dad after he berated my girlfriend? | My dad has always been hard on me but he’s always seen to it that I’m taken care of. He’s allowed my girlfriend and I to live in a home that he owns, rent free. I’m working on getting my own place soon but since I just graduated from college it’s kind of hard to afford my own place. My girlfriend adopted a shelter dog recently. Her previous owner neglected her and she spent most of her life in a cage. Since she was neglected she was never house trained and she can be destructive around the house. When my girlfriend and I leave for work she’ll claw at the door and leave scratch marks and leave bite marks on some of the furniture.  My girlfriend wasn’t aware the dog had these problems but she did know she needed to house train it. When my dad learned about this he was pissed and he told my girlfriend to get her dog under control and that until it’s trained she either has to cage it or leave it outside in the cold because he doesn’t want it messing up his house. Since she spent most of her life in a cage my girlfriend doesn’t want to cage her dog but he told me to make sure this rule is enforced. 

Yesterday my dad told me he was coming over to talk to me about some things and to check on the house. My girlfriend has been slacking on training her dog so she still not house broken and destructive and I haven’t been enforcing my dad’s rule. I tell my girlfriend that she’s going to need to cage the dog until my dad leaves but she refuses. My dad comes over and sees the dog not caged and he asks me if it’s trained and she tells him it is. Things are going well until my dad sees the dog chewing some furniture. He yells at the dog and this causes her to pee herself revealing that the dog is still destructive and not house broken. My dad begins going on a tirade calling my girlfriend a lying bitch and telling her that he’s going to throw her and her damn mutt out. Throughout him yelling at her I stay quiet and don’t intervene. He tells me he’s disappointed in me because I betrayed his trust. I tell him I’m sorry and that from now on the dog will be caged. After he leaves my girlfriend is in tears because I didn’t say anything while he was yelling at her but mostly because I sided with my dad and will now be enforcing his rule. I think caging a dog who spent most of its life in a cage is cruel but it’s my dad’s house and he can make the rules.",False,False

His sister saw we had donuts and got excited. My friend offered her one of his jelly donuts, but she didn’t want it because she hates them. She wanted the sprinkle donut, which was mine. So my friend offered me one of his jellies for the sprinkle, but I said no because I don’t like jelly donuts either and I was still really hungry.

0,"AITA for not saying Happy Mother’s Day or Happy Birthday to parents who “disowned” me a month ago? | Long story short my parents had a life plan for me that I didn’t agree with, and the past year I’ve abandoned their dreams for my own. I have a wonderful SO that they blame my “rebellion” on. They hate SO with more passion than I’ve ever seen them have. 

I had to have surgery in April and while I was under anesthesia, my mom picked a fight with my SO, and it escalated to my dad saying he would murder SO and told SO that they wanted both of us out of their lives. So, we decided to move across the country to where SO’s family is. 

Less than a week after, they tried to “take back” their disowning me and I wouldn’t have any of it. IMHO you can’t take something like that back. They’re saying technically they didn’t disown me (they never said the word disown, only that they wanted us out of their lives), so we can go back to having a relationship if I can accept they will always treat SO with disdain and disrespect. Obviously I declined, and we’re now far, far away surrounded by people who love and accept both of us.

My dad’s birthday was a few days ago and after much consideration I didn’t say anything or get him anything. I have a lot of hard feelings still and it wouldn’t have been genuine. Both my parents blew up over my blatant disrespect, so I blocked them on social media. They’ve complained to our whole family about how they don’t understand why I’m doing this over what they call a misunderstanding.

1,"AITA for wanting to keep my cat even though my girlfriend is allergic? | So in the past few months my (21M) living situation has changed quite a lot. I moved out of my abusive parents’ house, and when I was moving all my stuff into my friend’s flat, where I now live full time, I brought the family cat along. Although the other members of my family could take care of him, we both liked each other the most so I brought him down.

For context, my girlfriend has some inflammatory conditions that make prone to corneal ulcers. She had one at the start of 2019 and it terrified her as it left her with a corneal scar, so now she’s vigilant about cleaning her eyes and keeping away from triggers. One of which has turned out to be my cat.

Whenever she’s up here she sneezes all night, rubs her eyes and makes a mountain of tissues as she blows her nose every two minutes. She constantly complains of dry, itchy eyes, and even though I’ve recommended antihistamines, she’s tried them and says they don’t do much for her. Since then, she’s begged me to take the cat back up to my dad’s (with whom I still have little contact) as it’s not good for her or the cat. First, her argument for herself is that she doesn’t want to come up anymore because she’s worried about her eyes, and she spends the whole time miserable. She says she can’t even hug me anywhere else because of the cat hair on my clothes will trigger a sneezing fit or irritate her eyes (and he is a long-haired cat so he sheds everywhere). I’ve recommended trying another type of antihistamine, but she refuses.

Her argument for the cat is that this situation isn’t good for the cat. I’ve moved from a house in a secluded council estate to a top floor flat right on two main roads. My cat is very much an outdoor cat, he’s always wanting out to hunt mice and birds. He’s always preferred being outside since he was a kitten. I can’t let him out here as the drop from my window is too high, or let him out the door as he can’t get back in. I don’t want to let him run around because he doesn’t know the area as well as my parents’ area that he’s known all his life, and I’m worried about the roads. He cries to get out at night for hours on end, keeping me up to the point where my uni work is starting to get affected from lack of sleep. My girlfriend is insistent this isn’t a good life for him, although the attempts to train him seem to be doing ok, where he uses the litter box instead of going outside, and I love his company even when it’s just the one room.

My girlfriend is now threatening to stop coming down to my place entirely, which I don’t really want considering we both consider it a safe haven away from her family. She argues that my parents will keep him fed and watered, and he’ll be back in a familiar environment, going out whenever he pleases. But she’s never had a cat herself, and I don’t think she realises it’s not easy to  let go like that, especially when I barely see my family anymore.

My daughters (19 and 21) and I ALWAYS take a vacation to Canada around this time of year to visit the family and just relax, and it's always just been the three of us. Now that DH and I have officially tied the knot, I was planning to have him along too. I thought he'd enjoy seeing the sights and where I grew up, and he had the vacation time. We were all pretty excited for this and were discussing the plans we had made, and it seemed nothing was amiss until his son (16) exploded on us last night.

He was extremely rude but the gist of what he was saying was that we were leaving him out of things, his dad has chosen a new family (absolutely not true), and that he might as well go live with his mother instead. Now, this is unfair for a number of reason. One, HE IS SIXTEEN. School has only just started up and it would be extremely silly to pull him out of all his classes to go on this trip. Two, this is a trip that has always just been us girls. I didn't invite DH around when he was only my boyfriend, though I certainly wasn't leaving him out because I was uninterested in him. It just made sense to take him along now he's officially my husband. Three, the boy has shown ZERO interest in doing family activities despite me inviting him along multiple times. He doesn't eat dinner with us, he won't go out when invited, all he does is go on his computer and hide in his room all day and quite frankly, doesn't seem to like any of us at the moment.

DH agrees with me on all those counts and chalks his explosion down to teenage angst, but his mother has sent quite a few angry texts to him saying that I'm blocking his own son out of his family. If he had expressed a little interest in going with us at any stage of the planning, things might have been a little different, but he showed absolutely no signs of wanting to go at all.

1,"WIBTA having my baseball team over for a Christmas party after my Fiance' said she didn't want me to? | Backstory: My Fiance' and I are both 25, been together for 5.5 years and living together for 3. We own our current house jointly. I've been playing baseball with the same group of guys for the last 3 years and we've all gotten quite close. There's also a couple guys on the team I've been close with since I was 19. Two-three times per year we host large potlucks / parties together. Usually they involve a lot of beer, drinking games and conversations until ~2am. These guys are mostly just sports and drinking buddies - none of us really hang out sober 1-on-1.


I haven't hosted anything for **a while.** I can't even remember the last time I had the entire group of guys (15, usually only the core 10 show up) at my house - it's got to be at least a year. They  asked me to host the Christmas party this year - I brought it up with my Fiance' and she politely asked that I didn't.  She doesn't like these guys too much because ""they're all drinkers, all they do is drink."" She also finds them immature - they somewhat are truthfully, which is why they're sports / weekend buddies and not grab a cup of coffee after work friends. On the other hand my Fiance' regularly has her friends over (and will drink quite heavily every now and again too, sometimes puking the night of or morning after). I don't really like her friends either but the difference is I don't tell her that. I go, hang out and pretend like I'm having a blast, then when I've had enough I excuse myself and let them carry on with their night. The last time they were over (2 weeks) the 4 of them stayed up smoking weed and drinking until almost 5 in the morning. (To be fair she never minds when I have other friends over even if they're spending the night, It's just that she dislikes ""noisy"" party atmosphere type hangouts with moderately loud music, excited cheering etc. my ball team has.)


I brought up a few points with her. I'd do all the work, there was no expectation for her to show up & if she wanted to hang out in the bedroom all night she was welcome to. I'd clean up the next day too. I told her I felt it was unfair I wasn't able to have my friends over in my own home and pointed out the hypocrisy of how I was supportive and understanding when she wanted her friends over but now she's making me feel bad for wanting to do the same thing. She took it pretty well and basically said that she sees my point, I can have them over, but she still doesn't want them over and can't change how she feels about that. Basically a ""You can do it but I won't like it"" sort of thing. 


She's not sulking about it and she's not being rude or short at all. She just wanted to make sure I knew how she felt and that she would prefer if I didn't have everyone over. Despite this I've decided I'm still gonna host Christmas. It just seems unfair that I've been so open to her friends coming over, however she's not being the same about mine.

A lot of this was really tough for me at the beginning, but my partner assured me they were just good friends. A while back when my partner was showering after dinner, he got a text which popped up on the screen (not whatsapp) from the ex saying 'I really miss you' while his phone was charging on his bedside table. I didn't think much of it, but it certainly tainted the 'we're just friends' angle. 

We've subsequently had a few quite major discussions about his conduct and how I find it upsetting etc. I made a post about this in a different sub, so feel free to check that out for context. 

**Now**: My partner and I have decided to hold a Christmas/Holiday party this year for our family and close friends. We decided on the venue together, what the vibe was, and split costs down the line. He asked me to send him the email addresses of people I'd like to invite, as he managed the online invitation process, with me as a guest (not admin).

I respond to the RSVP and see that his ex has pressed 'attending'. Granted, we didn't review each other's attendees and I never said 'I don't feel comfortable with your ex there', but given that my close friends and family are there, I genuinely never thought he'd invite the ex, especially given our history. 

I'm now trying to see the Holiday party as a way to engage with the ex, and maybe re-examine my stance on their relationship, but I can't help feeling overlooked and angry. When I asked my partner about this, he said 

'Oh it was just a name on a list, nothing more', and; 'I invited <ex's name> friends too, so it would be awkward not to <ex>'. Missing the glaring awkwardness that my partner invited someone who clearly had/has feelings for him to a party with my close friends and family, many of who will ask 'so how do you know <partner>?'. 

I really can't tell if I've been TA, if my partner has been TA or if I'm being gaslighted. AITA for not wanting the ex here?",False,False
0,"AITA for asking my boyfriend to kick his ex-girlfriend off of his Netflix account? | Boyfriend and I have been together 8 months. He was broken up with the ex for like a month before he and I became official. 

My boyfriend and the ex don’t talk, as far as I know. But she’s still on his Netflix account.

My thing is, I feel like if you’re no longer in a relationship, you’d probably cut ties like this. 

My boyfriend gave me the Netflix  password as well. But sometimes I get locked out of his Netflix because there can only be two screens going at a time. So my boyfriend, the ex, and I can’t all use it separately at once. That’s how I first found out she’s still on it. 

I asked my boyfriend why he doesn’t change his password and he sort of brushed it off and said he felt bad or something. 

I’m honestly annoyed. I can afford my own Netflix but it’s the principle, for me. It sort of bothers me that he would want to pay for someone who he’s not dating anymore. And he acts as if this girl was so awful to him as well, so it’s not like it ended on good terms.

1,"AITA for being a Karen? | This morning I went to my local supermarket before work. I only had ten minutes to light food shopping so I went to the Deli section and took a number. There were no other customers waiting for orders and there were about three deli employees behind the counter. They were seemingly doing other tasks but after I took a number, a male employee said he would get to me when he was done with what he was doing.  

Nevertheless, I waited a good six minutes and he still hadn't waited on me yet. The other two woman ignored me despite me standing right at the counter, waiting patiently. When it was apparent, he wasn't getting to me anytime soon, I walked away disgusted. I picked up some items and checked out all within the ten minute window.

As I drove away, I called the store and asked to speak to the manager on duty. I told her that the employees made me wait too long and that even though they were engaged in other tasks, I should have been waited on as there were no other customers waiting. She said she would go and address the issue with the deli workers. I hung up unsatisfied, because I feel I deserved compensation.

0,"AITA for being a parking permit patty at my college? | I got to a fairly large university and like every university parking is a luxury. I stay in one of the dorms and have a permit to park there. The lot is always full from residents. Sometimes we have people that park there for class, orientation, etc. I’m a jerk for not caring but I don’t care you’re taking away a spot from the residents of the dorm. 

Usually me or someone else can’t find a parking spot so we look at the permit and it’s either not the right color (residents use purple) or they don’t have a parking permit at all. So I call campus police. Campus police even encourages you to call them if you see an unauthorized vehicle in a spot. 

When the lot is full and the residents can’t find spots I go around the lot and see the vehicles that aren’t supposed to be there. I call campus police and they ticket the car. The ticket is like $50. Why do I think I’m the asshole? Well occasionally the car will get towed if it sits there all day.

The service was complete and when I went to retrieve the vehicle I am informed that there was a ""mishap"" and they ""accidentally"" ran my car through the car wash despite my request not to.  The car manufacturer doesn't make that part anymore, but they were able to find an OEM part online and made the purchase.

1,"AITA for not forcing my husband to do hands-on childcare yet? | Husband and I have a two year old son. We both work full time and have a nanny that comes mornings while my mother handles afternoons for us. Recently I asked my sister if she could watch my son for two nights, as I’ll be going on a business trip during a week my mom will be out of town and the nanny doesn’t do overnights. My sister is a freelancer with a flexible schedule and says she’s always happy to watch my son for me (she has three middle school aged kids and she’s taken our son a few nights in a row before when husband and I were out of town), but this time she got kind of….hostile? with me over how it’s my husband’s “job” and he needs to be the one doing the night care. 

My husband (like a lot of parents!) isn’t super in to the baby stage, and prefers not to take on the bulk of the hands-on parenting yet. He’s really excited for the “kid” stage to start in a few years, but prefers a more traditional parenting dynamic for now. I took a the full three months of maternity leave, so by the time I was back to work full time, I already had a great routine down with the baby, and my husband pointed out that it was much more logical for me to handle the things I was already good at, rather than stress out our son by leaving him with someone who wasn’t an experienced caregiver (as opposed to my mother and sister and me). I’ve always been as encouraging with him as possible to take on more childcare, but no matter how much I tell him he’s a great dad (and doing it differently from me isn’t doing it wrong!), he insists that it’s best for our son to have “an expert” handling things instead of someone who “is still learning and therefore obviously won’t be as good”. 

My sister says I’m “mistreating” my son by “denying him time with his dad” because I’m “enabling” my husband being “an abjectly shitty father”. I was stunned by this because I feel like he’s a great dad, he was super supportive during my pregnancy and talks all the time about all the stuff they’re going to do with each other once son gets big enough. It’s not like he refuses to spend time with our son, or complains about him. Plus, he is the one pushing for us to start trying next year for the next baby.

I just don’t feel like our situation is out of the ordinary? Or that my husband is any worse a dad than any other dad I know! All of my close friends with kids also work, and I don’t really notice their husbands being any more “active” about parenting than my husband is. And honestly, my brother in law seemed to be the same way when my niece and nephews were baby aged. My own mom was a SAHM so she handled pretty much all of the parenting, though I guess our dad didn't end up stepping up the way I am expecting my husband to. 

My sister keeps saying “well how do you KNOW he’ll actually make an effort in a few years?” and “why would you give him another baby to ignore”, which is really messing with my head, but I don’t think I’m being an asshole by having a traditional parenting dynamic?",False,False
1,"AITA for bringing sidedish to Christmas dinner? | My extended family had their Christmas dinner last Sunday. For the past 5 years, I brought my scalloped potatoes to Christmas dinner. They are amazing and everyone loves them. This year, however, I was asked not bring my scalloped potatoes, because my Aunt Karen wanted to cook scalloped potatoes this year. I agreed not to bring mine. However, other family members reached out to me to ask if I would be bringing my scalloped potatoes. Initially I told them No, Aunt Karen was bringing it this year. But after some convincing from other family members. I cooked my scalloped potatoes and brought them to the dinner. Everyone devour my scalloped potatoes and people barely touch my Aunt Karen's scalloped potatoes. Honestly, Karen's scalloped potatoes were mushy, salty and not cheesy. At the end of the dinner, Karen was noticeable upset. She complained no one liked her potatoes, she had worked so hard on them and it was her mother's recipe etc. She was crying, feeling embarrassed which turned into anger at me for bringing my potatoes when I was asked not too. Anyways, other family members tried to step in to calm her down, some even try to eat Karen's potatoes. But Karen was too upset and had to leave the room.

1,"AITA for advising my brother to back out of a school competition? | My brother is 14 and I'm 17m.

He's always been creative and into drawing and he's really good at it. Last month he applied for this regional competition for high school students, which includes art, drama, music etc. The theme is ""modern injustice"" (loose translation) and the competitors have to imagine some situation involving that and create art about it.

Basically my brother drew a poster of two guys kissing and included titles from articles about homophobic attacks, LGBT rights and such. It was good but sort of controversial for where we are. His teachers rejected the entry probably because of that, though they said the reason was the bad words and names in article titles.

So my brother was pretty angry and wanted to complain to the principal with his friend. Our parents told him not to do that because his grades and teachers are more important. And well, I sort of agree with them.

He already gets ostracized and called gay and I just don't want him to make things worse, even if he's in the right. That's why when he complained to me, I told him to just back out or draw something different because this is not going to seem that important in a few years. He's just a kid, it's not like he's going to change much if we're being realistic. It's more likely he'll just get more hurt.

Yesterday I thought we should do a little something for her bday morning (I also do this for my bio kids and I think it’s important to treat them all equal)... so I stopped at Walmart and grabbed some balloons and a banner and a book and “happy birthday” headband. 

Last night I got these things out when she went to bed and my fiancé was hurt. He said he felt left out and like I was doing more for her than he was. His feelings were hurt and he told me, which of course made me feel bad.

0,"AITA For telling my MIL ""That's why you'll never get to watch him without us there,"" when she continuously complains about us disciplining our son? | I love my MIL, but I have so many stories that would make bank (karma, that is) on r/justnomil. So, although I won't go into detail, this isn't just a one-time thing that she has said or done to make me upset, hurt, or uncomfortable. For example, she has said ""I can't wait until I can get *son's name* away from you and all to myself."" This made me extremely uncomfortable, but I truly don't believe she meant anything by it. She's just a freaking weirdo. 

Anyway, to the matter at hand.

Every single time she witnesses my husband or I discipline our son (1 1/2), she gets really upset and says something about it. It's not *how* we discipline him, according to her, it's that she believes that he doesn't deserve to be disciplined at all, ever, because he's ""a perfect angel"". 

I love my son, obviously. But part of that love also means I need to correct him when he does wrong or acts out. 

I was getting tired of her comments every time she witnessed us disciplining him (even small things, like saying no to him!), and told her what my husband and I have already decided about her watching our son; that she won't be, because we know that she would let him do whatever he wants and we don't want our son to be affected by that, negatively speaking. I said it after she huffed and shouted ""He didn't do anything wrong!"" to my husband (her son) as he carried our son out of the room due to him throwing a huge fit in the middle of a church service.

My husband wasn't even actually disciplining him; he took him out of the room to calm him down because he was having a hard day (teething two top canines can be rough!). My husband always takes him out of the room as to not cause a distraction (we were at church) with his crying and throwing a fit. Bringing him outside usually calms him down. After his fit, he calms down and then hugs us (like I said, he's just having a hard time, needs a hug and some lovin', not always discipline), then we bring him back inside. Which is what happened in this instance, but of course MIL did not know this.

Anyway, she was super offended. Which, I understand why- because she wont be able to watch her grandson. But if she had kept her mouth shut, then my husband and I would not have made this decision, ya know what I mean? 

She left without saying anything to me (she kissed our son goodbye, though).

I told my husband and he didn't care. He said that it was getting on his nerves, too, and he would have said the same thing.

I don't want to be an asshole lol I try so very hard to be nice to this woman, but I also feel like I may have lashed out a little too hard.

0,"AITA for not letting my brother, who was recently paralyzed with nothing to do, borrow my PS4? | Some backstory: Me and my (1 year older) brother have not been on good terms in a long time. In school he was my biggest bully, and as he got older things got worse.  He lived a violent, reckless lifestyle, always getting into fights, getting involved in gang activity. He's been to jail multiple times, and honestly it was a reprieve for me and my mom when he was locked up, cause it was hell living with him. He'd threaten violence (most often implied, sometimes outright) to me and her if he didn't get his way. He even put his hands on her once - that was the only time I ever fought back against him.

&#x200B;

He hasn't been above stealing from family either. He stole my mom's money or car multiple times. He's ""borrowed"" money from other families claiming he was gonna use it to go to school or get a car for work, only to use it to buy drugs to sell.

&#x200B;

Having been a broke kid in high school to being an even broker college student, I didn't often have much of value for him to steal. But I was always an avid gamer, so my game consoles were an exception. He's stolen systems from me three times in my life. After the most recent incident, I swore I'd never let him in my life again. A couple years passed.

&#x200B;

Then he got shot. I wasn't surprised. No one was. We all knew his lifestyle would get him shot eventually. He survived, but is permanently paralyzed from the chest down. I didn't go see him when he was in the hospital. I was glad he wasn't dead, but I had meant it when I said I would no longer let him into my life. Everyone told me he was doing better, no longer running the streets (like he'd be able to), that he was settling down. My mom, as much of a pain in the ass he was to her, still loved him, and  wanted me to forgive him. But I refused.

&#x200B;

Then. . . my mom died a month ago. . .

&#x200B;

I knew I'd be seeing him at the wake. And I knew my mom would want for me not to hate him. So I resolved to give him a chance. And, yeah, he was much calmer, more mature then ever before. I had the first decent conversation with him in years. I told him that I forgave him.

&#x200B;

A few minutes ago he contacted me for the first time since the wake, asking to borrow my PS4. He says he's bored out of his mind not being able to really go outside, and he needs something to do, and I mean, I understand that and feel for him. But I REALLY don't want to let him. Partially cause I just got it half a year ago, partially cause of the history. But I feel like a dick for not letting him.

1,"AITA For staying with my boyfriend against his mother's wishes? | This will probably be a YTA, but I would like some thoughtful input from all of yall. No throwaway because I am lazy.

I (F23) stay at my boyfriend's (M23, together for 5 years) house quite often (every other week for about a week or so). I hardly ever leave his room other than to go pee or get food. I do buy, and typically only eat, my own food, so I do not steal any of the house's food (except maybe an occasional ramen). I am also very quiet and don't play anything without headphones (I bring this up because his brother rarely uses headphones and his stuff is super loud). I am not college and unemployed, but I am working on fixing/figuring out some medical/mental health issues before I return.

Now about the house. My boyfriend lives here with his mom and his autistic brother (M19) who still goes to school (post graduation) and will be going to a ""college"" ment for people with disabilities soon (he attributes nothing and rarely does chores, even when asked). His mother and father are in the midst of a divorce (100% the father's fault, he cheated), but since he was the main breadwinner she will have a hard time affording the house (that she is keeping) and etc. She has asked my boyfriend to pay his ""share""/rent to help out, which is fine, but it has now prevented him from moving out into his own apartment (shaired with friends). He worries about her financial sustainability and even worries if he will ever be able to move out.

Now here comes the AITA part: She has said to my boyfriend (not to me, but he has told me as well) that she might start asking me for rent. I understand her plight, but I have no money and no way to get any. I dont take up any household resources (except maybe toilet paper, but BF pays for that).

Her main reason why she wants me out/paying is because she feels ""like I cant have friends over/talk to people on the phone while (I) am here,"" which I do understand. But at the same time, I never leave the bedroom. The friends will never know im here. I just want to spend time with my boyfriend since I wont be allowed to live with him.

0,"AITA for informing a good friend that a girl he's started dating completely ghosted me out of the blue? | So my good friend Johnathon recently started seeing a girl named Tiara. I was happy for him at first, but I realized I had gone on a few dates with Tiara 5-6 months prior.

We went on 3 dates that I honestly thought went well. She seemed interesting and fun. After the third date she didn't respond to a single text I sent her. No explanation, nothing. Like I get that 3 dates isn't much... But to go full ghost after a seemingly normal date without any follow-up made me pretty upset. I even tried to recall if I had said or done anything to maybe warrant this, and I couldn't think of anything that would prompt this. I moved on and basically forgot  about the whole situation. 

My friend HATES ghosters with a passion. He thinks it's a terrible thing to do to someone and is probably one of the rudest things. 

When I found out it was the same girl, I told him like ""well maybe you'll have better luck than me, because she completely ghosted me after the 3rd date."" He asked if he could see the last few texts we sent and it was pretty obvious that she was ghosting. 

He spoke to her and said that he doesn't think they're compatible long term, etc. She kept prodding for an answer as to why and finally he told her that he really doesn't like ghosters and mentioned how he and I are friends. She didn't deny it - and basically said she was dating a few guys at the time and couldn't keep up with responding to all of them, and didn't really see me and her going past the 3rd date, so she decided to ignore me.

So... Lo and behold, Tiara texted me saying I was a piece of shit and that she really liked Johnathon. How I need to handle rejection better, etc etc. A few of my other friends are also saying that it was kind of a jerk move on my part. And that ghosting is no big deal.

Look, I get that rejection happens and I'm not really that upset over it. But the way it went down just felt sour to me, and I wanted my friend to know the type of person she is.

The main thing that they can be used for is internet surfing but even then they don't have much proccessing power to load modern websites which take so much power.

I made a reference to this in the description saying that people think they are bricks in 2020 but ive been using it for Spotify which is pre-downloaded. It's not like I'm selling a broken iPad. It can be used as a music hub or even something for a computer enthusiast to jailbreak or whatever they want.

The seller is requesting a return of the item based upon the fact that she can't run YouTube on safari and so they have decided it's broken. 

I have tried to explain that if they had done the slightest bit of research on google then they'd have found that they should be buying atleast the second generation iPad which still supports YouTube. I've also offered to send her links to the huge amount of videos on YouTube which go over what they can still be used for and what they can't be used for.

1,"AITA For telling my husband it's me or his games? | So for a few months now me and my husband have been having some trouble. He has become pretty distant from me and seems to give me less and less attention every day. The minute he gets home from work he hops onto his xbox or pc and just wants to play video games until he goes to sleep.

&#x200B;

This all started after he got a promotion at work and according to him it's upped his workload drastically and he just doesn't have any energy to do anything else after. Even on his days off he seems to just want to sit at home and game instead of doing anything with me or the kids. I've honestly been super stressed about this all and it's really taking a toll on me. 

&#x200B;

Last night I reached my breaking point. I wanted to go out for dinner with him when he got home and he said he was too tired. He got right onto his xbox and I pulled the plug on it and told him. He flipped and we started fighting. In the end I told him that either he gets rid of the games or I leave. He called me manipulative and unappreciative of him.  According to him, because i only work part time as a volunteer and have a nanny to help with the kids i have no idea what stress he is under. 

&#x200B;

I haven't spoken with him since and ended up sleeping on the couch last night. My nanny says she heard the conversation and says i'm the asshole. According to her I'm not being considerate of him but I don't agree. I think its wrong for him to sit there and play for hours and ignore me.

1,"AITA for getting my parents to threaten my school to allow me to take more APs? | I go to a private school that has some weird rules about AP classes— you can only take one as a freshman, 2 as a sophomore, etc. From people that I’ve talked to, this is different from a lot of schools. I want to take lots of AP classes, as many is as practical while maintaining other areas of my life, to get a good weighted gpa, get college credit, and look good to colleges.

I’m going into sophomore year, and I want to take 4 APs: physics, world history, US History, and Econ. I know I can handle them, because this year with the exception of physics, I have lots of prereq knowledge in all of them. My plan is basically getting tutors for all these subjects and spending varying amounts of time this summer learning as much as I can to prepare myself for next year.

Obviously, the school refused to let me take 4 APs, so I just asked my parents to have a talk with the administration. I’m 3rd generation at this school, and my parents make hefty donations, so their words have weight. They managed to convince the administration to let me take 4 APs. But the guidance counselor got really pissed off at me about it. 

It’s cool, cause he won’t be writing a rec letter (that’ll be the school’s college counselor), but I genuinely don’t think the anger is justified. I’m not hurting anyone by taking 4 APs, so there’s inherently nothing wrong with that action.

0,"WIBTA if I didn't let my downstairs neighbor in after he got locked out | I live in an apartment that is basically a house divided into 3 apartments, with only one main entrance that leads to the apartments. One of the guys who lives downstairs always forgets his keys when he leaves, like 3-4 times a week I get a call to come let him in. This isn't usually a big deal as I'm home a lot of the time, although sometimes I have had to leave where I was at to unlock the door, and sometimes he calls late at night. 

I also suspect that he is purposefully leaving the main door unlocked when he leaves, because many times when I leave that door is unlocked, and I always make sure to lock that door. 

Today I almost just ignored his call to teach him a lesson, but then I gave in about 5 minutes later. When I got outside he wasn't there waiting for me, no, he was trying to break the window into his apartment so he could get in(not the first time he's done this).

1,"WIBTA if I raised the fact that my mother only loaned me money for IVF rather than have it to me, even though she has more money than she could ever use in her lifetime? | Background; my father passed away unexpectedly in 2013 leaving my mother with a large inheritance. My mother and I are not super close, but she is very close to my sister.

My wife and I found out that we were unable to convince naturally so we went down the IVF route on the NHS (UK) it failed so we had to for further rounds. The cost was £13,000, we could have got a loan but we asked my mum for it and said we would pay her back, which we are doing at 200 a month, that way there is no interest. By no means would I ever stop.

Mum then proceeded to give myself and my wife a word document contract that was obviously written by my sister, it was all very eye rolling but I signed it to appease my mum.

Fast forward to today and we have a beautiful baby girl, but my mum keeps mentioning all the money her granddad gave her. I really do keep biting my tongue about this.

I won't go into specifics but the 13,000 is a drop in the ocean if what was left and I keep thinking if it was me in my mum's position I'd just give my kids the money no questions asked and probably rejig any inheritance in the future.

1,"AITA for quitting without warning? | I've been with this store for a few years but the GM and I have been butting heads because i insist on having a life outside of the store so i gave my notice about a week ago. I was supposed to come on at one pm today but I woke up this morning and I just didnt want to go in there. The thought of having to work another week in that shop was almost impossible.

The GM doesn't work today, today the opener was ""Julie"", who got in at 7am to open. She was supposed to get off at one and I was supposed to relieve her. However, I didnt show up. She and the GM have been blowing up my phone for the last hour and a half trying to find out where I am.

For what ots worth, I did send Julie and our GM a joint text letting them know I quit. Now Julie is blowing up my phone because now she's having to work until 8pm tonight. I dont think that the fact that my store has staffing issues, and that my manager hasn't hired anyone to help, is my fault.

They dont have to give me notice if they were to fire me. I do kind of feel bad for Julie but ultimately I'm the GM should be the one to blame.

0,"AITA for claiming all my overtime pay? | My girlfriend thinks its scummy that I will claim as little as 1 minute overtime on my 12 hour shifts. She says she will not input anything less than 10 minutes. The way I see it is that 1 minute is an easy 1 dollar, and all the commander has to do is click an approve button. Our employers wouldnt pay us 1 penny if we got injured, yet she feels ashamed for claiming the time that you worked.

My girlfriend thinks that claiming for such a small amount of time will cause management to dislike me, and thinks that its worth the small amount of loss of money in order to keep the respect with my coworkers.

1,"AITA for expecting a date or an apology? | My(34f) husband (37M) said he was going to take me on an incredible date to Chicago were we would stay over and see a show, a play and have a good meal. This was supposed to be my birthday gift.

The main show cancelled and so the date was cancelled. I thought he might get me flowers or take me to see a movie but nothing happened.

A month later we were sitting at the kitchen table and I told him that I was bothered that he made this big sweet promise and then didn't do anything at all for my birthday.

Right then and there he bought tickets to a different show on a weekday that I can't go to. So now we're having to give those tickets away.

I honestly didn't want a gift I had to ask for anyway.

We had a fight about it last night.

Now we're in this catch22 that sucks really bad. If he tries to make up for not keeping his word, it's because I asked him to do it which doesn't (in my book) count for as much. I was raised that having to asking for apologies, good deeds, and affection takes away from their meaning. OR, if he does nothing he's kind of not admitting that he fucked up.

From my perspective I just feel like shit about the whole thing. I don't want my husband to think it's okay to promise me things and not follow through, I feel taken for granted because I had to basically ask for an apology. Last night he did apologize. It still stings pretty bad that he hasn't actually DONE anything to show me he loves me and messed this one up.

I told him I'm just going to forget the whole thing happened and not equate his lack of gift or apology with him not caring for me because I know we both just want to move on and not be upset about this anymore.

0,"AITA for not sharing my tip money with the table at a drag show? | My friend and I went to a local drag show last night and knowing we were going, I made sure to stock up on ones and fives for the show. When we got to the venue, there were reserved tables for sitting and then open tables for standing. My friend and I showed up early, grabbed drinks and a 4-top table for standing towards the front. As it gets closer to the show and people fill in, we notice a group of 3 younger people (the venue was 21 and over so they were at least that, but barely) looking around for somewhere to park themselves for the night. We waved them over and offered to share the table. Right before the show is about to start, I pull out my tip money and discreetly lay it on the table so it’s easier to hand to the dolls. One of the ladies who joined us said “oohhh! I wish I had thought to grab cash before we came!” And they start discussing if there is an ATM near by, I check out of the conversation because it’s none of my business. The show starts, the queens are fantastic, everyone is generally having a great time. My friend and I are tipping and most of the room seems to have come prepared, everyone was throwing money which is always awesome. My friend leans in to me and says “Do you think we should give these girls some of our money to tip with? I feel bad that they don’t get to interact with these ladies”. Keep in mind, the queens were awesome. They made eye contact, they went out amongst the audience but yeah, there’s a nice little moment when give a tip. I just kind of laughed and told my friend “nah.. they knew where they were going, they should have come prepared!” After the show, we were saying goodbye in the parking lot and my friend said she felt bad... we should have shared with them. She said they looked super young, maybe they hadn’t been to a drag show and didn’t know the etiquette about tipping. Maybe they had enough money to get into the show but no extra.

0,"AITA for respectfully messaging my sister about her tirade in our family group text and about her wife asking to use my SSN? | On mobile. Formatting might be wrong but here goes. 

So my little sister N, lives in AZ with her wife M. 

M, texted me via N’s number last night asking me if she could have my SSN so her sister could get a job. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable and basically a no. 

Then in our family group chat, N texted saying how she was going to basically stop talking to us because we’re judgmental and always critical of her decisions. And that we basically don’t care about her. Previously she had texted about having a job interview and my little brother asked a question about the place she applied at. However, the text was jumbled and a lot of it didn’t make sense. In the past I have suspected that M was responding to some texts acting like she was N. The only reason why I suspect this is the word choice and some of the sentences being grammatically incorrect as far as word usage. M’s first language isn’t English. Hence why I suspected this. I figured it was M, some of the tirade due to the fact that I denied her request to use my SSN. 

I texted N saying how she always plays the victim and makes it seem like were mean to her and don’t care about her. When in reality, she will lash out at us. Mostly via texts with incorrect sentences and what appears to be broken English. I also said that she was wrongs for saying we don’t care when just under a year ago they were in Chicago and wouldn’t drive the 1.5 hrs to see us in Milwaukee because M said they didn’t have time. Same thing in AZ when we all lived there when she couldn’t come and visit. Cause M was busy. Though when she did come over M day outside in her car and would start honking after 5 mins of visiting us. I love my sister but sometimes her wife is just controlling and weird.

0,"AITA for telling my new roommates they can't get a dog |  

To preface this story I have another roommate (20 M) who has his own room. The couple live in the third bedroom. The first roommate and I have lived here for 2 years and I have a cat, which is an important part of this story.

So in May of this year our old roommate who living in room 3 decided he was moving out and so we asked around to our friends and a couple was interested in moving in. So we opened up our apartment to them.

I believe this was a mistake looking back.

That was in May, my other roommate moved out in June. The couple is currently living here, but still haven't gone and put their name on the lease. They completely rearranged the living area while I was gone one day, which is annoying but not overly terrible. And then today happened.

Some important backstory about my cat is that I rescued her from her previous owner where she was abused both by the other animals and the owner. So she's very skittish and doesn't trust a lot of people.

My roommates decided today that they are going to be getting a dog. I immediately told them that they can't get a dog because my cat freaks out any time she even smells a dog. This isn't the first time we've had a conversation about them getting a dog, so it wasn't a surprise to them that I was against it. At this point they got kind of mad and said it was unfair that I had a cat and they can't get a dog and that they had done us a favor by moving in. I quickly cleared up that they didn't do us any favors, they decided to move in to our empty room knowing that I already had an animal.

At this point I was pretty heated because they were painting me like the bad guy, so I just need to know reddit. Am I the Asshole?",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I told my cousin his kid can’t stay in our house? | My cousin (M27) recently moved in with my husband and I. 

We completely closed of the very large main bedroom and bathroom to create a flatlet for him that’s separate from the house with his own entrance so it’s basically two separate units of one house.  

Now my cousin has a 2 year old and he’s busy with a custody battle with his ex so he can get to spend more time with his son. I completely support this and really hopes he gets more time with his son. 

Yesterday my cousin came to ask me if it would be possible for my husband and I to convert our spare bedroom into a room for his son if and when he comes to visit over weekends. There is no access from my cousin’s room into our part of the house and he doesn’t have keys to come and go as he pleases. 

I understand that the court will be looking into his living situation to see if he has suitable space for his son to stay with him (and to be honest his current room and bathroom is more than big enough) but I’m not comfortable with letting his son sleep in our house if my cousin has no access to him and I’m not willing to take responsibility for his kid. 

The whole family is involved in this because that’s just the way my family is and everyone expects me to help out my cousin with his current custody situation to get him more time with his son.

1,"AITA for adopting a Pitbull when my boyfriend told me I couldn’t? | So I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years. And a few months ago we moved in together! I’m finally at a point in my life where I feel completely financially stable so I knew I could carry my own weight with paying rent and bills. 

And realizing I’m now financially stable I realized I’m also stable enough to finally get and afford my own dog. Before moving in I asked him if I could and he agreed. 

We also talked to his/(mine now) leasing office and they said they didn’t have weight or breed restrictions. I could afford the pet deposit and pet rent as well and got really excited.

My boyfriend and I talked further about it and he wanted to buy a certain breed of dog. I told him that I’ve always wanted to rescue though. He was pretty disappointed by this and told me he would prefer if it was just my dog if I adopted. Of course I understood and agreed. 

Last night I told him that I would be going today to adopt a dog and he said “ok, just please don’t get a pit bull.” I was pretty surprised he would say that and asked him why. He then listed off all the typical, awful and untrue stereotypes about pit bulls. 

I tried to convince him otherwise they are great dogs but he wasn’t having it and said again to please don’t get a pit. I gave up and told him I wouldn’t.

Today when I went to the shelter with my friends i looked and met a lot of dogs. Most were in fact pit bulls and I loved all of them. But one pit mix in particular really stole my heart. 

I ended up falling in love with the dog and actually crying because my BF told me I couldn’t get him. My friends immediately started trying to convince me to ignore him and get the dog. 

After a while at the shelter I ended up deciding to get the dog and bring him home and just let my bf meet him when he gets home.

Upon seeing the dog my boyfriend and I get into a screaming match about how i lied and don’t respect him and a bunch of other things. I apologized but told him I’d be keeping the dog. He stormed out and hasn’t been answer any of my texts.

I don’t pay them, because we’re all members of the family who need to do our job and contribute. 

They met some other kids who work at their family’s business and apparently those kids are making minimum wage, so now my kids are starting to demand I pay them. 

They do pretty minimal tasks, nothing difficult, stacking and sorting, logging things into a spreadsheet, light cleaning, answering the phone. 

They’re really pushing for me to pay them now and aren’t having nearly as much fun as we used to working together since they found out their friends are being paid. 

I feel bad that they’re not enjoying themselves as much anymore, but feel it’s absurd for me to be expected to pay them. They’re my kids and this is their family. Plus, I never want to reverse a parenting decision because “that’s how my friends do it at their house” it sets a bad precedent. 

But I’m starting to really get worried I’m being too stubborn now, because they do good work, and if their friends are getting paid times might have just changed since I was younger working at my family’s business. Am I the asshole for not paying them?",False,False

0,"AITA for telling my girlfriend she has to get rid of her dog? | Throwaway because I'm just a lurker with no intention of becoming a regular poster; just wanted some third-party opinions on this particular issue. 

A little backstory to set context:

About two years ago I started dating the woman I'm currently with. After casually dating for a couple months she ended up getting pregnant. We moved in together shortly after to save money in preparation for the baby. I already owned my home so we decided to move her and her dog into my house with my two dogs. 

Here's where the problem begins. She is a nurse working the night-shift. She felt guilty about crating her dog at night to train him properly and basically let him use the restroom wherever/whenever he wanted in her apartment. When she moved in I told her that I would be happy to train her dog as I did with my boys but that we had to start immediately as I did not want him ruining the house and I was acutely aware that we would have zero time/energy to devote to dog training once the baby was born. She agreed but immediately undermined any efforts I made to train him - she would let him out of the crate during his crate time, get upset at me for reprimanding him (spray bottle squirt, a stern NO, and/or a light tap on the nose), and eventually told me that she would just take care of training him. 

Fast forward to present day. Her dog is not trained at all. He growls at me, has bitten me on two occasions, consistently pees/poops under our bed, peed on our son's playpen a month ago and finally tonight shat in his room at the foot of his crib, waking him up and driving me to post this at 2 AM. I am genuinely worried about our son's health and safety at this point. Her dog is only 10 pounds so his bites didn't do much damage to me but he could absolutely hurt a 7 month old child. On top of that, he's peeing/pooping in areas that our son plays and sleeps. 

I have told her for the last 6 months or so, on a fairly regular basis, that we need to find a new home for him as I'm now completely unable to train him even if she would let me and I still wanted to - between taking care of the baby, my two dogs, the chaos of her night-shift schedule, and me hunting for a new job/getting my Master's & CPA I literally just don't have the ability to. When he woke the baby up tonight it was my final straw. I texted her that I would be bringing him to a no-kill shelter this weekend as she had not put any effort into finding him a new home on her own. She wrote back a few angry things and has now stopped talking to me. 

I absolutely love dogs and animals in general but I'm down to 5 hours of sleep on a good night. I didn't want it to come to this and attempted to get in front of the issue with her by training before the baby came but, as I said, she interceded. At this stage I'm worried that it's driving a wedge between she and I during a time that's already pretty stressful.

1,"AITA for refusing to stop using flushable wipes? | A few weeks ago I switched from regular toilet paper to flushable wipes. Overall, I’ve been very pleased with this change. It’s been a much more hygienic option when using the bathroom. Plus, now that everyone is freaking out and buying all the toilet paper (which is such a weird thing to hoard in a pandemic), it’s seemed like an even smarter move. 

Anyway, my mom and I try to get together about once a week for either lunch or dinner, since I’m terrible at keeping in contact otherwise (I’m aware I’m bad at communication. It’s just who I am. I rarely text or call anybody if I don’t have to). We were having our weekly lunch today and the topic of the toilet paper shortage comes up and I mention that it’s not a big deal for me because I’m using flushable wipes now. She stops and stares, mouth agape, for a solid five seconds, before yelling at me in the middle of a busy restaurant that I have to stop using those immediately and switch back to toilet paper. She claims they will clog my septic system (which is technically her septic system. I rent a house she owns from her).

I know that this is a possibility, but it doesn’t seem any more likely to clog the septic system than regular toilet paper. 

She straight up started crying in the middle of this restaurant because, in her mind, the septic system might as well already be done for. 

She told me I needed to move out if I was going to continue using the wipes. She even threatened to change the locks. She called me a few choice words, including a mooch (which is fair, given that I rarely call her). So when the check came, I snatched it from her hand and paid myself. That made her even more mad.

0,"WIBTA for refusing my roommate's gf to host dinner at our house? | So I (26F) live in a shared house with one guy roommate (21M) and another girl (23F). 

Guy roommate - D

His gf - L

So since its Easter break, D has left to go on a trip and my other roommate has left to go home. And I'm home alone for the next 2 ish weeks. 

D informed me he's given his keys to L, so she can check up on his cat and also feed his pet snake. Which I've no issue with as long as she can inform me when she's coming etc etc. 

I am good friends with them both and I'm quite close to L as well. 

I get repeated texts from L today asking when our cleaning lady is leaving so she can use D's room to study and check up on the pets etc. Then about an hour later she texts me, that she was supposed to meet a friend in the city for dinner, but since the weather is rubbish, she wants to know if she can have dinner with her friend at our house instead. She said she asked D's permission and he's okay with it. And now she's asking me. 

 Just to be clear, I'm not invited to this dinner, so I'll have to stay up in my room, while they wine and dine downstairs??

Just to make it clear, she lives about 10 minutes away from our house, in an apartment all by herself. Plus our cleaning lady just left so our house is pretty clean. Neither D nor his gf have a history of cleaning up after themselves (think unwashed dishes left soaking for a week until our cleaning lady comes back). 

I'm not okay with it since I know she wont take responsibility for the dishes she will use and they'll just lie in wait until the cleaning lady returns next week. And I end up living in a mess that's not my own.

I asked her if he was going to use the one in our master bathroom verses the one in the hallway closer to the kids rooms.

I don't believe in anything, 100% atheist. Personally I don't mind other people being religious, but baptisms on babies have always bothered the hell out of me, since it's not their own choice to become part of the church. Also I feel like an intruder every time I go intro a church.

I still want to be there on the day to celebrate the fact that the kid has been given a name, so I aired the thought for my family (not my sister) that I would skip the church-part and then arrive at the get-together/party later. My parents started a huge argument about it, they said that the party afterwards is directly linked to the baptism, and you can't do only the party.

0,"AITA for putting my ex in his place when it came to our sons HAIR..? | So my (18f) ex (19m) have a year old son “Santi”. Santi lives with me in another city and the last time my ex saw him was in December of last year. We get along fine and stopped our fights until last night. We argued about Santis hair. 

Santis hair is about two inches above his shoulders and covers his eyes just a little bit. When he plays outside I make sure to pin it up so I won’t block his vision and bump into things. I take really good care of his hair so it’s never been a problem. Ever since Santi evacuated the womb his hair was swirly he even had a cute superman swirl in front of his head. As it got longer the tips of his hair have been waving up too. At some point I thought about not cutting his hair to see what it would look like long and wavy. I thought about letting it grow out until he turns four then I’ll get his hair cut before he starts pre-school. 

Yesterday I was Video chatting my ex so he can talk to Santi and we were outside so his hair was up. He asked why his hair was like that so I responded that i didn’t want it to get in his way. He said why I just don’t cut it and I told him I don’t want to that I want to see it grow out a bit more so I can see what it’ll turn into since he’s small and who knows if he will want to willingly grow out his hair when he’s older. Ex said he didn’t like that and whenever he visits he’s going to shave his head. I told him I rather him not and if he wants his hair cut so bad then he can be the one to take Santi to a kid stylist once he turned four and other than that I don’t want him to do anything to his hair. He got angry for some reason and called me terrible because he’ll look like a girl and he’ll get bullied for it. I told him that if he was to be bullied by anything it’ll be his last name because kids are cruel. (He took his dads last name which is pronounced like a food think of something that goes with fries).  

Then I said “you had long hair as a kid why can’t Santi he won’t have it forever he’s going to get it cut the day he turns four”  he then called me an idiot and that he doesn’t care about what I say he’s going to cut it when he visits so I got mad and told him “maybe if you actually took care of him and payed for the things he needed then I’d let you cut his hair but you don’t so shut up.” He hung up and told me I was an AH and that he was trying to make money. I didn’t respond to him. Some of his friends messaged me saying what I did was fucked up because he was struggling and I know his situation so why would I say such a thing. I do feel bad now but I’m just wondering if I am a AH.

1,"AITA for asking my coworker out? | I (33m) am a lawyer in a smallish office, there are around 30 people including support staff. I have worked here for 8 years. The average age is probably 45 but there's a group around my age. 

Around 8 months ago, we hired a new paralegal L (f25) who I liked immediately. From how she acts I would not have guessed she was 25 or that this is her 1st full time office job.

L and I have a teasing/joking relationship. We will often stop by each other's offices to share a funny story or whatever. It seemed like flirting but I  wasn't sure. 

A few weeks ago our coworker's band had a show. L told me that she and some other coworkers were going and that I should come too. Turns out we're the only people from our office who went, so we hung out and talked the whole time. I tried a few flirty arm/shoulder touches which she seemed fine with. To say goodbye I gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek.

I thought about it all weekend and decided to ask L out. At work on Monday I asked L to come to my office. I told her that I value our working relationship and would never want to jeopardize that, but that I would love to see her more outside of work. L was visibly surprised and said that she would be happy to see me outside of work as a friend. I was obviously very embarrassed and changed the subject. I have not brought it up again.

However, L has been acting uncomfortable around me ever since. Where before she would come into my office to talk about a case, sit down, and hang out a bit, now she stands in the doorway and leaves as soon as possible. She has not initiated a social conversation or addressed me directly in a group setting. When I joined a conversation between L and a coworker, L moved to the other side of the coworker's desk. The other day she went into the lunchroom, saw only my stuff there, and left for 10 minutes until more people arrived (she doesn't know I saw that,  I was in the kitchen).

Clearly I made her uncomfortable by asking her out. I tried to do it as respectfully as I could, but AITA for asking her out in the first place?

TL;DR I asked out a coworker and now she's uncomfortable,  AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA For telling my mom she’s too old to wear something? | I (22F) recently ordered a romper online and I got it today. I tried it on and showed my parents. My mom (49F) immediately looked it up online. I left to go change and a few minutes later she came into my room to ask me what size I ordered so she can order one too. 

The conversation went roughly like this:
Me: I don’t really want you to match with me. 

Mom: I’m getting it in a different color and I won’t wear it on the same day as you. 

Me: Yea but why are you trying to dress like me that’s kind of weird

Mom: Are you calling me old?

Me: Well kinda I’m 22 and you’re about to be 50. Why are you trying to dress like me?

She just said fine and left. She went to tell my dad what happened and she sounded really upset so I texted her the size. She replied saying she’s not going to order it since she’s too old to wear things like that. 

Some info I think might be relevant: 
I don’t have the best relationship when it comes to her and clothing.
She ALWAYS has a comment about my size. I’m 5’4 and weigh 130. As a teenager she would always make comments about how she didn’t weigh X until she was 25 or whatever. If I buy a shirt in medium she brags that she wears a small, even though it obviously doesn’t fit her correctly. She is taller than me and weighs more than me but constantly gloats about buying smaller sized clothing than me. On top of all this, she recently had a boob job and lipo done. While she can do whatever she wants with her body, I think it’s unfair that she brags about being “smaller” than me when I’m just existing naturally. No matter what I buy the first thing she asks is the size, if it’s “too big” she says how she can fit into a smaller size.",False,False
0,"AITA For refusing to pay for my brother's 'girlfriends' Abortion? | My brother (21) has impregnated a girl (19) who he claims to have been a random hook up. The girl says she wants to have an abortion which he is Ok with. They're both university students and fully dependent on parents for finances. Given the stigma around pregnancy outside of marriage here (worse for the girl), they both can't tell their parents. My brother however confided in me and wants me to pay for the abortion. Abortion in my country is illegal except for one chain of hospitals, known worldwide for offering safe abortions, that has so far been given the licence for it. Otherwise, most abortions are done in unsafe backdoor clinics without proper equipment and supplies by ""crook"" clinical officers, nurses or medical students, and that is the route they have chosen to go. There are a lot of risks involved in this and some girls end up losing their lives or contracting infections.

Sometimes she asks for a hug in a middle of class (especially to me, cause I sit next to her) and I try to avoid them, I just high five her.

0,"AITA for not wanting my ex’s new girlfriend to watch our three year old? | So my ex (30M) and I (23F) separated quite some time ago. Since then we’ve been very back and forth on how we should continue from here, but we’ve always agreed that our respective partners should pretty much stay at arms length for the time being if we find ourselves in new relationships. 
We’ve since then both found partners we’re happy with, and taken on our first “serious” relationship since our separation. 
He’s been seeing her (18F) for a couple months officially and has always told me he has absolutely no intention of having our daughter around her, despite my being okay with it. Even saying he didn’t want her around and wasn’t very serious with the girl at all. 
Her and I came together kind of behind his back. She seems to be sweet and we have a good relationship, we’ve even had lunch several times. While getting to know her she’s shared with me that she’s essentially an party girl. That’s fine. I was also an 18 yo party girl when he met me five years ago. 
This does worry me though when I think about them getting serious, I am worried he will want her to give up her lifestyle and be more of the house-wife type (which is what he wanted me to be, ultimately being the reason behind our separation) and she’s mentioned she doesn’t really have any interest in that lifestyle. Either way, the girl hasn’t any experience with children whatsoever. 
So, with all that being said, suddenly her Facebook is flooded with pictures of my daughter? I guess this is fine. I’ve recently decided to let my daughter see more of my partner, sometimes having him over for dinner and small interactions so I try to keep an open mind about him doing the same though it does somewhat bother me seeing her all over my kid. That’s probably just my jealous streak talking, but I’m confused as to why he so adamantly went from never wanting the GF to have anything to do with the babe, to suddenly having them together ALL THE TIME. I mean I go over there every now and then and it’s just the three of them in the living room like they’re having “family time”. I don’t feel this is appropriate and I’ve expressed that. 

Today I get a call from my mom who’d stopped by school  to see the babe and..well, babe isn’t there. I call him to make sure that everything is okay and he has his girlfriend babysitting because “the baby didn’t want to get up for school this morning”. Wrong answer. 

I’m so fucking pissed. 

I wasn’t even working, why is his girlfriend watching the baby? She has no experience with children and we have agreed that pretty much no one is allowed to watch our baby that isn’t one of our parents/at least a parent themselves. 

I very curtly told him that I was not okay with that at all, he of course told me he “doesn’t see what the big deal is”. He never does. Please someone tell me I’m not crazy. I understand he is her parent too, but he hasn’t communicated ANYTHING with me regarding her when I’ve given him the decency of doing so on my end.",False,False
1,"AITA for being a ""picky eater"" during family dinners? | My sister had a ceremony tonight that my Mother, Father, Grandmother and I went to. We planned to eat afterwards. So we're driving, discussing where to go, making different suggestions, all of which I was fine with. But we just couldn't all agree on where to eat. Since it was her big night, my father decided to just let her pick, and she decided on this bar that I really dislike. I tried to convince her otherwise, but she was dead set on eating there. So we walk inside and take our orders. The atmosphere of the place was nice, but the menu was limited. I ended up getting wings and fries, and after eating a few of them I just couldn't eat any more. The sauce was bland, with low quality meat. Fries were dry and unappetizing.

So as it goes everyone asks each other how their food is, and that's when I tell them I don't like the wings. Since we were all driving together, I make the suggestion that I take the car for 5 minutes and run up the street to get take out to eat when I get home, then come back. I said this because it was 9:20 and all the good restaurants were about close at 10:00, so if I took the car now I'd still have time to get something to go and come back. If we waited until dinner was over the good places would already be closed. You can probably guess, this didn't go over well.

My sister is outraged, saying that it's insulting for me to not eat at her big dinner and rude to leave the restaurant, not to mention the fact that my father was now wasting money on food I wasn't going to eat. I explained that I'd gladly pay my Dad back for the food, and it's nothing personal against her. My Grandma tried to convince me to take it home and put a different sauce on it, but I tried to explain that I simply didn't want it. My father was equally annoyed, my mother mentioning to my grandma how much of a picky eater I am. 

It's something I get a lot of flak for from my friends and family and it's just untrue. I'm not picky about WHAT I eat, I love trying new foods, I'm picky about QUALITY. And quality isn't always synonymous with price. You could spend a lot of money on cheap food and get a great meal for $10. I'm not picky, I just have taste. Everyone does, and everyone's tastes are different. 

But anyways, I'm really conflicted about what I did. On one hand, I could have just eaten the food, said it was pretty good and went home as to not make a fuss. But I'm just not the type of person to tell white lies out of tact, and I want to tell someone my honest thoughts, good or bad. So you know when I like something, I really like it and I'm not just saying it.",False,False
0,"AITA for speaking a foreign language with my kids that upsets my wife because she can’t understand? | So we have 3 kids, 17, 15, and 10. I’m only a quarter Japanese but spent ~7 years in Japan when I was a teenager living with my parents there. I’m pretty fluent as my job requires a lot of Japanese as well. 

My wife doesn’t speak Japanese at all and only speaks English. A few years ago my oldest and second oldest wanted to learn Japanese in school which she initially encouraged. Recently they’ve gotten to the point where they can understand great but still struggle to have the confidence to speak out loud. So sometimes at home I’ll practice with them for short periods of time. Like “how was your day, what did you have for lunch, etc.” They’re not advanced enough to hold long deep convos. 

This has increasingly bothered my wife because she doesn’t understand and always assume we are talking about her (we’re not, it’s all very basic stuff). It has gotten to the point where she has instituted a house-wide ban on all Japanese because she thinks its exclusionary to her and our youngest and bad for family unity. Ive tried to calm her fears but I also don’t think having 5-10 minutes of Japanese conversation every day is bad for the whole family. She told me that in the US it’s universally rude to have conversations of any length that not everyone can understand. 

However when she’s not around I’ll still speak to my kids in Japanese now and then. Recently our youngest heard us speaking Japanese very briefly in the backyard and told mom. My wife came home that night apoplectic and threatened to cut off our kids tuition if they insist on disrupting our family harmony. Then we had a massive fight between the two of us where she accused me of betraying her and making her look like the bad guy in front of the kids. 

I feel completely torn, on one hand I did go behind her back to speak in Japanese to our kids, but on the other she was giving 0 wiggle room. But I’m not sure if I handled it poorly. AITA?",False,False
0,"WIBTA for turning down being a maid of honor and not attending my sister’s wedding? | Throwaway etc.

My sister and I have always had ups and downs in our relationship. We come from a narcissistic family and she’s always been my Narcmom’s golden child lap dog. This caused most of our issues as she they would gang up on me and treat me like shit. I moved to a different country 7 years ago and kind of gave up on trying to have a sister since her approach to communicating with me was quote “out of sight out of mind.”

Last year I moved back “home” and actually lived with my sister during a difficult time, and things were improving. I finally felt like I had a sister. Things were great until my mom pulled some of her classic shit and succeeded in putting my sister against me for nothing. The banned me from family holidays, the last ones I would be able to have with them before moving back abroad. I was so hurt. I haven’t talked to either of them since, until my sister invites me to be her bridesmaid at her upcoming wedding.

I was shocked and honestly touched until I realized that more than anything, this is a superficial invite so that she doesn’t look like that girl who’s sister isn’t at her wedding. She doesn’t want to “work” on our issues, and instead wants us to put the past behind us and move on. I’m not being petty- I’ve suffered so much abuse at her and my mom’s hands that “just moving on” is not an option. I’d love to have a real relationship with both of them, but they refuse to own any of their shit, or apologize to me. Like I said, it’s a superficial invite to make her look good, and I think that’s tacky and tone deaf.

Part of me doesn’t want to miss her wedding because I don’t want to regret not going in the future, and I don’t want to be the asshole sister that doesn’t come to her sisters wedding. But being her maid of honor means doting on her all day and ultimately putting on an embarrassing front for the duration of her festivities which I’m sure she’ll derive some sick pleasure from. I’d be on edge all day as not to slip up and offend her in ANY WAY. (she literally looks for things to be offended by, and I’m scared the slightest misstep and I’ll have “ruined her special day”.

I also live abroad on a tight budget, so I would have to take off work, pay for plane tickets and stay with my family who I cannot stand through all of this. I feel damned if I do and damned if I don’t.

Ride ends and I think everybody will get off and the kid in the wheel chair will get off last.  Not the case.  They were getting the kid in the wheel chair all strapped up and blocking the train exit.  I said “Vome on, let us off first!” and got death stares.

He was never married to his daughter's mom, but they have a civil relationship and have shared custody where he has his daughter M-W or M-Th, and her mom has her the rest of the week.

When my husband and I met I made it explicitly clear to him that I am not interested in having children or being a stepmother. We tried to keep things casual, but ended up falling in love and I honestly can't imagine life without him. We've gotten around this by me keeping my condo that I had when we met. When his daughter is over, I go stay at my condo. I'm an introvert and have a very time consuming hobbies, so this works well for us. I get a break for a few days a week (we still chat and text) and then spend the rest of the week in our home with him.

I am aware that this is unusual, so I don't talk about it much to people besides family, but as his daughter has gotten older, she's become curious about me. We've never met but she knows about me and has never seemed particularly interested in me and is happy to have her dad to herself, but now that she's asked some questions about me, her mom, who was previously thrilled about our arrangement, thinks that it's selfish and weird. I think her mom is being hypocritical; I think she was thrilled at first that I was being 'sent away' when their daughter was over, but now she's finding a new way to resent me when she realized we're all happy this way.

I apologized because I wanted to get to the actual crux of the issue but he stopped responding to me so now I don't know what it is I did wrong.

He sends out a copy of the new schedule over text message every Saturday night so about five hours after he stopped responding to me he sent a copy of the new schedule. He always includes ""please respond with receipt"" so that he knows I got the schedule.

I was just so angry that he isn't doing his job and being a good manager and guiding me through my mistake that I decided not to respond. He sent me about ten texts before yesterday was over asking if I'd gotten the schedule or not. I refused to respond. Yesterday was also my day off and I was under the impression that any employee is under no obligation to respond to work texts on their personal time as long as it's not in their contract to do so, they're on call, or emergency services personnel like cops and doctors and nurses.

1,"AITA for making my children (especially 15F) wear matching outfits? | So I have 3 girls, ages 10, 13, and 15. Growing up, my mom loved to dress me and my siblings in matching outfits for holidays--Christmas, Easter, and Fourth of July, mostly, but also the occasional corresponding mother-daughter outfits for every day. I think this is a cute tradition and I brought it to my own family when we had kids. I just want to clarify that I am not making my girls dress alike every day, or controlling their outfit choices on a regular basis. When they were younger I would frequently dress all 3 or just the younger 2 entirely alike, but I no longer do that and haven't in years. Now that they're older we do a ""color palette"" for Easter and Christmas, so we're all in outfits that coordinate but don't necessarily ""match"" since they are all different styles to suit each girl and myself and my husband. For the 4th I buy matching t-shirts, so it's true matching. 

The reason I'm wondering AITA is because over the past few years, my oldest has been very outspokenly against any matching at all. She grumbles every time we do it and this July we had a pretty bad fight about the t-shirt (she wore it for photos only). Yesterday we had a back to school barbecue with my family and some family friends, and the topic of what my daughter was going to wear to the first day of school came up. My sister made a comment about how I would probably make her match her sister's Disney shirt (the youngest has a disney shirt her grandma gave her and she was excited to wear it) and (since we were both not 100% sober) it turned into a long argument where her side boiled down to the idea that I'm a control freak and a terrible mother. Today my sister texted me to apologize, but she reiterated that I needed to step back on the outfit thing because my daughter clearly hates it and is too old for it. 

I feel like the amount of matching I have my family do (like 4 times a year) is pretty small, and that I have eased up on it appropriately as they've grown older. I do have a lot of control issues (which I am working on) but my oldest daughter and I generally have a good relationship, with the occasional teenage moment. I've asked her why she hates the matching, but she just says it's ""lame."" I don't think that's a very good argument, and overall I just think that sometimes teenagers hate things and are ""too cool for it all,"" which is a valid stage of her development but not proof that I'm hurting her or a reason to stop sometimes making her be ""lame"" for 2 hours when she's with her family. However, I'm here asking because I know myself, and I know that I can be too much and I think I need to get out of my own head and even out of the heads of people who know me to see if I'm being the asshole to my daughter.

But I want to take my sister in. We’re renting a 2 bedroom home so there’d be room for her. My girlfriend wanted 2 bedrooms so one could be her office since she works and is in school as well. 

We’ve been planning to move for about half a year now. Everything will be finalized Wednesday. 

But my girlfriend is stubborn on the idea that my sister can’t move in. I mean she has other places to go but I want her to be somewhere where she knows she’s welcome and can take some time to work out her problems. I do understand why my girlfriend doesn’t want her there though. She wants us to have our own space. My sister and her get along great but she said she has to draw the line somewhere. 

My sister asked us to pay off her debt for her eviction and my girlfriend didn’t agree. I most likely wouldn’t have agreed either but my girlfriend is just really stubborn on all of this. She wants it to be just us. I think she’s being kind of selfish

Yesterday we decided to hit up a popular bar/music venue to meet some people and hang out. I like to dress nicely. I wore a cropped sweater, a pencil skirt, some light makeup, heels, and jewelry. When she got to my house, she seemed annoyed with how I was dressed. She kept making sly comments. I offered to let her have a look in my closet if she wanted to change, and she didn’t. 

While we were at the bar, I thought everything was going great. We talked to a bunch of people. I introduced her to some guys. I thought we had a lot of fun.

The guys that I introduced to her wanted to talk to me instead. I was like, “if you’re so desperate and blaming me why don’t you fix yourself up some so you can talk to more guys. It’s not my fault that I’m attractive.” 

She thought that I was saying that she’s unattractive, but that’s not what I meant.

I have the master bedroom so unless im cooking I spend 90% of my time in my room. Our lease is about up and my roommates were talking about getting everything cleaned since we won't be renewing the lease . They had a carpet cleaner give us an estimate and to get everything cleaned to their recommendations would end up being $400. They asked me to pitch in and I said no . They argued that I live their too and its on the lease that the carpets need to be cleaned, and I said ""since I or anything I own has never shat on the carpet, why would I pay to clean it?"" One roommate agrees with me, the other two are standing their ground . In my mind, the carpet wouldn't need such deep cleaning if they either never had animals or bothered to train them to not use the carpet as a toilet. AITA?",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I tell my roommate she's not to have guests after 9 PM on weeknights? | The quick and simple of it is that we're new roommates, been splitting a house assigned by the school (we each have private room and bath, we share hte kitchen and living space; we did not pick each other) for two weeks thus far. Her friend, who lives in the same setup nearby, is over constantly. They wait until 9-10 PM to cook dinner and talk loudly throughout. The house is a square, there is no hallway, no way to get ""away"" from the kitchen noise. Kitchen and living room noise happens on the exact opposite side of the wall from my bed.

I sleep early to wake up and work out. (When I do so, I am hyper-aware of noise and light and try to sneak out since I know she's sleeping.) I've told her this, and asked her if she and her friend can strive to be quiet after 8 PM, since I usually go to bed around 8:45-9 PM. She says ""Yes, no problem"" but the next night they're slamming drawers in the kitchen at 10:45 PM again.

I've just checked my lease and *all* guests at any time are only allowed with permission of the other housemate and it explicitly says that sleep, privacy, and study time takes precedent over housemates having guests. I *could* simply tell her her friend is *never* welcome in the house, but I obviously don't want to be an unreasonable bitch about it. I would like to say 8 PM, but I'm pre-compromising and saying 9 PM to give her more time with her friend. (They could, of course, just hang out at the friend's house . . .)

1,"AITA for breaking my friend’s phone after he took nonconsensual video? | I met the love of my life. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I’m proposing in about a month. 

My friends and I are big fans of parties, they occasionally (read: all the time) feature excessive drinking and some illegal drug use. There’s always people putting moments from the parties on social media. 

My gf has a job where if she’s even seen *near* people who are using illegal drugs she could be fired for cause. She isn’t anti-drug or anything, she just likes her job. 

I had stopped attending these parties or throwing them myself out of respect for her situation. But knowing I now have long term plans with her and not wanting to isolate myself from my friends I tried to find a happy medium. 

I corralled my core group (7-10 guys I go back with) and said I wanted to throw a party but it would either have to be a completely sober activity or we’d have to have a party with a phone check. They voted and opted for phone check. 

Gf didn’t love this idea but I promised her she could trust my friends. 

Long story short the party is in full swing (I’m sober - important later) and I see one of the guys has a phone out. I tell him loud and clear to put it in the phone check like we’d agreed. My friends admonish him too since talked about this at length. 

Ten minutes later a friend clues me in that this guy is actively posting to his Snapchat story with gf clearly visible. 

I couldn’t believe someone I’ve known for so long who knows what this girl means to me would jeopardize her like that after I stuck my neck out saying he was trustworthy. I told him to leave. He made some disparaging comments about my being sober that night and how it reflected on my manhood. 

I dropped his phone in a pitcher of beer and sent him packing. 

He’s (understandably) irate at the damage his phone allegedly sustained. Usually I’d be on his side, but I feel like we’re even considering the risk he put my gf at after several clear warnings. 

I know the party was a bad idea and I have to re-evaluate my circle of friends — but aita over wrecking his phone specifically? 

*Tl;dr I had a party where guests agreed to not bring cameras or phones in. One of the guests ignored the agreement. I gave him a warning. He persisted. His actions put my girlfriend at risk.

1,"AITA for being home all day and refusing to cook for my mom? | I'm a female in my senior year of high school and I have a younger sister in grade 10. As most of you know, schools have been closed for a while now and won't reopen for at least another month. My dad gets to work from home, but my mom still has to go out to her office.

My school just started online teaching, and we've been getting a lot of assignments to complete. However, my mom expects us to make dinner basically every night because ""we're home all day"". That really annoyed me because yeah ""we're home all day"" but we have school work to do. I got upset and asked her why doesn't she cook, since she always finishes work at 5 pm and her office is like 6 minutes from home. Well, once she got home today and saw there was no dinner prepared, she got pissed and started screaming at me how she's so ashamed of us and how we're useless. When I explained how yes we're home all day but doesn't mean we have the whole day off, she got even more mad and said that it doesn't take that long to cook. I refuted by ""why don't you cook then?""

For more context, my mom is an awful cook. She literally puts no effort into learning or looking up recipes. My dad is an excellent cook. He's tried to teach her before, but she refuses to learn and complains. Before, he would cook for us almost every day, even if he came home late from work (he has a high demanding job so his hours range but he's home 6 pm the EARLIEST, sometimes as late as 9 or even 10 pm. + 30-40 minutes one way commuting). And what does he come home to? Either a low effort flavourless meal from my mom, or my mom sitting on her ass watching TV and asking him what's he's gonna make for dinner. So my dad is forced to make dinner at a late hour so he can eat. More recently, he would just eat fast-food before coming home because he doesn't expect dinner to be on the table. However, he asks if us girls are hungry and offers to cook something for us to eat because he's worried that our mom didn't make us a proper meal.

I'm a good cook too (self taught), and I try to help out if I don't have too much homework to do. I did a lot of the cooking during the first 3 weeks before online school started, as well as baking lots of treats like breads, cookies, meringues etc.

Also, my dad does practically all the chores in the house, while my mom spends all her time sitting on her ass watching TV.

But, like, I'm her brother. I feel like these are things family should know.

1,"AITA for telling my friend 15 years later that my son is his? | The title is just that.

I had a FWB relationship going on with my close male friend around 15 years ago. He was always very adamant about not wanting children, and told me that if I ever got pregnant I have to abort it because he wants his DNA to end with him or something like that. Basically, he’s anti-birth. Idk, it’s a him thing.

Well I got pregnant, and I wanted to have my child but I knew if I told him it was his that he would make me abort it and I just didn’t want to have that fight with him.

So I told him I got pregnant from a one night stand at a bar. He was skeptical at first but I managed to put up a convincing story.

I had my kid, life went on, I got married eventually and had two more children.

My friend single by choice and child free.

So long story short, my son is at that age where he wants to know more about his father. I sat down and had an honest conversation and told him it was my friend, who he has met multiple times before. He said he wanted to talk to my friend and that he wants my friend to know that he’s his son.

I decided that it’s all out of my control now, and agreed that he can talk to my friend.

Long story short again, my friend blew up on me. Went into almost a rage over the phone telling me I was an AH, that he can’t believe I’ve kept this from him for years on end. I did it for the sake of my child. I believe I have a choice in what I do with my body and my kid and I knew he would’ve forced me to abort my son. He told me the kid is not his child and that he wants nothing to do with me ever again.

0,"AITA for telling my girlfriend that she has gained weight | My girlfriend asked if she gained weight and I said yes, it looks like she has gained some weight. I thought it was really obvious because my gf gains weight mostly on the face and stomach area. GF has also complained about her clothes not fitting and becoming really tight. She mostly wears loose fitting dresses and oversized t shirts and leggings now. The rest of her clothes don't fit her anymore.  

She got pissed at me. I thought she was aware because she has complained to me about needing to stop eating junk food everyday and about her clothes not fitting. She weighed herself today and found out that she put on 10kg. She's really devastated about it. Is this cognitive dissonance or something? It seems like she's just realising that she did actually put on weight.

1,"AITA for describing one of the trainers as ""the hot one""? | My job has three trainers. One's a guy, one's a woman who is kind of cute and one's a woman who...well is pretty hot. So that's kind of become her nickname amongst some people there. She heard about it and from apparently doesn't mind/actually appreciates being called that, which might make sense since she's an about 35 year old single mother and ten years older than the other trainer (who I must emphasize is not ugly) so she likes being reminded of that.

Anyway I referred my friend who got hired and who tentatively starts in May if we reopen the office and no longer are working from home only. So he told me his tentative start time and class and trainer name.

So I was like ""oooh you got *her name*, the hot trainer!"" He was like ""what?"" and I explained the other woman is nice looking too but all the straight guys and lesbian/bi girls at the office agree she's one of the hottest women in the office (btw I am female and bi.)

Anyway I think he was a bit creeped out. He was like ""You refer to her that way? That's weird..."" and now seems to want to avoid discussing the new job at all even though he seemed excited about it.

1,"AITA for fostering a child against my daughter's and ex wife's wishes? | I'm a 52 year old male with a 23 year old daughter. Our relationship has always had its ups and downs. Mainly because I did not get to see her and speak to her for a big part of her childhood. I left to go back to my home country when she was 3 due to DV issues with her mom at the time. This is completely my fault. I was an asshole. I have since gotten therapy and am happily married.


We reconnected when she was 16 and we were pretty much two peas in a pot. We are very alike and she moved in with me and my wife. All was well, except that we'd have pretty heated fights once in a while. I never got violent with her but I'd scream and she'd scream and my wife (who is very calm) would be stuck in the middle.


My wife cannot have children, but our dream was always to adopt or foster. Finally we were at a point in our lives where we could afford to foster a teenager. But when I told my daughter, she got mad. She said that it was unfair that I would foster someone rather than pay her mom the 'child support' that I 'owed', which was never ordered by a judge as we never went to court.


It is true that I didn't pay any child support but she lived with us for two years and we got her a car, clothes, food etc and spoiled her to make up for it. She says that it's still unfair and that she is hurt that I will raise a child when I was never there for her.


My daughter moved out and went to live near her mom again. I called my ex-wife hoping for support. She called me an asshole and hung up on me? Again **she never asked me for a penny before**.


Am I really the asshole here?


TL;DR; I want to foster a child. My daughter and ex-wife are upset because they think that i 'owe' them.

1,"AITA? I don’t want to return the heirloom engagement ring that my ex-fiance’s late grandmother gave me. | I received two engagement rings when my ex-fiance Rob proposed to me: Ring R, a new ring which Rob designed and had a jeweler make, and Ring M, which belonged to his grandmother Oma. 

Ring R was the ring that Rob gave to me when he proposed. A few days after, Oma gave me Ring M. It’s her own engagement ring and she said meant to pass it down to the wife of her oldest grandchild, but since Oma never liked Rob’s older brothers’s ex-wife, she didn’t give her Ring M when they got married. Oma said she now wanted me to have her ring. 

I declined at first and told Oma that I’d already been given so much as I already have Ring R. I suggested giving Ring M to Rob's older brother Ric so he could pass it on to the future wife of his oldest son, but Oma reiterated that she wanted me to have Ring R because she said she knows I will take care of it. At that point Rob and I had been dating for seven years, his family treated me like their own and Oma was like my own grandmother. So I thanked her and accepted Ring M.

Rob and I were supposed to get married in June 2018, however Oma died that January. I didn’t want to deal with wedding preparations while we were mourning Oma’s passing, so I asked to push our wedding back to May 2019. The new date Rob and I chose would have been Oma’s 95th birthday.

Well, we never got there. In February Rob and I broke up, and it was not amicable. I immediately sent Ring R back but didn’t think of returning Ring M because I thought of it as a gift from Oma, not a gift from Rob. I didn’t hear anything about it for the next few months, but last week Rob called my mother and asked her to tell me to return Ring M. Rob said that Oma gave me the ring because she thought I was going to be his wife, and since we broke up, I should give the ring back. 

I don’t want to do it and I don’t think I should. I think that despite my lack of blood relation to Oma, she chose to gave me something that belongs to her, something that is hers to give away, and it’s not Rob’s to take back now that we’re done. If Ring M staying in the family was Oma’s priority, then she could have listened to my suggestion and given Ring M to Ric to save for his children, but she chose to give it to me. I intend to take care of it and treasure Oma's memory like she wanted, even though I am not going to be part of Rob's family.

0,"AITA for not telling my (ex)boyfriend that I can get overstimulated? | Hey hey, here I am once again here to ask someone to alleviate confusion.

This happened just before Christmas. I had been dating this guy for around 3 months. He invited me to this Christmas party and we went, with the goal of sleeping over. I drank a bit, we watched movies, a fun time all around until the alcohol started to wear off and I got particularly overstimulated.

When I get overstimulated, everything feels so much more there. Noise is much louder, my sense of touch is much more sensitive, and lights just become too much. It makes me anxious and irritable. Namely: not a good party mood. So I excuse myself to go read to cool off, telling my BF that I was feeling overstimulated and would go to calm down, but it does not work because everyone in the room is being too loud.

When it's finally time for us to sleep, I can't sleep in the room because everyone's breathing is still too loud. My boyfriend asks me what's wrong, and I tell him I got overstimulated and tried my best to explain it through tears. He told me ""Well, you do know this is your fault, right?""

""How is this my fault?""

""Well, you didn't tell me this would happen. I don't know how to help you. This could have all been avoided if you told me.""

 ""I think what would help me most is to drive home and sleep in my own bed.""

""No, you can't do that, then everyone will think you hate them and I'll be lonely. You made a mistake, now you have to deal with the consequences.""

Then we went to sleep. I felt like I wanted to be anywhere but there, but I stayed and tried to sleep. Didn't work too well. He was wondering why I wasn't as affectionate as I usually was. I told him that I was upset at him. He said ""I don't see what I did wrong, I just told you that it was your fault, which is true.""

But maybe I am wrong. I'm sort of questioning my own sanity. I am of the opinion that even if I did tell him, I still would have gotten overstimulated and that I do not have to tell a partner everything about my life so early on (I used to do this, it was an unhealthy behavior). His opinion is that it could have all been avoided of I told him about it, that just because I have mental health issues doesn't mean I'm without fault, and that he told me everything about himself because he really loved me.

0,"AITA for banning my friends “emotional support dog” from my house? | To start things off, I don’t think his emotional support dog is legit. I don’t know the process for getting one or what the requirements are so I could be wrong but from my understanding all he did was fill out a form online, print a certificate and bought a ESA vest from Amazon. He brings his dog with him everywhere but it’s not trained at all. It barks at people, pisses everywhere and barely listens to any command. When he brings it over his dog pisses on my floor even after being outside, gets slobber all over the floor after drinking, barks/lunges at the tv, barks when there’s a noise outside (I live in San Francisco, noise is non stop), he’s pooped a couple times but that’s a rare occurrence thankfully and when we order food he shares his food with the dog and gets crumbs all over. 

I tried to be understanding that he needs the dog but the more I’m around it the more I’m starting to think there’s no way this dog could be legitimately certified as a support animal. He claims his doctor certified he could get one and as I said I could be wrong since I don’t know the process for getting one or registering one but his dog is not behaved enough in my opinion. I told him we can hang out but he can’t bring that dog with him, I don’t care if it’s inside or left outside. Cars and people are constantly going by so the barking is very annoying. He got pissed off and pulled up something on his phone trying to say he’s allowed to bring the dog wherever he wants, it’s not safe for him to be without his dog and everything under the sun. I told him tough luck, that dog is not welcomed on my property under any circumstances. 

An hour later he sends me a picture of a letter supposedly from his doctor certifying he needs a support animal and outlining how support animals work. I said I don’t care what his doctor said or what the ESA website says, that dog is not coming in my house until he at the very least potty trains it. The last thing he sent is “I need time separated to comprehend what is transpired and be where I am appreciative and welcomed.” I think he’s being a drama queen about it because he wants sympathy but a mutual friend of ours thinks I’m being extreme and making whatever his problem is worse by “stripping him of his right” to have an emotional support animal. Am I an asshole or is his dog’s behavior not justified just because it’s an ESA?

She said she wanted what I had on, and I said that she'd have to pay me $5 to do it because it took a lot of time, plus it would be all my makeup since she doesn't have her own. (Normally I'd charge $20 for what she wanted done, so I was giving her a big discount). She agreed.

0,"AITA for telling the guy who rear-ended my wife that she was pregnant | Last Christmas my wife and I were to attend a party. We decided to drive separately as I had to help get things ready and she was going to meet me there when it started. The road leading to the building was a very busy two lane road where the speed limit was 40mph. To turn left into the parking lot other cars had to go around you.

This particular Friday night while cutting a ham I got a call from my wife saying ""I just got in a wreck outside, you have to hurry! It's bad! It's so bad!"" I immediately ran out of the building and saw the crunched Subaru she was driving and the Chevy Cruz that a business man was driving. The entire trunk of the outback was squished in half, the wheel wells were sticking out and neither back door could be open. The guy I suspect was texting and didn't see my wife waiting to turn left and drive straight into the car going 40mph+ totaling the car. Now neither my wife or I had been in a wreck before so there was quite a bit of adrenaline going through us. The man who rear-ended my wife was fairly nice and took responsibility saying that it was his fault and that he was sorry.

After taking pictures, pulling the car off to the side of the road, and calling the police we were asked if we wanted them to call an ambulance to make sure she was ok. Now I would have said yes no matter what to make sure my wife and unborn child were ok, but I would be lying if I said that I didn't want the guy that hit her to know that he just rear-ended a pregnant woman because he was texting and not paying attention.

Here's the simple version of the story, I went to a guy who prepares tax returns. He runs his own business and I've been going to him for years. Google and his voicemail indicated that his business hours were from 2pm - 6pm. I showed up at 5pm on a Sunday and his business was closed.  I then went next-door to the neighboring business and asked if anyone knew where he was. The lady there said he had something come up and left. I expressed frustration that he wasn't there and said ""this is no way to run a business"". She pointed out that I was one to talk, considering I was trying to file my taxes after the deadline. She also pointed out that I arrived in the last hour of a business being open. She revealed she was the businessman's aunt. We bickered and then she said coolly ""have a good day sir"".

The next day I tried to talk to my friend about it, and he smugly pointed out that this is a recurring issue with me.

0,"AITA I cancelled on a friend for a date | I met and dated this girl, Agatha, for a month, over a year ago. We weren't compatible, so we broke things off mutually, and remained close friends. She plays tennis, and I enjoy watching tennis, so she invites me to all of her competitions, and I try to attend to support her.

I met Betty two months ago, and I asked her out. We scheduled a date. Agatha then informed me of a competition on that date. It was too close to the day of the date to reschedule, and since it was a first date, I didn't want to scare off Betty, so I told Agatha I wouldn't be able to go.

Agatha naturally got angry, and then stopped replying to my messages. For the next two months, she completely ignored my attempts to apologize and make up for things. I wasn't pestering her every day- sending her a message or giving her a call maybe once a week, to see if she had forgiven me yet.

Yesterday, I got an invite to a party that she's hosting, to celebrate winning this huge award. It's clear that Agatha intentionally invited me. I took this to assume she's forgiven me, and is willing to make up with me at the party. I tried to call for clarification, but she's still not answering.

The problem is, Betty and I are still together, and going strong. I really, really like this girl, and see a future with her. I told her about the situation with Agatha, and she got very angry- not because Agatha is my ex, but because Agatha has been ignoring me for months, and just wants to 'pick up where we left off' as Betty put it. I don't agree. I think I did something wrong in my scheduling error, and Agatha took time to forgive me for that. Betty doesn't want me to go to the party, but I wanted to bring her with me so that she could meet Agatha. She's willing to come with me to support me, as she is very important to me and I very much want her to come but has made it very clear that she's not too comfortable with it. She told me that she'll go with me to the party if I go since I asked her, and if I decide to stay home, she'll stay with me- no matter what, we'll be together. :)

Final point: I think Agatha might still be interested in me, because I've had scheduling issues before, with my work, but the only time she's ever gotten angry about it is this time, and the only thing that makes it different is that this time it was a date that caused the issue.

Friends of the internet, am I the asshole here, or is Agatha the asshole, or is Betty the asshole, or are we all assholes?

1,"WIBTA to wait until I graduate before divorcing my husband (who's paying my tuition)? | Obvious throwaway for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

So my husband and I of 4 years are going through an extremely rough patch that I don't think will get better. We fight all the time and last year he developed a massive drinking problem, became emotionally abusive, so yeah...that took a huge toll on me. I wanted to leave right then and there but he begged me to give him a second chance. Since then we've gone through therapy but there are still a lot of things he refuses to change. I'm tired of going to therapy and waiting on him to recognize whats right and wrong. I feel myself checking out of the marriage but the one thing pulling me back is my grad school enrollment.

&#x200B;

I started a prestigious grad program last fall and I have one more year to go before graduating. I have very little savings and earned a tiny fraction of what my husband does before I quit for school. He is paying for 100% of my tuition (45k a year) and will continue to do so as long as we're married. I don't feel that much attachment to him anymore to be honest but I don't want to blow up our marriage right now. Obviously the most selfish reason is because I don't know how I'll get the money to pay for my second year.

&#x200B;

I asked some close girlfriends about this and they all think I should wait until I graduate before asking for divorce. They said he's been a total ass to me so this is a small bit of retribution, and that I deserve to get my degree at the very least. WIBTA if I actually did this?",False,False

Also, I really don't mind if any of my friends or coworkers who know my username but are unaware of the debate stumble across this.

I have a VERY unique last name and I am currently the ONLY living person with MY name. It's not uncommon for the majority of people to have no idea how to pronounce it. I can probably count on both my hands how many absolute strangers have pronounced it right the first time. I usually find it really funny when people try but now with my current position it's become a bit.... annoying and at times insulting. Some of the attempts sound ridiculous and some of my clients have started to turn it into a bit of a joke. My last name happens to have a very common curse word in it and many put a lot of emphasis on it. I just politely correct them and move on anymore. It used to be fun to joke around a bit with people about my last name but it just doesn't feel right anymore. I appreciate when someone does their best to pronounce it correctly; I just mostly have an issue when they emphasize the curse word and laugh at it when we're all trying to be professionals.

A little while ago, I received a call from a new client who butchered it so badly that I didn't realize that she was asking to speak with ME. I know she wasn't doing it on purpose;I wasn't upset with her. After the call I jokingly said out loud that maybe I should start putting how to pronounce my last name in my email's signature. Some of my coworkers think it's really funny and would avoid confusion so I should actually do it. Some think it may be a little rude but are unsure as to exactly why it would be.

1,"AITA For calling the cops on a group of kids smoking a joint in the parking lot | First off, I live in a state where marijuana is medically legal and decriminalized, so people thinks it’s okay just to light up all over the place. I own a small business that’s located in a plaza with a bunch of other small businesses, including a head shop. There are always stoners hanging around shopping at the head shop. A few days ago, a group of kids on vacation drove into our parking lot and were just hanging around, being stupid, taking videos of themselves dancing and climbing on the railing in front of my shop. I took a video of one girl twerking off the railing to send to the landlord because this behavior is unacceptable. That would have been fine but then I saw them all standing together and packing and smoking a joint in the middle of the parking lot! They hung around for a really long time, like 30 minutes, and I tried to call the owner of the head shop and let her know her customers were outside being very disrespectful. She didn’t answer me so I called the landlord and he told me to call the police, so I did. I am all for legalization but the kids looked really young, they could have been minors, and I don’t condone CHILDREN smoking. The police came, 3 cop cars pulled into the plaza, surrounded the kids, and lined them up for questioning. They were pretty scared but it was for their own good, maybe they will think twice before smoking a joint in front of my business again. Anyway, as far as I know, the kids didn’t even get a ticket and they shortly left. The problem is, the owner of the head shop thinks I’m a major asshole because I called the cops on these kids. She’s mad I brought this kind of negative attention to the plaza and harassed her customers. She thinks I should have asked the kids to leave myself before calling the cops. But I didn’t want to deal with them, and it’s my right to call the police if I want to. This has now created a huge problem between the head shop owner and me and I told the landlord as much. She might be looking for a new place of business, which I think is a HUGE overreaction. It wasn’t THAT big of a deal, I think she should just get over it and not condone CHILDREN smoking!!

1,"AITA for not wanting my wife on my insurance if we agreed to have separate finances? | We've been together for 7 years, married for 2 (I’m 27, she’s 26). I knew that finances are usually probably one of the biggest reasons that relationships fail, so during the engagement we made a point of it to iron out what our finances would look like under certain outcomes, our views on children more specifically than ""I don't want them"", what we would do financially if we both decided otherwise, etc.. It was good to have these things set out then, we both got lawyers and drafted a prenup, and I thought we were on good footing then. We agreed that we would have separate finances and contribute proportionally to joint expenses like utilities, mortgage, grocery bills, etc.. For small things like gym memberships, Netflix, cell phones, etc. we are on the same plan and pay proportionally, but we agreed that major financial things like cars, health insurance, and taxes would be separate.

That had worked for us for a year and a half, but our agreement is now dying a death by a thousand cuts. Firstly, we had agreed on a fixed payment responsibility, directly proportional to our own earnings, but she argued that we change it 8 months ago. When we were engaged we agreed our responsibilities were 70/30 (97k/45k) and would stay fixed to the proportion of our earnings. But she argued 8 months ago that even though our income is 72/28 (180k/70k) it hurts her a lot more than it does me to contribute, so it should be 80/20. This didn't matter much to me at the time, and it's technically true that paying bills doesn't hurt me as much relatively, but it's been the first step in a worrying trend. This year she argued that we should file our taxes jointly. I was pretty against this, as that was one of the things we explicitly agreed to do separately, but to her, it was impractical not to, since we would both be losing out on a modestly large amount with no “real benefits”. Even though I wasn't for it, it was hard to argue for losing out on the amount we lost be filing separately without any ""real benefit"", so I agreed to do our taxes that way this year.

And now it's health insurance, with a similar argument, basically. She has to drive “hours” to see “crappy specialists” that take the plan her employer provides while I don't have those problems, it would actually cost less to add her to my plan and have her pay the difference, etc.. Again, it's technically true that my health insurance is a lot better than her's and it wouldn't cost more than what we pay in total, but I feel like pretty soon we aren't even going to have separate finances. I'm having difficulty expressing my point to her since it's not necessarily practical, but I feel the principle is worth defending, even if it's not the path of least resistance. Of course, to her, it's silly to pay more because of ""my ego"", but I think it's worth having the discipline not to abandon an agreement the second it becomes slightly impractical.

0,"Aita for cancelling a blind date my daughter set me up on because the woman has 3 kids with 3 different men? | 
I’m in my 40s and have been divorced for a year and a half. I have 4 kids with my ex wife. My kids are 20, 17, 10, and 8. My daughter has lived with me since the divorce. She is the 20 year old. She works at a dog care place that is still open right now. 

My daughter has been telling me since the summer she thinks it’s time I started to date again. I was never really interested, but being stuck at home has made me reconsider. My daughter was telling me about her manager, who is close to my age and single. She has 3 kids and has been divorced as well. She showed me a picture and I thought she was very fine. I could tell she was in her early 40s but she was very petite for having 3 kids. 

My daughter said she would be able to set up a blind date sort of thing. Maybe a walk in the park or a picnic or something like that. I have been feeling adventurous so I told her to go ahead. 

The other day I was talking to my daughter about her as I was wondering what the situation was with her kids. Like if they all lived with her or whatever. Just for conversation. She told me how one of them lives with his dad and the other 2 live wirh her because their dadS (I noticed it was plural) aren’t really involved. So I ended up asking for clarification and my daughter told me that her oldest is with her ex husband and the other 2 are with 2 different men. 

I told my daughter well obviously I’m not going to go on the date anymore.  My daughter asked why and I told her that I just don’t like that situation and there’s too much going on for me to want to be involved. I figured it would be best to not go on the date because I knew I was not going to seriously date this woman because of that. My daughter started cussing at me calling me judgmental and asked why I wouldn’t even give her a shot. I explained that I didn’t want to lead her on considering I probably wouldn’t call her again. 

I than got yelled at for “slut shaming” I guess? I’m not quite sure what that is but apparently that’s what I was doing. She said I have more kids than she does, I explained that her mother and I were married for over 20 years. I don’t think it’s really the same.

1,"AITA for taking off my aggressive dog's muzzle in front of scared strangers? | The title already makes me sound like an asshole, but hear me out. I have a friend who has two Labs, and they're essentially the only animals my dog doesn't want to attack. He loves playing with them, so I often take him with me whenever I visit her. When I called her, she told me that they were still renovating her house, so workers were there. I put a muzzle on my dog, because he gets aggressive around strangers.

I was dropped off and I immediately noticed a drunk father-son duo outside my friend's house, working on her front porch. They also brought their Dachshund, who was quite the ""friendly"" dog. My German Shepherd immediately started to circle him once he was unleashed, but I redirected him to the backyard. Twenty minutes passed and my friend's dogs wanted exercise, so her and I took our dogs to the front of the house. 

When it noticed my dog, the Dachshund I mentioned before started to bark at him, jump on him, etc. and that *bothered* my dog so I nudged the Dachshund away for his own good. The man looks at me, ""Why did you push him away? He was just being friendly."" I explain to him that my dog wears a muzzle for a reason, and that he hasn't had good interactions with other dogs, especially small ones.

This guy just didn't get it, and neither did his son, who took my dog's aggression as a personal attack, ""That's not true. Your dog is fine around your friend's dogs. You pushed our dog away because it bothered you, not your pet."" The argument got more heated,	and as I continue saying that my German Shepherd is an aggressive dog, they begin to taunt me saying that if he was truly aggressive he'd be put down already.

During this whole thing my friend is trying to calm us down, but these guys pissed me off. I tell them, ""Fine, if you don't think he's aggressive, I'm gonna take his muzzle off."" They back off immediately, my friend's trying to grab me because that really was a dumb move and my family could've gotten sued, but I didn't care because my dog was leashed. I take his muzzle off, and my German Shepherd goes apeshit; barking, pulling on the leash, growling.

It felt like holding back a rhino. Their dog gets scared and runs off. They get scared and start cursing. My friend gets scared of my dog, and *I* get scared of my dog because he's larger than me, so at that point I thought if I intervened he would harm me (which wouldn't be his first time). My friend and I join forces and get him inside. The workers call her parents to complain about me. In front of them, her parents blow it off as me being a hormonal teenager, but in private they tell me how I was a jerk to do that, no matter how rude they were being.

1,"AITA for expecting my friends to pay for my birthday dinner? | Throwaway...

This year for my bday, I planned a group trip from LA to Las Vegas for the weekend. I invited 2 groups of friends and my little brother for a total of 12 people. The first group (A) are people that I went to college with so I'm very close with them. The second group (B) of friends are people that I met through my new job and at my church. I met them a couple of years after I moved so I'm a little less close with them. My little brother lives in the midwest but we are pretty close so he agreed to come for the weekend and hang out in vegas.

We agreed that we would split the cost of the airbnb and also the rental car for the people that needed a ride.

The first day goes well and everyone got along well. For the second and last day, we had a previously agreed on classic ""Vegas night out"" with a steakhouse dinner, gambling and a club. It was gonna be awesome.

Dinner time finally arrives and we get to the steakhouse. The service starts off a little slow and tbh, I was getting annoyed by the service. There were some gaps between courses but I got it since it was prime dinner time.

We eventually got our food and the meal was very good. We also got a free bday dessert which I shared with the group.

When dinner was winding down, the server handed me the check. I gave the check to my friend, Anna, from group B so she could charge the bill on her credit card and Venmo everyone's share before leaving. Sidenote: we usually do this versus throwing in our own credit cards so one person gets the credit card points. Also, everyone always pays their share through so we don't have a problem with people not paying.

Anna does the math and it's $83 a person. I asked Anna if she included or excluded me in the charge and she says she included me.

I then told Anna that usually when we do bday dinners with friend group A, we pay for the bday person. Anna seemed to be caught off-guard and awkward. She said she wouldn't charge me. Also, no one from friend group A decided to vouch or speak up.

After she said that, I insisted that she include me and that I just wanted to let her know since this is the first bday dinner we're celebrating together. In the end, she didn't include me in the charge and everyone ended up paying around $93, a $10 difference.

After dinner, I noticed that Anna and the rest of my church / work friends were being a bit aloof. I started feeling weird about it so I bought them drinks at the club ($100 dollars total for 5 drinks) and apologized for bringing up the paying for the birthday girl thing at dinner.

I'm starting a new job with Anna (she hired me as her replacement since she got promoted) and she will be training me for the next few weeks. Before I start a professional relationship with her, I just want to clear the air if there's an issue.

1,"AITA For Remodeling Apartment While Occupied by Tenant (who is now threatening legal action) | I'm a property manager in a college town. We’re the biggest rental company in town, so we deal with a lot of assholes and college students trashing our units. We told tenants in 2019 that we wanted to update/remodel their unit. We listed out things like the appliances, kitchen cabinets and flooring, and closet rods/curtains and sent a picture of what a new kitchen looks like. Tenants agreed and our construction workers went over to measure. We sent 3 large totes for kitchen and bathroom items.

Monday, I come into work to an angry email from one tenant saying that she didn’t know the full extent of what we were remodeling and that we couldn’t enter the bedrooms to replace the closet doors with curtains because her cats were in there and her roommate works at night and is trying to sleep or something. She said she didn’t know we were trying to do work in the bedrooms, which is ridiculous. We said we were replacing “closet rods and curtains”. I told her we wouldn’t do anything to the closets and next she’s pissed because the workers have gone into the bedrooms to replace light fixtures. The workers aren’t mind readers, so how are they supposed to know? I also told her she was already told to “kennel or board her pets” and she would need to send them to stay with a friend or be boarded. She sent a rude reply saying she thought putting them in the bedroom was kenneling them and that she would send them to be boarded if I would pay for it. She was also pissed because we were changing the shape of a wall downstairs because we hadn’t included every single detail of the remodel and then also that we were doing work upstairs because supposedly the workers said they weren’t going to be remodeling upstairs when they came to measure (which, yeah right, you didn’t listen correctly). She told us to put everything back and leave and I said no because we had already demolished everything.

Anyways, she basically went on to start demanding compensation in rent for the week because of all the remodel, but SHE AGREED TO IT. Not my fault. She was told that workers would be coming and going from 7:30 AM to 6 PM, Monday through Friday. My manager offered her 3.5 days of rent. She demanded a week, saying she was going to hire a lawyer. My manager asked her to come in person, but she said no because she wanted to keep everything between us in writing. I think she’s watched too many lawyer shows. 

We told her that we would have moved onto another unit if we had known how many concerns she was going to have. This is basically a brand new unit for only 5 days of construction. We’ve done more than 30 similar remodels in the last year and have never had any complaints or issues like this.

My wife won’t tell me what it is... she came home in tears that night. I asked her what happened, and she told me that he mother made her swear not to tell anyone.... My wife doesn’t hide anything from me.. she tells me everything. I just can’t imagine what this might be. She’s been crying about it for days... and she just says she can’t tell me... I asked her if if was something health related, and if someone is dying, and she told me no... I asked her if this secret is going to rip her family apart, and she said YES... But that’s all she will tell me.. I just can’t seem to figure it out... 

We usually take her mom and dad out to eat a few times a month.. Last week I asked if she wanted to invite her parents out to eat with us, and she said no. She told me some stuff went down, and that I won’t be seeing her parents for a good while. She told me that we won’t be going to visit them for a while (This is very strange because they are a very close family, and we visit them at least once per week. She says that I will not be able to visit them anymore, and that only she can go over there now) This is so strange, because they are such a close family, and not being able to visit anymore is just so strange. 

It hurts me that she can’t share something as serious as this with me. We are married, and big secrets like this should not exist. If it were the other way around, I would absolutely tell her whatever it was. She’s upset and saying that I’m making this about us, when it’s about her parents and her family. But we are married, I thought I was part of the family too now?? 

Am I the asshole here?",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I asked my Sister-In-Law not to bring her 7 year old son to Hawaii with us? | So last week my family and I all went on our annual trip to Oregon to fish, camp, and hang out. We have done this for a couple years and we usually have a good time.

For some quick background, my Sister-In-Law, (who I will call Hanna) has a husband (who is unimportant for this story) and they have two kids, Jane (older sister who is 13) and Harry (younger brother who is 7, and both parents baby the hell out of him). I have a similar family, but instead of 1 daughter and 1 son, I have 2 sons who are 10 and 15.

This year started mostly the same, and my Sister-in-law’s son has been there in years prior, but this year, Harry has been exponentially more annoying. My 2 sons complain that he asks them both for help with stupidly simple things (like turning on the greatest showman for him, which he watched 5-7 times while we were there) and asks them to ride bikes with him almost every hour (since Hanna doesn’t let Harry go by himself in the small RV park we stayed in.)

Hanna is overly tolerant for everything Harry does, but is very hard on Jane. Hanna is so tolerant, that I believe Harry will be dependent on his parents for longer than he should (and trust me, it’s not your average annoying 7 year old, it’s been 3 days since we got home and my kids are still mad at how annoying he was, and how he ruined the trip)

In 2021, both of our families are going to Hawaii, and I honestly don’t want Harry there. I think he would ruin the type of trip I want us to have, and I’m thinking about backing out of the trip all together to avoid wasting money on a ruined trip.

So, WIBTA if I asked Hanna not to bring Harry?",False,False
1,"AITA For not hating my family for being involved in organized crime. | Throwaway because i dont want hate.

Recently on this sub there was a post that is now locked about a poster who had a father in the mob who killed people. Like 99% of the comments buried the op and said that the dad was a pos who deserved to burn in hell. I couldnt comment because the thread was locked.

So my father is involved in organized crime, grandpa was/is ((retired)) involved in organized crime. So were my great uncles, and my uncle. I don't hate them, I don't think they're awful people. I love them. 

The way I see it they're no different from being in the military. They dont harm anyone who isn't also in a ""military"". My uncle actually was in the marines and described it like that. They aren't psychos or rapists.

1,"AITA for yelling at my roommate when she has to pee | Basically me and my roommate are typically night owls. We both are in college and live in a room together. On a school night we tend to go to bed around 12-1am give or take. We both spend plenty of time playing our respective video games before we both get ready for bed. 

My nighttime routine takes a lot longer than hers. She usually pees, brushes her teeth, and jumps in bed. I have to jerk off, take a 20 minute shower, brush my teeth, do my face skin care routine, and then promptly place my rump in my sheets and to sleep. 

The issue here, is we both get ready for bed at the same time. However, her cue to get ready for bed is me saying I have to go shower. As soon as I get up, she turns around, and BOOKS IT to the bathroom to piss. Keep in mind, she has to pee before she goes to bed. HOWEVER, I can’t STAND how she refuses to pee for HOURS on end and ONLY gets up as soon as I do. Granted this isn’t a massive issue, BUT ITS INCREDIBLY INCONVENIENT. I’ve told her multiple times to be a functioning adult and pee at normal times, but instead she is more reliable in getting to the bathroom before I can than she can get her work done in a RESPONSIBLE TIME FRAME FOR CLASS. Keep in mind she CAN pee whenever she wants to, she just always chooses to piss me off (see what I did there?) She insists she only gets up when I do because she gets distracted playing games and wants to empty her bladder in one fell swoop.

1,"AITA for not talking to my mother anymore after she didn't keep a secret I told her several years ago? | About three years ago I \[M30\] got together with my now fiance \[F28\]. We got to know each other online. She was from Germany and I'm from Canada. 

After chatting and flirting for 6 months, we decided to meet ""half way"" on neutral ground and flew to Paris. We had a beautiful weekend together and it was our personal secret. We instantly knew we would be a couple.

Fast forward 3 years. I live in Germany now. We are engaged, and we will marry in a month. Three weeks ago was my girlfriends bachelorette party and all of her friends and some family came to have a nice evening with her, including my sister.

My girlfriend came home crying that night. When she was asked what her most romantic moment with me was and she didn't tell anything about Paris, my sister just broke in with ""Wasn't the way you two met in Paris the most romantic thing for you?"".

My girlfriend was in shock and didn't know how to respond while being watched by all the other girls at the party.

To make it short: I only told my mother about Paris and my girlfriend only told her mother. We agreed on that. 

The day after the party I had a huge fight with my mother, where she insisted that we behave ""overly dramatic"" and that since it's a beautiful thing we two experienced together, we should celebrate it with our friends. ""This is something romantic not many people experience and you two can be happy to share that with your close friends and family"" is what my mother said. 

She insists we are overreacting. I apologized to my girlfriend for the behavior of my mother.  My sister felt awkward too since she apparently didn't even know this was supposed to be a secret.

I didn't talk to my mother since we had the fight and did not answer any message or call. I honestly don't know how this is going to work out at our wedding.

She apologized in the mean time but I do not want to talk to her right now, which now lead to my sister being somewhat mad at me for handling it that way since my mother ""didn't mean any bad"". Still: even after apologizing, my mother still thinks we are overreacting and she keeps telling me that. 

Am I the asshole for giving my mother a silent treatment after she didn't keep my secret?",False,False
0,"AITA if I kick my gf out after living together for less than two months? | Gf moved in in January.  We've been dating since August.  When we agreed to move in I was over the moon about it.  Due to work I didn't get to spend nearly enough time with her.  It was a huge mistake though.

She's always been this awesome mix of sweet and sarcasm.  One of the funniest persons I've ever met and humor is my favorite trait in a person so I fell hard fast.  She was living with her parents, but being 24 it was not ideal for her.  So we talked and I invited her to move in.

It was like a switch flipped.  Right at the beginning I noticed a change in her personality.  The sweet part of her just seemed to disappear.  It's been nothing, but negativity.  I enjoy sarcasm, but when it's constant with no break it gets wearing.  There's also a ridiculous amount of complaining.  It's like she's miserable 24/7.  I'm not over stating it, if there's a few minutes of silence she will break it with the most asinine complaining.  She's also become really mean spirited.  The way she talks about her ""friends"" behind their backs just makes me feel bad for them as well as makes me wonder how she talks about me behind my back.

I've tried talking to her about it a couple times, but it always ends in a fight.  The last time she kinda pouted and said that she just wouldn't talk at all then, and to be honest I wasn't mad at the prospect.   It didn't last very long though before she sarcastically asked me if she was allowed to talk yet.

She's just become such a pill to be around, it's draining.  I don't look forward to going home after work at all anymore, and I dread weekends.  I know if I tell her to pack up it's most likely the end of the relationship, but I honestly don't even know if that's a bad thing.  The only thing that's holding me back a little is that there's this shred of hope that the girl I fell so hard for is still in there and this is just some phase or something.  It's been less than two months, I haven't really given it a ton of time.  It just feels like it's been forever.",False,False
1,"AITA for not telling gf how I paid for dinner | Last week I organised a romantic dinner for me and my gf at a fine dining restaurant she's always wanted to go to. She was excited, the only problem was I hadn't worked out how we were going to pay for it. 

We have joint accounts, and budget our money together including some 'splurge' for each of us to spend how we want. The cost of the dinner was going to be more than what I could cover with my splurge alone, so I suggested we maybe go halves or something. This upset her because she believed as I was taking her to dinner I should pay. I didn't press the issue then because I didn't know what to do.

Later that day we were out having lunch. Knowing I wouldn't be able to use my splurge for the lunch and the dinner, I said ""if you pay for lunch, I'll sort out the dinner."" She agreed and we had lunch. I thought I'd pay for the dinner with the credit card and sort it out later.

Well looking at our budget later I realized that as I stroke of luck, due to the fact we pay our loans monthly and budget half the repayment every fortnight, there are actually 3 pays before the next loan repayment. Excellent, I can use some of that money to pay for the dinner. The rest can just go onto the loans as an extra payment.

We went to dinner a few days later, had a great time, all was good. Cut to the next day and I was browsing a shop on my phone and mentioned something about my splurge. 
""But you don't have any left""
""Yeah I do, because I actually found a way to cover the dinner"" I explained my budget magic.
""Oh so you make me spend MY splurge on lunch and then don't pay for dinner?""

Lunch cost $35, Dinner cost $250. There's no way my splurge could cover the dinner and she knew that. I'll admit I didn't think about offering to pay her back for my lunch, but it wasn't through any malice. (I have since put all my splurge back onto the credit card to cover most of the dinner payment). She got very angry at me for making her pay for the dinner without her consent, and is saying that I'm sneaky for getting a free lunch and not paying for her dinner etc. I don't think there's anything wrong with using our money to pay for our dinner, but believes now that the romantic dinner doesn't really count as me doing something nice for her because I paid for it out of our joint money. 

So AITA for using the extra loan payments?",False,False
0,"AITAH for pressing charges against my pregnant best friend? | I met my best friend in high school. She had this boyfriend who was bad for her and she never saw it. They were on and off for a few years. After we graduated, she moved in with him. She ended up getting pregnant and then moving to a different state. That didn’t work out, so they moved back here. I was still there for here, and was still her best friend through all of this. One day, we were hanging out, having a good time. We went to the mall, I bought us BOTH some lunch, and then we went back home. I told her I would be right back as I needed to use the bathroom. While I was in the bathroom, she stole my card out of my purse without me knowing. I came back, and she said she had to go. So I have her a hug, we said I love you, and she left. Later that night, I went to the store to buy some groceries. I went to pay, and my card was no where to be found. I thought I must have left it at home. I checked my account as soon as I got home and $300 was missing. There were charges from Victoria secret, target, and some other places I can’t remember. I was in shock, and so upset. I texted her, freaking out, and she said “I’m so sorry, I’m crying for you! Maybe you left it at the mall?” Which I knew I didn’t, because I bought lunch after we went there and I know I didn’t leave it. I told her that, and she said she was going to the mall to look for it. The next day, she told me that she went to the mall, and customer service had my card and gave it to her. (Which is obviously crazy, they wouldn’t just give someone a card?) I knew she was lying at this point and asked if she was the one who took it. She didn’t reply for hours and then left me a voicemail telling me she was the one who did it and she was so sorry. I was devastated, and I couldn’t believe it. I cried for hours, and after talking to my dad, I decided to call the cops on her. I don’t believe stealing from your best friend is something that should be allowed. Especially $300. I don’t believe in lying to cover up someone else’s illegal actions. It’s not right. She was 5 months pregnant at the time. She told me I was an awful person for pressing charges Bc she was pregnant and trying to get ready for a baby. And that we could have “worked it out.” I don’t feel like I was in the wrong there. We are no longer friends and don’t talk. WITAH?",False,False
0,"AITA for not being completely honest with my bf? | My bf has a band and I try to be supportive as possible. He usually will show me lyrics or play me stuff he's come up with so I can give him my opinion. So today, he starts playing me a part of a song he's written and the lyrics just sounded so cliche and corny and not great, but it wasn't enough to where I could flat out tell if he was just messing with me or not. I know how he writes and I know he writes so much better than that and I wanted to ask him if he was joking but I honestly couldn't tell. He's also been feeling very down lately, so I just said that it sounded really good so far and that I want to hear the final song when he's done with it. 

Then he's like, ""Well, I guess I can't trust you to be honest when I ask you for your opinion. You know that sounded like shit,"" and basically said he wrote it purposely bad to see if I would just compliment it/say I liked his stuff no matter what because he wanted me to give him objective opinions. I probably should have been completely honest, but it felt kind of vindictive for him to set me up like that. And he's still mad about it. AITA here?",False,False
0,"AITA for not interacting with my niece and nephew when I was forced to babysit them? | So I am 17M and my sister is 24, my sister was gonna go out with our mom for a mother/daughter date night thing.  The problem is that has 2 kids a 8yo boy and 6yo girl, they like me from the like 3-4 times I've seen them and I don't MIND looking after them for a little bit, but not for awhile.  Not cause I don't like them I feel uncomfortable with kids and like I'm gonna mess up somehow.  

My sister asked if I could look after them while she went on the date night thing, I told her that I wouldn't cause I don't feel comfortable doing that.  She told me to stop being so selfish and just do it and I put my foot down that I wouldn't, if she wanted I would help pay for a baby sitter.  

I thought thats what she was gonna do but when she showed up she just dropped her kids off on me and went out with mom.  I had NO clue what to do, I set up a board game for them and ordered a pizza, I was playing on my phone and they were playing a board game when my mom and sister walked in.

0,"AITA for being upset my partner's family Christmas is ""family only""? | So to give a bit of context here: I've been seeing my partner January of this year. We're both guys, I'm 22 and he's 24. We've lived together since August. 

I've spent Christmas alone for the past six years as my parents kicked me out when I came out to them at 16 and my entire family cut contact. My partner has the opposite relationship with his family. They're all super close and like to have big family gatherings on holidays and birthdays. I've met his parents and both of his sisters, as well his sisters' husbands and kids and got along well with all of them. 

Honestly, one of the things I was most looking forwards to being with him, especially living with him, was having someone to spend Christmas with. In the run up to December, I found myself actually getting super hyped to spend Chrsitmas with his family and actually have a bunch of people around on the day for the first time in so long.

That all kinda got squashed at the start of the month. His mum basically said that I wouldn't be able to spend Christmas with them because it's family only in their household, meaning only blood relatives and their spouses and kids. Since my boyfriend and I aren't married and haven't really been together that long, I'm not to go over for Christmas, though I'm welcome to spend New Year with them. 

Honestly? I'm fucking devastated. I'm not even expecting to get gifts or anything like that, I was just looking forwards to not being by myself on the day again. It caused a bit of a back and forth between one of his sisters and I. I didn't explicitly say anything to his family but I did ask if my partner wouldn't mind at least coming home after dinner and stuff instead of staying overnight like he usually would. I guess he passed it along cause she got mad at me for being entitled and trying to keep him from his family. He's now basically offering to not go at all, but I don't want that because I'd feel bad if he missed out on family time because of me. I'm still really really upset that I've been excluded and I've cried about it a couple of times. His sisters are now both not really speaking to me and it's causing tension for him in his family. I feel really really bad for causing all of this. Am I objectively an arsehole?",False,False
0,"AITA for getting upset with my niece for buying me lower quality souvenirs in order to save and pocket money? | My family and I are currently all on a trip for fun vacation purposes. Unfortunately, I (24 F) have issues with my legs, and sometimes it gets difficult for me to walk. I know I have to go to the doctors for this, so I will deal with it when I am chilling and back home.

Anyways, yesterday was our last full day of our trip. My legs were starting to hurt and I still wanted to pick up some souvenirs for some coworkers, so I asked my niece (15 F) to pick me up some souvenirs (they were already planning on going last minute souvenir shopping), and gave her the cash to buy them. I think my mistake here was telling her that she could keep the change.

I told her that I needed a specific keychain, a specific tee shirt, and a specific type of picture frame. She knew what I was talking about because we have talked about these specific items while shopping for souvenirs in the past.

The keychain was about $5, the tee shirt was about $15, and the frame was about $12 (I could kind of remember the prices). So I sent my niece with $40 so she would be able to cover it, with taxes and errors and all. 

When she comes back, I notice that she got me items that were slightly different from what I asked for. I didn’t get upset because beggars can’t be choosers right? She did me a favor so I wasn’t going to be too upset about it. When I looked closely, I noticed that she picked up very cheap versions of the items that I requested. The keychain was $2, the shirt was $6, and the frame was $7. Doing the math as I’m typing this, the change she would have pocketed from what I requested would have been about $8. The change she pocketed from getting me cheaper items was about $25. I’d also like to point out the fact that I knew that they went to the store where I requested my 2 of my original items because one of my family members was carrying a bag from that shop.

I asked my niece if they were sold out of what I asked for, and she said no, but she found similar items that were cheaper at another store. I clarified with her that she was able to buy the specific items I requested with the money I sent her with, and she said yes. I said something along the lines of “well was it really your call to get me something cheaper with my own money?”. She admitted that she just wanted to pocket a little bit extra and I dropped it because I didn’t want to start family drama, but I was a little disappointed because I had to give cheaper souvenirs to some people, which I’m not sure if they would notice, but still.

1,"AITA for going past the receptionist to get my package | I am a 21 yo student in the US. A while back, I ordered a textbook, and it arrived Saturday, 8/3/19. Per an assignment, the book had to be read by 8/7/19. 

In the community where I live, there are 2 offices:

1.  The leasing office, which is for people looking to rent a place. This office is open 7 days a week from 8am to 5pm.
2. The residents office, which is for submitting maintenance requests, paying rent, and most relevant, picking up packages, which are left by delivery people. This office is only open Monday-Friday 8am to 5pm. 

These two offices are in the same building, and in adjacent rooms. That is, to get from one office to the other, one needs only go through a doorway (not an actual door). There are two entrances into the building, one for each office. The usual protocol for getting a package, which was explained when I moved in, is to go to the residents office, show your ID, and the receptionist walks over to a small shelf to retrieve your package.  

On Saturday 8/3/19, I got the notification that my package had arrived and went to the leasing office to pick it up, as the resident's office was closed. 

Me: Can I have my package, which arrived today?

R: I'm sorry, but you can only pick up packages from the resident's office on weekdays.

Me: I know, but it has a book I really need for school, and it's right there. (Again, the rooms are adjacent, and the receptionist wouldn't be inconvenienced by having get a key to unlock a door or anything)

R: I'm sorry sir, that's the policy.

Me: I know, but I have my ID, I just need my package.

R: There's nothing I can do, it's the policy.

Me: Why is that the policy?

R: I don't know, sir, I just can't get any packages that are in the resident's office.

Me: Fine, then I'll get it myself. 

From here on, I walk through the door, find my package on the shelf, clearly labelled with my name, take it, and leave. To her credit, the receptionist was polite and did not try to escalate the situation. She told me that I'd be hearing from management, and sure enough I got an email asking to see me. I went to the meeting and they essentially reprimanded me for going into the other office unauthorized. I explained the situation and they basically told me not to do it again, or they'd call the police for trespassing. I told them to get rid of the unnecessary rule that you can't pick up packages on the weekend. Even though there aren't any repercussions, the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth, and I want to know, AITA?

My friends and I wanted to go hang out and generally when we do we always get lunch/dinner. This time they wanted to go to a restaurant I generally hate and so I didn't want to eat there. I told them that we can all just get what we want and meet at this one restaurant where they don't care what you bring in (I would get my food from there) but the restaurant they wanna go to doesn't allow that. Generally, they'd all be ok with this but this time they seriously wanted to go to the one I didn't wanna go to. This seriously made me upset since there is such a simple compromise we could do but I feel they're just being stubborn. Their argument is that when they get takeout from where they want food it generally tastes bad which is fair, however, I told them I would wait with them to get their food fresh and then we could go to the place where we could meet (since where they wanna go it takes longer) They still didn't go for it and so I just didn't go since I knew the whole time we'd either be arguing about it or they would be super annoying and bring it up all the time.

At this point my wife is insisting I go and scare this monkey off to get her purse back. Me, unwilling to get my face clawed off for a fucking purse, refuse to do so. So we keep our distance from this monkey as he's rummaging through her purse and throwing shit everywhere. Eventually he runs up a tree with her purse.

I bought a root beer on the way home from my pet grooming job and it was a fancy one in those kind of old timey wimey glass bottles. I left it in the fridge and went upstairs to shower. 

When I came back down I said hi to everyone and pulled the soda out to drink. I took the cap off and my mom said I’m not allowed to drink it because I hadn’t had dinner yet. I wasn’t hungry, and I honest to god hate sitting with them and eating while they make out in front of me and he touches her tits up, it’s just gross. 

I told her I would drink my soda and also have dinner but she said no. I’m not letting you drink soda in my house, you don’t eat, etc etc. My stepdad laughed and said here I’ll help you out and drink your soda for you. He went to grab it so I walked straight to the sink and poured it all down.

1,"AITA for not telling my sister about my winnings? | To preface; I won just under £3 million on the lottery over two months ago. The NL have been extremely helpful and supportive and gave me lots of financial advice and I've taken it all on board. While I chose to remain anonymous, I did tell my little sister about the winnings, pretty much the second the money hit my account. I still haven't told my mum, I know for sure she would tell everyone she has ever met that I won the lottery and that is absolutely not what I want.  


Me, my sister and mum all live in a small house owned by my older sister, we all used to live here together for many years until my sister bought a house with her partner. We pay her rent, a very small amount and we pay our own utilities. My sister has always hoped she can eventually sell this house to us but neither me nor my little sister have ever had the money. My little sister has a secure job but not very high paying and I am a casual worker so getting a mortgage would be hard for me. After winning, I decided to look for houses that we could move into, ideally one with a large kitchen and garden for my mum and finally found an amazing place not far from where we live and put in an offer that was accepted. Yesterday, I finally developed the nerve to tell my older sister (I was afraid if I told her earlier she would tell her partner, which I really didn't want) about the money and that we're buying a house and she can sell off this house now if she wants. She went apoplectic. I have never seen her so angry in my whole life. I genuinely thought she would be happy that we're finally stable but she kept screaming at me about why I left it so long to tell her about the money. She eventually stormed out and has been sending me texts about how disappointed she is in me and why I would tell my little sister over her.   


I love my sister but our relationship can be strained. Sometimes it would feel like we should be more grateful to her since she owns our home and we pay very little in rent and she has said to my face that she does so much for our family and we should show a little gratitude. She also does not get along with my little sister which further complicates things.

Long story short my aunt,uncle, and cousin lost their house to a fire and moved in with me for a while.  My aunt accused me of snooping in her things when all I did was accidentally knock it over and tried telling me I couldn't go into the basement of my home, so I told her it was my house and I could go in the basement if I wanted and if she doesn't like it then leave.  Now to the problem at hand. My aunt and uncle are getting evicted from there place because 1 it's very dirty, 2 the smell is just horrible they don't clean the litter boxs,my aunt smokes at least 2 packs a day, and the list goes on.  They called me earlier and asked me if they can move in with me and I said no.  My wife is 2 months pregnant and I'm ahasmaic so neither of us should be around smoke.  And I forgot to mention my aunt smoked in my house after I asked her to the first time she was with me.  I told her no because of how she treated me before and thought she could do whatever she wanted to.  My aunt called me an ungrateful spoiled brat and said I had to let them stay or they would be homeless.  I snapped and told her that it's not my problem you smoke like a pig or the fact you can't get your fucking lazy ass up to clean the litter boxes or even clean the house.

0,"AITA/WIBTA for helping friend get his laptop back from a thief |  My mate's laptop bag (with the laptop inside) got stolen from his locker while he was swimming, he reported it to the police who said they'd look into it but nothing came of it. Three weeks later he finds it on FB Marketplace, knows it's his because it has a distinct scratch mark on the back or formatted it as it was still on the same lock screen. Saw a chance to get it back so he had me message them and arrange a collection somewhere local.

On the day we pick up it's by the shops, he's sat on a bench with my mate's bag that obviously has the laptop in it. While he's talking to me my mate comes up from behind and grabs the bag, begins to walk off - thief tries to get up until I push back against him to sit him back down and tell him we know where he got it and he'd best stay where he was unless he didn't mind getting bummed in prison. He was quite scared of me when he realised what was happening, looked like he was barely out of school/college so maybe not even 18. 

Anyway, got home and when we opened the bag we've found that the idiot left some personal belongings in it, their wallet, a phone and some keys. We actually have their address now because of it and my mate and I have been debating over what to do with the things.

0,"AITA for siding with my daughter over my husband? |  My daughter’s father and I weren’t even together when I got pregnant. We chose to co parent and move forward as friends. When our daughter was 3, he got married to his now wife and she has been a tremendous step mom to my daughter over the past 24 years. They are super close and I love her step mom.

I didn’t get married until my daughter was 16. She likes my husband but they were never really close as during that time, she was busy with sports, school, boys, teenager things. They get along great, but obviously it’s a different bond than her and her step mom who has helped her father and I raise her.

Anyway, now my daughter (27) is getting married. She’s having her dad walk her down the aisle , and has given me and her step mom special roles in the ceremony. She plans on putting my husband in the list of important people in her life in the guide for the wedding, but didn’t give him a role for the ceremony. This has upset my husband. He feels like everyone else gets a role but him.

My daughter explained to me while she liked him, she wants the ceremony to be about the people who raised her. They have no close bond. So, I agreed with her and told my husband that while I emphasized with him, it’s her day. She gets the final say. He then complained that his daughters (25 and 23) were also not in the wedding (they’re invited but like him don’t have a role) but my daughter’s half sisters and step-brother are. I said that she grew up with them, they’re close. My step daughters don’t even care, it’s him pitching the fit. I told him that I would side with my daughter as it’s her day. He said I’m his wife, my “loyalty should be with him”.

0,"WIBTA if I did not call my friend by his proper name? | So a friend of mine, we'll call him ""Tim"" wants to be addressed by  the name ""Thor"". Ok, so let me start off with a little context, Tim and I have been friends for about 10 years, I met him first year of high school and we've been good friends since. The best way i could describe him in one sentence is that hes a hot-headed short fuse kinda guy, so being his friend was a tad difficult.

After high school we started to hang out less due to college/work etc, but we still keep in touch here and there. We were both born and raised in Canada. Tim is Icelandic, Thor is his Icelandic name, apparently Icelandic people have an Icelandic name in addition to their Canadian birth name. In the past he didn't mind people calling him Tim, but always preferred Thor. I recently heard from my circle of friends that he is now demanding people call him Thor, if people don't then he is cutting ties with them as friends. (He doesn't put enough value in long term friendships imo) I haven't spoken to him about this yet but we have a get-together in a few weeks so i will see him then. 

Just to be clear I WILL eventually be addressing him by Thor once I get used to it. My issue is that I've been calling him Tim for 10 years, and I'm just not used to calling him Thor yet. Whats most likely going to happen is something like this: ""Hey Tim! err.. I mean Thor."" Knowing his short fuse he wont like this. Am i the asshole here?",False,False

I have an older 50+ coworker who is just now entering my field, i am in my 20s. I work at a higher pace than him, while im also responsible for training and evaluating him.

In general hes a good guy but hes clumsy as all hell. Tripping, bumping into desks and people, dropping things. I think its a combination of stress at learning something new and being just an older clumsy guy not used to faster office environments.

I tell him multiple times to calm down and move deliberately as he walks around, but he hasnt improved much. Regardless i was going to give him a good review and pass him until this happened.

Im sitting at my desk typing away at my work laptop when he walks up and leans on a near by cabinet. He places his coffee on said cabinet. When he suddenly jerks his body and said cabinet shakes and his coffee falls on my laptop busting it up and covering it in coffee. It wont turn on now and corporate has to give me a new one. Most of my work info is on a cloud so most wont be lost thankfully. Ill have to reconfigure a new one, and by new its probably going to an old used one nobody uses anymore.

But my papers on the desk were ruined and i was mad about the whole thing even though he profusely apologized.

I gave him a terrible review and hes going to have to be retrained somewhere else.

1,"AITA for telling my SIL that she is not the real mom of our nephews and niece and should respect that our siblings would NOT want them homeschooled? | I lost my brother and SIL about a year ago now. My SIL’s sister was their godmother, so she has full legal custody of our three nephews and niece. The oldest is four. 

My brother and SIL were against homeschooling in any form. I’m fairly certain they were actually part of a group advocating for it to be made illegal. Apparently, however, my SIL’s sister, I’ll call her Cora, is completely the opposite. She has “always planned to homeschool [her] children, and that won’t change now, especially given how bad the local schools are.”

Cora has a degree in classical studies and history. She’s working on getting a teaching license now. She should have it by the end of June, she says, which means she’ll have it in time for the oldest to start Kindergarten. She also says that it makes what she’s doing more like private tutoring, but my brother and SIL were against that as firmly as they were traditional homeschooling. 

Side note: Yes, Cora works. She does something from home. I’m really not sure of the details. 

I tried to talk to Cora and explain that, when she had a kids, she can raise them how she wishes. She shot back that they are her children now, and she has to do what she feels is best, and a school with asbestos in the ceiling is a non-option if there ever was one. We argued more. 

I got a call from my mom this morning telling me to make other arrangements for Thanksgiving. Apparently, Cora had called to apologize that she and the kids wouldn’t be coming this year as planned because she “wanted to let things cool off between us.” Mom refused to miss seeing her grandbabies on Thanksgiving, so “since [I] made this mess,” I’m  the one who gets left out

1,"AITA for confronting my neighbour for regularly loudly farting in his backgarden mere feet from myself and my family | We (me M46 my partner F44 and our three kids who's ages range from 4y to 10y) live in a semi-detached house meaning our neighbours house is joined onto ours with nobody on either side. Our neighbours are a couple in their mid 30's with a couple of boys who are approx early teens. We havent had too much to do with them since moving in but have always been on nodding terms with the odd brief chat here and there. They have always seemed like nice enough people (up until recently). 

Our (small) gardens are obviously directly adjacent with a 6 ft high panelled fence in between meaning we cant see into each others gardens. In the past we have tended to use our respective gardens at different times due to work etc. Recently we have all been off work and spending a lot more time in the garden. Over the past few weeks it has become apparent that the dad of the family has a penchant for loudly farting at random times when they are all in the garden to the obvious amusement of his wife and kids. At first i thought that they maybe didn't realise we were outside so just let rip but recently we have been in the garden chatting at a reasonable volume so they obviously must realise we are there. He has started doing this A LOT with no obvious signs of embarrassment from him or his partner. It has really started to really get to us.

 Things came to a head recently when we were having our dinner outside on a nice evening and the meal was punctuated by a series of obnoxious rattling farts from next door to raucous laughter from his kids. As far as i was concerned this had gone on long enough so later that evening (once i had calmed down a bit) i went next door to have a word with him about it. I tried to be as calm and as pleasant about it as possible. He just refused to acknowledging that this was an issue stating that he had the right to behave how he liked in his own back garden and i should just mind my own damn business. The conversation ended by him slamming the door in my face. 

Since this happened things have gone downhill a bit between us. There has been no more farting but things have been pretty frosty when passing on the driveway. No friendly waves or words exchanged, just them avoiding eye contact with us. The last thing i wanted was to fall out with anyone but i just couldn't tolerate the situation any longer without saying something. I have recieved mixed opinions from relatives and friends.  Some think i was justified for addressing this while a few are of the opinion that im the asshole for starting something and should have just left it.

0,"AITA? I hate my engagement ring | My boyfriend of 3 years and I just got engaged. I am very excited to marry him, but there's one issue...my fiance picked out the engagement ring without any input from me and it is pretty much the opposite of my taste. When we discussed engagement/marriage about six months ago, I let him know that I really liked the traditional round solitaire in diamond or moissanite on a yellow gold band, and I said do not feel the need to go over 1.5k. I know that's very specific and doesn't leave much wiggle room, but I am picky about jewelry and know what I like and what I don't.

The ring he ended up picking out when he decided to propose is very different. It's a 3-stone emerald-cut ring on a silver-colored band. It's HUGE and very chunky and...not me. And he spent 8k on it, which while it won't put us in financial ruin or anything is way more than I am comfortable with. I tried to gently broach the subject with my fiance, and he pleaded with me to just keep it, that the proposal is the one thing in a wedding that the man gets to control and asking for a new ring is like asking for a ""do-over"" and telling him that he fucked up his one thing that he gets to do. I don't entirely agree with that because 1) I would hope he is not going to put 100% of the wedding planning on me, I want his input and 2) I am the one who has to wear my engagement ring for the rest of my life, and when I wasn't asking for much in the first place it seems kind of unfair that I should have to wear something that I don't like at all.

I haven't been wearing it much just because it is such an unwieldy ring, I put it in a jewelry box with the thought of passing it on someday to a daughter or granddaughter who might want it and just wearing a wedding band once we actually get married, but that upsets my fiance too because he wants me to wear it and doesn't want such an expensive item just sitting in a drawer.",False,False
1,"AITA for wanting to break up with my bf for not upholding his end of our agreement? | I'll try to keep this short.  My bf and I have been dating for 13 months and living together for 5.  I work part time and he was working two jobs.  I know that seems unfair, but he is old fashioned and didn't want me to work at all.   We had some arguments about money so our compromise was that I would work part time and the money I made from that would be all mine.

My bf was recently laid off from his full time job.  He still has his part time job.  He told me until he finds something new I'm going to have to pitch in for rent.   I was fine with this thinking it would just be part of the rent, but he's also making me pay for food as well.  I don't know what exactly is causing it, but ever since he told me to pay for food as well as rent I have lost pretty much all attraction to him.   I know it's gross, but that's just how I feel.

We are still doing our day to day thing, but I really am thinking of breaking up with him.  He promised to take care of me and now he's expecting me to cover costs that he promised to cover.   He made an agreement with me and is not holding up his end of it.  ",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting to send our daughter to therapy for shoplifting? (Husband disagrees) | This happened last week. Daughter is 14. 

She came home escorted by a local cop who said she was caught shoplifting expensive chocolates from a fancy grocery store a few blocks over. He said the owner had seen her lift a few small things over the past two years, like makeup or candy and things, and this time he finally caught her in the act. 

Thankfully owners not pressing charges but banned her and us from his store, which is whatever since I never shop there anyways. So my husband and I give her a reprimand. She cries and apologizes and I’m like good. You’ve learned your lesson. This is over. 

Well my husband REFUSES to let this go. He’s convinced there’s something wrong with her and she needs therapy. I think he’s overreacting. I shoplifted when I was a dumb teenager too although no one ever caught me. In fact everyone I grew up with stole something at one point or another. It’s part of being a teenager. It doesn’t mean you’re going to live a life of crime. It’s. Just. Being. A. Teenager.

0,"AITA for calling out my roommate’s fiancée on her manipulation and selfishness in-front of a crowd? | Long story but this is a couple months worth of build up so I got to vent

So for some context I live in a house with some great people, among them is my roommate. His fiancée however is a complete nightmare, she’s passive aggressive and plays the victim on issues where there shouldn’t even be a victim. 
I’ve been very patient with her because I really enjoy my roommates company regardless.

An example of this behaviour is one day  a few of us were talking in the kitchen (keep in mind it’s around lunchtime) then she comes in from the living room

Fiancée: maybe I should just do yoga in my room since it’s quiet but could you guys keep it down?

Me: yeah for sure, but I agree if you want complete silence the bedroom is always the best option.

F: (while walking away, in a sad ‘whoa is me’ voice) well I guess I just won’t do yoga in the living room ever again

She began to say how I wasn’t letting her do the yoga she needs and that I need to respect her use of the common area (keep in mind the kitchen is widely considered a common area as well) I backed off this time and let it slide.

Well a couple nights ago it all went to shit when my roommate and I were going to the movies. We were getting in the car and low and behold she comes out the door and gets in the car to join us, to my surprise. We drive to the movie theatre and we all get out and start walking together to the movie. After a minute I look behind me to see that the fiancée has vanished. I ask my roommate what the deal is.

Roommate: oh she thinks we’re walking to fast so she’s walking extra slow to make us feel bad

I was shocked he said this so calmly, as if it happens all the time. We get to the movie lineup and start waiting, after a minute or two I see her walking towards us and I can’t describe how dramatically slow she was walking. She finally shows up and says she wants the car keys and that’s she’s going. When asked why she said in front of all these people

F: Well you guys ditched me and left me behind and I feel sad now

My roommate and I both agree that she purposely walked slower so she could be mad at us, to which she said how we don’t care about her. She then turns and almost yells at me 

F: What are you embarrassed by me?!?!

I replied that yes, I was highly embarrassed and that this wasn’t the time nor place to cause such a scene over nothing. I then tell her that her guilt trip tactics and manipulation don’t work on me and not to talk to me until I say. She eventually left and joined later.

1,"AITA for semi-directly causing a very serious car accident? | This is a throwaway account because I want to be totally honest about this. Partly to get it off my chest and partly because this sub needs more assholes and fewer validation stories.

This is a true story from a very long time ago that I've only shared with maybe 3 people in my real life. I was driving on a very long, straight highway for a very long time. There was pretty much nothing around; just 3 lanes going east, 3 lanes going west, a median in the middle, and then a ditch on the side. On the other side of the ditch was a slight incline upward.

I was cruising along at about 80 mph while the flow of traffic was closer to about 75. I was in the left lane, slowly passing the other cars and was not weaving in and out of lanes or anything. This was satisfactory for a long time. At some point though, a black SUV flew up behind me. He must have been going over 100 because he approached me very quickly. He got a little too close for comfort, and there was a car to my right so I couldn't get out of his way immediately.

The next part of the story basically happened in bullet time. It was maybe 10 seconds at most.

**I held my ground and he held his; he was tailgating way too aggressively so I gave a little break check.**

The SUV backed off suddenly and seemed to get the message at first. While he was backing off, I was starting to pull ahead of the car that was blocking the middle-lane and \*probably\* could've safely cut over in front of them but I didn't.

But that only lasted a few seconds. The SUV began creeping up on me again. By this point, \*he\* could've cut to the middle lane safely too. Either of us could have, but neither did. He wanted to prove his might and make me move over, and I didn't like being tailgated. Neither was budging. I had sped up to about 95 by this point btw. My engine was straining because the car was a POS.

**He aggressively flew up so close I literally thought he was going to ram me.**

I was actually surprised he \*didn't\* hit me, that's how close he was. I couldn't see most of his grill in my rearview at all. I panicked for a second and slammed on the gas pedal to get some space behind me. And here's the big fuckup: Once I had about a car length of space, I gave him another break check. It was a brief tap, not enough to make my tires squeal or anything. But still, a break check at over 90mph while being tailgated.

The SUV's driver lost control of the vehicle. I saw him veer onto the median to my left and he actually began \*passing\* me at first. This makes me think that maybe my break check came at the same time as another one of his ramming bluff attempts; he was speeding up at the same time I checked him.

While still on the grass median he slowed slightly, suddenly cut hard to the right to try to get back on to the road (hopefully not to try to ram me?) and I saw the SUV in my rearview as he overshot the turn and went rightward nearly perpendicular to the highway. He went across all three lanes, went down noseward into the ditch, and slammed into the embankment. I watched the SUV shrinking into the distance in my mirror as it flipped up in the air, rolled over and over several times and came to a stop upside-down just above the ditch.

**The SUV was upside down, all of its windows shattered, probably half a mile behind me by now.**

I was frozen. My knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The song ""Guilty"" by Judge D was playing, appropriately enough, and this scene was permanently etched into my brain while watching what just happened. All the moral questions and doubts and what-ifs and holy shits were flooding my mind at once. In the span of maybe 1.5 seconds I contemplated what just happened and my role in it.

Why didn't he pass on the right instead of the median? Why didn't I? Did anyone die? Was there a baby in the car? Holy shit what if I just killed or injured somebody? Are the cops going to catch me? How fucked am I? Am I going to be able to live with myself if I don't pull right the fuck over right the fuck now?

**I decided to do the right thing or at least something close to it.**

I pulled over. I got out of the car, began calling 911 while sprinting desperately toward the scene. I didn't give my name but I kept things vague for now, just in case. I told them an accident happened and there may be injuries, and gave my approximate location. I ended the call, still sprinting and out of breath, as I approached a group of other drivers who'd pulled over about 50 yards from the SUV.

From this distance I could see its windows were all shattered and the driver and passengers were standing around looking pissed. I asked the group near me whether anyone was hurt and what happened. One of them told me he'd just come from talking to the driver and said nobody was hurt but they were furious about some asshole that had ""tried to ram them off the road"" (which I did not do).

That was enough to satisfy my at-that-time greyish moral compass. I felt like there was no benefit to me sticking around and getting fucked over by his situation; it was physically a one-car accident, nobody was hurt, and he was not able to control his vehicle.

Looking back, I'm selfishly glad I stopped. If I hadn't, I would still be wondering to this day (15ish years later) if someone's child was killed or something.

**So here's my moral dilemma. How much of an asshole was I?**

If someone else were telling this story I'd probably go with ESH.

**In my defense:**

* Point 1: He was the one in control of his vehicle, not me. He made the decision to swerve left onto the median instead of right into a clear lane. He had made the decision to aggressively tailgate me, repeatedly, until he lost control of his own vehicle.
* Point 2: He was being recklessly aggressive. A responsible driver should maintain enough distance in front of them that \*any\* emergency can be responded to immediately. The driver in front (me in this case) could break or swerve at any moment to avoid an animal or obstacle, and you have to be prepared for that. He was unable to control his vehicle when the emergency arose (my brake check).
* Point 3: This was entirely unnecessary from the beginning. We were both already significantly speeding when he first approached me, and 85mph is a very generous cruising speed on a 70mph highway on a clear day.

**In his defense:**

* Point 1: If either of us should have moved to the middle lane, it's me. It's illegal to pass on the right, so while it would've been safer for him to do so, it was really \*my\* responsibility.
* Point 2: I didn't have to brake check him. I could've slowly coasted until he passed on the right, I could've sped up, I could've done a lot of things. But I chose to tap the brakes at over 90mph while being tailgated.
* Point 3: I also did not approach him directly or speak to the police. I felt like I wasn't \*really\* involved in the accident, since our cars never touched, but I'm not a cop and it's not my place to make that call.  

(side note, not really relevant.. I have changed my driving habits significantly since then. I now get the fuck out of the way when someone tailgates. It's not worth it.)

**TL;DR**: Brake-checked an aggressive tailgater when I could've safely gotten out of the way. His car was destroyed, nobody was hurt, and I peaced the fuck out",False,False

I’ve been very upfront from the beginning that I won’t be able to make it to his wedding because I have a huge fear of flying/heights, but he won’t listen. He keeps offering to pay for my flights, but the issue isn’t that I don’t have the money for plane tickets, it’s that being that high off the ground terrifies me. I have explained this many, many times. I haven’t set foot on a plane since I was a child, and I’m not sure why he thinks this is magically going to change.  

I did look into alternate transportation options, and it would take me at least five days of traveling to get there and back via bus or train. I just started a new job a few weeks ago and it would look bad if I took that much time off just a few months after starting, so that’s a no go. 

I found out that my brother has been complaining to everyone in our family that I’m not making an effort. First of all, it’s a phobia, meaning it’s not just something I can just get over, and secondly, he and I aren’t even that close, so I don’t know why he’s so insistent on me being there. I’m not even in the wedding party, for God’s sake. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for my mildly obscene holiday decorations? | Hey folks! Me (27F) and my husband, also 27, recently bought our first home. It's beautiful, the neighbors hate us. So, full disclosure, it's a huge four bedroom with a basement and we are staunchly childfree. We needed all the space because we plan on adopting pets. Right now we have a tank of exotic fish, a very old turtle, four cats including our kitten Isaac l. We're hoping for a pair of Fancy Rats because we hear wonderful things. Anyway, as you can tell, we wanted to provide the perfect environment for our menagerie of fur-babies so we bought a house with a bit of land, in case we get a dog.

Our neighbors are all very much into kids and traditional family and when they learned we wouldnt be having kids they were absolutely beside themselves l. My husband and I are both ex-military so we're used to be childfree in a hostile LifeScript TM environment, we are unfazed.

Husband and I also have great sense of humor, especially where the holidays are concerned. However, our humor is a bit Toilet. At Easter was had giant blow up bunnies in suggestive positions, fake bunny poop everywhere. At Halloween we carved pumpkins with rather vulgar designs, had rather R-rated decorations, my husband and I dressed up really well.

For Thanksgiving we had a hilarious but historically accurate First Feast decoration on the lawn. We deep fried our turkey in the backyard this year so we had a pardoning ceremony and donated some money to a shelter in honor of the bird we didnt eat.

In short, we are young and enjoying life. Our neighborhood has a Facebook page and this year one of the neighbors publically called us out on the facebook page telling us the neighborhood voted and we are asked not to decorate our house for Christmas because of the risk of obscenities. I was disappointed as was my husband. However, we're Catholic so we actually take Christmas with some seriousness.

That said, we were enraged and we decorated the house to look like a gingerbread-candycane-winter fucking wonderland house. Its beautiful and the electric company thanks us. We only turn the decorations on from 5pm until 10pm. We are well-within the legal disturbance limits and have been cleared by law enforcement.

The neighbors still aren't happy because now we're getting a great deal of foot traffic to see the lights, especially our house. The same neighbor from earlier has been on facebook complaining.

0,"AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend at her birthday party | Using a throwaway and changing some details because she is a redditor. In the title I say girlfriend but we never had the conversations that defined what our relationship was. I had been seeing this girl for about 3 months, the last month and a half we have been spending almost every day together, she would stay at my house or I would stay at her house 3-4 days a week, so I had just assumed that we were exclusive and that the conversation defining our relationship was soon to come.
	
Her birthday was a week ago and she was having a birthday party that weekend to celebrate it. She asked me to come over and help make some food for the party, so I arrived at her house a few hours before the party had started. I had just assumed I would be spending the night over there since we hadn’t seen that much of each other (besides on her birthday we went out to dinner and had a great time) that week because of the holidays, so I brought a bag with a change of clothes and a toothbrush, ect.  So I helped her set up for the party and her friends and co-workers start to arrive. This was my first time meeting a lot of her friends and the night was going really good. It was a small party maybe 10-15 people, her friends all seemed really cool. The whole night she had been giving me a lot of attention (sitting on my lap, holding my hand, taking me aside to kiss) until her co-worker “bob” showed up. As soon as he walked in the door she got really excited ran over to him and gave him a big hug. After this point she began to completely ignore me and was pretty much hanging off of “bob”. She had introduced me to all her friends before bob had arrived but after he arrived she was just all over him.
	
I try not to get jealous, but watching this person who I care about flirting with someone else can really get to you. after about an hour of her ignoring me and flirting with this other guy I was starting to get angry, so I stepped outside to have a smoke. From the front porch you can see into the living room and I watched her and bob go over to the couch and she sat in his lap and began to kiss him. At this point I was pretty drunk and very angry, so I called an uber went inside to grab my back pack and as I was at the front door she came over to me and asked were I was going and I yelled at her “I’M FUCKING DONE WITH YOU, GO BACK TO  BOB!” and went home.
	

That night I received a bunch of calls and texts from her calling me an asshole and that I ruined her birthday party, I didn’t respond to her. The next morning I called her and told her I was going to come over and get my car if she wanted to talk. When I got there we talked and she said that she didn’t feel like she did anything wrong because we had never talked about being exclusive and that I was overreacting. I pretty much told her that I guess it was my mistake for assuming we were exclusive but what she did was still fucked up and that we are still over. This past week I have been receiving messages from her and her roommate calling me a piece of shit for ruining her birthday party, and that I am over reacting. Maybe I shouldn’t have yelled at her in front of people but I feel that making out with someone in front of the person you are dating is an asshole move.

TD;DR: girl I was dating made out with her co-worker at her birthday party so I broke up with her in front of her friends.

0,"AITA for telling my stepmom she’s completely spoiled my younger sister? | My stepmom is a really nice lady. She didn’t raise me but I like her and respect her a lot. 

She had a difficult childhood due to growing up in a veeeerrryyyyyy weird religious cult. She completely shunned that and like I say, although she didn’t raise me, with my young sister who is now 17 was raised with in a very pampered, whatever-my-baby-wants kinda way. 

It’s important to note my dad has hardly any savings and money to his name but my stepmom comes from a very very rich family, and since they left her property in her name before her exit from the religious group, she’s doing ok in life. She’s a loving woman and she tries to spoil me too with gifts that are just too big to accept. I think it’s because she didn’t get much as a kid and she wanted nice stuff so obviously she tries with me and my sister.

Me, I say no because it’s stuff like cars, vacations, etc. My sister has never felt the need to say no because she was raised into it.

My stepmom called me up independently of my dad or anyone else to vent about my sister recently. She was telling me since they’re all in the house together 24/7 my sister is being bratty and entitled.

I really *really* like my stepmom so I said what I said next in the most gentle way I could. But I essentially said my sister is spoiled and that’s due to her parents (I left it at both parents so she wouldn’t feel singled out) allowing her to never work for anything, she was simply handed it. I mentioned examples like the school calling up our parents to talk about incidents where my sister was partaking in online bullying against people etc, and she was never punished.

Like I say I tried to avoid finger pointing, just kept it general, but towards the end I did specifically say ‘she’s been completely spoiled’ and my stepmom got a little upset and started crying trying to explain herself. 

I felt really bad and tried to make her feel better. When I got off the phone I spoke to my wife about it and she thinks I should have just been a listening ear instead of giving my 2 cents and that I was an asshole.",False,False
0,"AITA - For not extending a specific invitation to two nieces for an annual family event that everyone is invited to? | Every year, on the last day of March, we gather as a family to celebrate my father-in-law’s life at a specific restaurant. He passed away many years ago, and that was his favorite place to eat. My mother-in-law foots the bill as part of the celebration and everyone in the family that can attend is always welcome. Sometimes people bring friends and it is never a big deal and we all celebrate a great man. This year, we had 3 of the 4 of my mother-in-law’s kids and their families come and had a wonderful time. My wife took a picture and posted it to social media to honor her dad. The unrepresented kid (I say kid loosely as she is over 50) took exception to this and flew off the handle because their family didn’t get an invitation and were purposely excluded. It is an open invitation, and she and all her children are adults with working phones. AITA for not reaching out to them and explicitly inviting them?

1,"AITA For calling Assisted Push-ups ""Girl Push-ups""? | For some Context: Back in Elementary, Our teacher told us that there were two kinds of Push-ups that you could do, there were ""Normal Push-ups"" which were the only ones us guy's were allowed to do during PT, and ""Assisted"" (Or as She called them ""Girl Push-ups"") which were the ones that she recommended the Girls of our class to start out with. because this was a rather small town out in dairy farm country, terms like this tended to stick with you even into later in High school. This is important for the Story.

So, I'm at dinner after school with my family (F, M, S, GM) While waiting for the food, we talk about our days and how they were. I finish my spiel and my sister goes next. She talks and eventually gets to discussing some new things she's been doing at the Gym, one of those things was that she is now able to consistently do Push-ups. Now Me (a self-proclaimed Workout nut who prays to 80's Jessie Ventura and Carl Weathers before going to bed) Was happy for my sister, so I asked how many she was able to do. It was at this point she clarified that she was able to consistently do ""Assisted"" Push-ups. Not knowing what those were, asked her what they were, to which she explained that they were push-ups with your knees touching the ground. 

Me, probably not thinking about what I was saying, blurted out ""Oh, so Girl Push-ups"". Her reaction to me saying this was a complete About-face of how she was acting up until that point, and it was punctuated by a single statement she made to my father ""See, I told you he would say that"". I was confused, and tried to figure out why she said that and what she meant, but I was met with a rather Hostile response when she stated that what I had called them wasn't the appropriate name for them. I retaliated with the fact that I didn't know there was another name for them. this continued until the rest of the family intervened, but (IMO) were extremely One-sided with their judgment, saying that I shouldn't have continued the argument and that I should have accepted that I was wrong, even though it was clear I wasn't defending what I had called them. If I was on the outer seats of the table, I would have simply stood up and walked out, as I didn't want to erupt with anger over how they were reacting to my ignorance.

Especially in conversations with others where she would talk ""for"" me. 

Today I told her that I really liked the one thing she brought with her about a week ago and wanted to ask her to buy it again sometime.

0,"AITA for smoking weed with my weed buddies during our school ski trip where one of them went off track and broke his back? | This happened a few years ago.

So me and my friend went on a school ski trip. We smuggled some weed with us cause skiing inst really our thing and we would just hang out and chill. At school we usually smoke with these 2 dudes that always join in and we both share our weed. We didn't really know each other, all we did was smoke during our breaks and after school. So it was only right that they found us during our school ski trip asking if we had some and we did. So we smoked some together and they went off to go skiing. 

We didn't know they would go off track after our smoking session and get injured. Seriously injured. One of the guys that went off track, fell and broke his back. Helicopter had to come and save them since the piste they were at was very hard to reach. The guy ended up in a wheelchair and couldn't walk for years.

I've always felt guilty for never reaching out to the guy and my other friend always felt like we were responsible for the accident. The guy can walk now and is fine, but he did get expelled from school for his irresponsible behavior and he probably had a really hard time recovering socially and physically.

1,"AITA for telling my boyfriend I'd like to share all information with my future husband | So we were having a talk about privacy and people telling us secrets. We got to me saying that the way I've been raised and see things, your spouse is like an extension of you and if I shared information that I wanted kept secret with someone that was married I'd assume they'd tell their spouses nonetheless and wouldn't mind. I think as long as they keep it between themselves a married couple is an item and I sort of expect that someone who's married wouldn't keep secrets from their spouse.

He then went on to ask if I'd share information about him if we broke up and I married someone else and I said that while I wouldn't voluntarily offer sensitive information, if my hypothetical future husband asked I wouldn't want to keep secrets from him. I again reiterated I consider married people one item and I think a secret shared between a married couple is not actually a breach of trust. 

He got upset saying he wasn't comfortable with that and that it made him a bit reluctant to share sensitive information with me. I told him this isn't even an issue atm. I don't and never will share the stuff he tells me with anyone other than potentially my husband. I kept his private information from the closest people that I used to share everything with and it's not like I have any intention of changing that. The only scenario where that would change would be if we broke up and I married someone else who happened to ask the right questions, which I think is a very big stretch. I said personally for me a relationship that's transparent and open is more important than my ex's feelings and as long as I was sure the information stayed between me and my spouse I saw no problem whatsoever.

Bf disagrees, and while he seems to have gotten over it very well I feel bad that I made him sad. It makes me feel like an asshole. Maybe I'm doing some great breaching of trust and not realising it, but it's just what I've seen and heard from all couples around me growing up and to this day.

1,"AITA for telling my boyfriend to return a gift he bought me? | My (22F) boyfriend (25M) and I joined the same D&D campaign for the past six months. This kind of stuff is his thing so I joined hoping to spend more time with him / get to know his interests more. Everything is still pretty new to me.  

Although I attend all weekly sessions, role-play, and take time writing down my stats, he is clearly more (mentally and financially) invested in the game than me. He bought himself books, figurines, and maps, listens to D&D podcasts, reads a bunch of D&D subs, and brings that topic into our conversations (Ex. asks me what class each of our friends would be in real life, sends me D&D memes, etc.). He even bought me a figurine and a starter dice set (7 dice for $5).  

Last week, he gifted me a beautiful set of pure rose quartz dice, which costed $80 (7 dice for $80). I was in shock. I thanked him for the gift, but immediately asked him to return them. He was visibly upset and told me he wanted me to have the prettiest dice in the campaign. I explained that I enjoyed D&D because I could use my imagination and spend time with our friends, and not so I could have the “best” apparatus to play with.  

I feel guilty for asking him to return something he genuinely thought I would like.

1,"AITA for slightly hurting my hand and my mother's hand because she was getting on my nerves and to prove a point | TL:DR  I poured hot water on my hand and then my mother's hand because she was pushing her religion on me. (Allah would protect my hand from the water if I prayed to him while doing the dishes).

I'm probably an asshole for this. 

So my mother is religious (muslim) and I'm haven't been religious for years, I've not outright told her about being an atheist for fear of being disowned and kicked out, but I've made it somewhat clear that I get annoyed when she pushes religion on me (leaving the room or repeatedly interrupting her about something unrelated when she talks to me about something religious) so she usually don't bother me with the more heavy religious things, daily 5 long prayers, go to mosque and the like (she doesn't even do these things so she's not forcing me to do it). 

Just the usual reminders to do the little things, like small prayers before doing certain things, eating with my right hand, always enter the bathroom with my right foot first (weird one but she keep bringing it up). Those I can put up with, I don't mind the constant reminders even if I never do any of it.  We even laugh about me deliberately doing the wrong thing sometimes when she reminds me. 

She has eased up a lot since I was a kid but sometimes she go back to the old ways. This day in particular she had pushed religion all day and I had put up with it but towards the end of the day I had had enough. I was doing the dishes by hand and I was using mild water. She came up to me said to use hot water because it's more effective or something (She must have heat resistant hands). I said no because it hurts and the dishes still get cleaned (she a bit of a neat freak and haven't complained about the cleanliness before) . 

She said ""Just pray to Allah and the water won't hurt you"". SURE THING MOM

1,"AITA For convincing my coworker to sign up for a pyramid scheme? | Ok so before I begin, I should probably explain my issues with my coworker. She is almost always 15-20 minutes late to work, forcing one of our other people to stay longer. She is dissrespectfull to everyone, including other coworkers managers, and even customers. I have seen her throw a knife because she was not allowed to take a break in the middle of a rush, I have seen her yell at a child for dropping his meal on the floor, one time she even walked out during a rush leaving us with no cashier and forcing people to stay late so the morning shift would not be behind on prep. Also before anyone comments it, several managers and nearly all our employees have complained to the owner about her, but she refuses to do anything about the sittuation. Now for the actual good stuff.

Today she came in 25 minutes after her shift started, and everyone was already pretty mad as it had been a long day already. Before she had even clocked in she was telling us about this new brilliant buisness she has been selected for. Im not sure which MLM it is but basically she would be selling hair extensions on instagram after paying for a startup fee. She seemed on the fence about the idea still, and she was worried about the 500 dollar start up fee. This is where I began to try and influence her descision. I made up storys about how my aunt used to do stuff like that and now shes rich, I said a bunch of stuff about investments to make it sound like a good idea, basically I did the MLM recruiters job for them. What it all boiled down to was her getting overly mad about the other cashier, she said a bunch of stufd about how ""she doesnt need this money anymore"" and ""how much better she is since she has been selected"", and she sent them the money on her break.

1,"AITA for replacing my sister at her shower? | My sister (J) is having her second baby next month. My mom was bugging her to have a shower and she wasn't into the idea but agreed. Event planning is my side hustle so I offered to plan it.

I worked really hard to put together a gorgeous set up and got a lot of stuff for cheap or free from vendors, with the understanding that I would tag them in the instagram posts. I used a white and rose gold color scheme, and asked the guests to please try and dress and wrap their presents in accordance with the scheme. I even got my sister and niece matching white outfits to wear to the party. 

Party day arrives and it's a disaster. Three mutual friends and my cousin respected the color scheme but everyone else just did whatever they wanted. Most of the guests didn't seem to care at all about how much work I'd put in and I could tell some of J's friends were mocking me. 

Then J shows up, and she's wearing purple. Cordory. Overalls. And my niece is wearing an old Dora the Explorer dress. I asked what happened to the matching outfits and she said that my niece spilled juice on hers and J didn't like hers because the top was ""itchy"" (it was cotton, I have no idea wtf she's talking about). J also doesn't seem to care about the gorgeous decor and food I've put together. She didn't even take the time to look around before going to chat with her friends in the kitchen. 

By this time, I'm done. I tell mom that I don't think J wants to be here and her friends don't seem to be having fun. I won a 200 dollar gift card to Chili's at a work event and had no intention of using it, so I gave it to my mom and suggested that she take J and her friends to get food since they clearly hate the baby shower. Mom agrees and they leave. 

I'm screwed if I can't pull off a decent insta post about this event because I've made promises to vendors, but I have no ""mom"" for my baby shower. I suddenly had a brainstorm that my friend Kaitlyn is pregnant and she's gorgeous and photogenic so I hit her up and asked if she could come over. My friends and cousin (who dressed appropriately) had stayed behind, so we managed to pull together a super cute photoshoot with Kaitlyn. 

Two hours later the others come back, they're more relaxed after some beers (not my sister obviously but the others) and food, and we have cupcakes and open presents. Then my mom notices that I've put up a teaser photo about the shower on my Instagram page but my sister isn't in it. I explain that Kaitlyn did me a solid and that it got some good shots so now I don't care about the clashing outfits and ugly presents ruining the aesthetic and everyone can have fun. My sister overhears this and freaks out that I replaced her in her shower photos and she starts crying and leaves.

1,"AITA for being ""ungrateful"" for an electronic gift that my grandmother got me (that I saw as a ticking time bomb)? WIB if I took it to the recycling center? | My birthday was yesterday. For some time now I've been expressing that I wanted to upgrade my PC (the components were aging quite a bit) and so I made a list of the parts I want and gave it to my dad, who sent it off to various family members to contribute. I'd contribute too.

I bought the graphics card and SSD, Dad bought the motherboard and RAM, Aunt got the me the processor and Grandma got me the power supply. (Dad tasked them, I didn't. I don't use Facebook because it's full of Karens.)

Now note that I had given everyone a specific part, within a reasonable price point, and they would get a huge deal on Black Friday, the day before my birthday.

Come my birthday, I turned 18 and everyone was to congratulate me for becoming an adult. Cheers and conversation over really good food was had. It was a great time.

Then I got my gifts. Everyone got me exactly what I wanted, and I expressed my greatest gratitude and thanks, and gave them a hug.

And here comes Grandma, with the power supply unit that she was tasked with.

Now I didn't ask for anything outrageously expensive (like those $200 RGB fully modular 80 Plus Gold power supplies with Japanese capacitors), but I did ask for a 750W supply with partial modularity that was around the $100 price point, and said good PSUs cost a lot.

I get my gift, and it's a unit from a brand I've never heard of called Logisys.

Again, I give my grandma the utmost gratitude, but tell her I am a little concerned. That I've never heard of this brand before and don't see any certification on it, and it looks very sketchy.

Grandma says she got it because it was cheaper and would still deliver on what I needed.

I then calmly explain that she needs to be careful with off-brand power supplies, as a lot of the cheap ones often have shoddy soldering, wiring, insulation and capacitors, and don't have any certification or testing. And if I put this in my system, my PC could potentially be fried.

My mom starts jumping on me and saying ""Stop being ungrateful, she put a lot of thought into getting that for you"" And Grandma and most others take her side.

But a few take mine and I tell her that there's a reason that you shouldn't buy unverified electronics from China, because they're often riddled with problems.

Eventually it turns into a small debate between family members about ""gratefulness"" and Chinese products and ""it's the thought that counts"", which kinda soured the mood and made me feel pretty bad. It only got resolved when dessert and coffee were ready.

Mom and Grandma gave me the stink eye for a moment and I just ate my cheesecake away from them.

Either way now I'm stuck with a piece of Chinese junk that I wouldn't dare put into my build. I think I might get myself a good one from Amazon on Cyber Monday.

0,"AITA for bringing my sister as my “date” to a work function instead of my fiancée? | I love my fiancée, I really do, but she burned me pretty bad when I took her to a charity auction for a company she felt was connected to a government she didn’t like. She was shockingly rude to the client, and I had to pull her aside and tell her to leave then make an excuse that she wasn’t feeling so well. It was successful though, since the client’s culture had an oddity where you weren’t “responsible” for a spouse’s outburst so long as you take measures to get them under control. It’s not a great outlook, but it worked out for me, and all cultures are different. I lost a lot of trust in her for this, though she apologized and felt bad, and said that she was feeling increasingly upset and lost control, somewhat understandably. We had a long conversation about it, worked through it, and she agreed to the boundary of not being involved with any work functions save some exceptions (dinners with coworkers I feel she can agree with, etc.).

I had another similar function and my boss was pretty insistent on me bringing a date. I told him about how my fiancée and I handled the last time I brought her, and he said that I could just bring a friend or anyone, really. It was a status symbol to this particular client, and the event was already one where PDAs would be inappropriate, so I could just bring a friend or basically anyone as a +1. He said I wouldn’t see the executives again, and given that I’m just an engineer I’d only ever be with their low level managers/engineers/computer architects and once the infrastructure was in place most likely not even them, and that all of these interactions are impersonal in the first place.

I decided to take my sister and my fiancée has been angry about it since. My rationale was that my sister was personable and diplomatic, there couldn’t be any issues of jealousy or me thinking that another woman was better to show off or something that might occur with a female friend, and that it communicates nothing except I need a +1 and can’t bring my fiancée. Surprisingly she has been pissy about it from when I told her. She thinks that it’s much worse than going alone since it communicates not that I’d just be better alone, but that she in particular is inadequate. She also thinks that it’s equivalent to hiding our relationship, “almost says” that my sister is “better to show off by my side” (which I find gross for her to say), and is a general public shot against our relationship to my coworkers who know her and see me bring someone else. I think she’s being ridiculous. She’s the one who made me not trust her in this situation, any coworker that knowledgeable about my life also knows who my sister is and that our boss explicitly informed us to bring a date, and my sister is clearly the most diplomatic choice since choosing her carries no undertones or implications that might arise had I brought a female friend. She still thinks I’m in the wrong for it.

1,"WIBTA for not telling my husband and starting a bank account on my own | Hello,

My husband and I have been married for two years. We just moved to a new city far from where I'm from for him to get a big promotion. I don't have a job, and I'm not really looking for one. He makes enough that I don't have to. So I keep the house (his job requires entertaining a lot), and I do some volunteer work. I'm happy with the arrangement.

I was talking with a lady at the organization I volunteer at. Just chit chat. She started asking me about myself. The topic got around to how I spend my time and my situation and she seemed horrified that I didn't have my own bank account. I was a secretary when I met my current husband and never really contributed to the household funds. We have a joint checking and saving. She suggested to protect myself I open my own account and find ways to put money in it. 

I mentioned getting my own account to my husband and he didn't like the idea. Her suggestion was to open it anyway and when I get groceries, get cash and put it in there to build an account. She suggested getting a credit card too but my credit is shot so I don't know if that's possible.

So, would I be the asshole for going behind my husband's back?",False,False
0,"AITA for being annoyed that I got kicked out and told to live with my dad because i might get the corona virus? | My little sister (17 y/o) has a weak immune system, me and my boyfriend (20 and 21) (we live in London. It’s hard to afford places. Don’t judge pls. We do pay rent) both live with my mama and my lil sister.
We have a relatively large house, me and my bf being on the second floor, my sis being on the bottom. Recently, my mums been scared that me and my bf will get the corona virus and somehow transfer it to my sister. So in the space of 24 hours, she made us pack up only a fraction of all of our belongings, and drove us to my dads tiny apartment where we now have to live out of our bags until whenever she decides it’s okay to step foot back in our house.
Since the room in my dads flat was originally my sisters, we are not allowed to take our clothes out of our bags or do anything apart from sleep on the bed in case we also spread germs around the room in the off chance that she visits in the near future. 
All of my belongings, musical instruments and most of my valuables are in my house, same goes for my bf, we aren’t allowed to go back into the house to retrieve them.
I understand my mum is scared about the virus but. Everybody is saying it’s over the top, if we aren’t allowed to be in the house, why is she? She works? She goes outside?
I’m so upset and confused and angry. She told me I was selfish for being upset. We haven’t spoken in two days, my sister called me up and told me not to touch anything in the room. I’m pissed.",False,False
1,"AITA for telling my sister I don't want to hear about her child's success? | My sister Ruth and I have children around the same age. Her daughter Nicole is two years older than my son Jack. 

Jack did fairly well in school but not amazingly. He was always well behaved and was never in any trouble. Unfortunately not long after leaving school a friend of his (NOT Jack himself) got involved in something very serious, and Jack agreed to help. The result was both Jack and his friend being arrested and sent to prison. They both served over two years but are out now. 

Jack accepts that what happened was nobody's fault but his own. He's never tried to blame me or my husband for it and has taken responsibility. He has made efforts to get himself into work including getting himself professional qualifications for construction and maintenance work. Unfortunately Jack's conviction (possession of a firearm) is treated as extremely serious in the UK and as a result most companies won't even consider him, and the only employment he can get is for temporary agencies, which is OK, but it means he can spend days or even weeks out of work at times. He is constantly sending out job applications but either hearing nothing or getting rejected. 

Nicole is the total opposite. Very clever, academically gifted, pretty and successful. She's a corporate lawyer, and Ruth is always going on about how proud she is which she has the right to do. 

When Nicole was a teenager Ruth used to tell me about how her and her husband Owen were called into the school because Nicole had been bullying other girls. She didn't think much of it and thought it was harmless and nothing serious, but it was serious enough that they had to fight to stop her being expelled at least once, and Ruth still insisted that Nicole was not in the wrong. 

The reason I say this is that when I mention that Jack is currently out of work and how difficult he's finding it, Ruth shows no sympathy. She says that he made his bed and she doesn't feel sorry for him. She also called us bad parents who raised a criminal. I was fuming and shouted over the phone that Nicole wouldn't be where she was if they hadn't gone out of their way to protect her from the consequences. Ruth became very angry and said that you can't compare ''harmless teasing'' to what Jack did. 

I told Ruth that she was the bad parent. Jack faced the consequences for his actions and is making every effort to do better. I also told her Nicole didn't earn her success since she wouldn't have managed it if the school had succeeded in kicking her out. Ruth slammed the phone down, and when I told my hubby he thought while I had a point, it was better left unsaid. I disagree. She has been rubbing her daughter's unearned success in our faces for too long and I don't think it's wrong to point out her hypocrisy.",False,False

1,"AITA Demanding my husband stop donating to charity | My husband has been donating 10% of his pay cheque to charity ever since he left college. He has justified it by saying he wants to make a positive impact on the world in his life and this is easiest way to do that. If it matters, He donates to a range of different charities that mostly focus on providing education/healthcare to children in developing nations.

I don’t like this as we have a mortgage/kids and there’s no reason for him to throw away 10% of his pay cheque like that. I’ve asked him to stop multiple times and he always says the same thing: “we don’t need the money anyway.”

While we don’t NEED it, it would be nice to build up our savings. So I finally demanded he stop throwing away his money and he just gave me a look and said “I’m disappointed in you.”

Then she created a fake Amazon account in her name, and ordered a Nintendo Switch and an SD card with it.About $360 of goods. I told her not to buy it, but she didn't listen to me (this was before she stole the card, I didn't know what she did). The items were addressed to the neighbor's house, in his name. A few days later the items came, and she stole them from his mailbox and opened them.

She then complained to Amazon about the packages not coming, possibly being stolen, and they refunded ""her"" money.

2 nights ago I found the Switch, and she told me what she did. She later admitted to stealing the SD card.

0,"AITA being upset my dad died | My mom died 10 years ago (cancer). My dad died last month(drunk driver). I’m 29. I have a good relationship with my parents and I didn’t take their deaths well.

When I got the news I cried a lot. I didn’t do much of anything for a few days. On the fourth day I think husband shoved me to wake me and said ‘Are you going to get up or do I have to get daughter breakfast again?’ I asked if he could make sure she eats and gets on the bus and he got huffy.  She’s 7 and pretty independent. She doesn’t need much help.

I got up to make sure she got off the bus safely. Gave her a snack and listened about her day. She’s not really affected by death because she didn’t know grandpa. He lives far away. She’s met him maybe three times, which is sad, but we talked on the phone a lot. 

After she’s fed and set up to do her homework I go lay down. Husband comes home from work. He comes up asks why daughter is playing a game. I said she could after she finished homework. He says now he’d be the bad guy if he kicked her off the tv so he could play his. I tell him they can play hers together but he doesn’t want that. She’s not supposed to be allowed games on school nights and he says I’m using the tv as a babysitter and not watching my kid. 

If I’m going to take time off work the least I can do is watch our daughter, clean and make sure there’s an actual dinner for him when he comes home. I told him I’m sorry but I don’t feel like doing anything. He said something like ‘he died four days ago get over it’ and went on a rant about when his dad died he went to work the next day because we needed the income. 

A month later he’s still bringing up how selfish it was to make him pick up all the housework when I was home all day. Then he was pissed I flew out for the funeral and spent three days with family when he had plans and had to watch daughter instead. 

Am I the asshole for being upset my dad died? My daughter was always fed and clean and taken care of. I just let everything else go and husband still won’t drop it.

He just so happened to have an open cup across the table filled with water. So essentially, I was studying when he threw his mousepad at me.  In retaliation, I threw it back and it knocked over his plastic cup and water got everywhere in his MacBook. We cleaned it but he is super paranoid that it will mess up his macbook. He says he planned on using it for 6 years and if it only lasts 5 I will have to pay however much that year costs in relation to the overall price (2.5k overall) 1 year would be at least 400 bucks.

0,"AITA for asking my MIL not to attend my children’s events? | I have been married for 25 years. We have a son (19) and daughter (17). When our children were born we lived three blocks from my MIL. She’s an extremely self absorbed person. She has never had any interest in my husband (her son) or my children ( her grandchildren). 

When DD was born, I asked her to keep DS while I was in the hospital giving birth. She let him stay at her house, but she hired a baby sitter to take care of him. That’s the only time DS has ever stayed with her in his entire life. DD has never stayed with her, not once. When DD was only two weeks old, DH got shingles. The doctor said it was dangerous for a newborn to be exposed to shingles. I had to pack up DS and DD and leave our home and leave my sick husband by himself. I went to MILs house, explained the situation, and asked for her help. She refused to help us. After my husband got better, she laughed at me and rubbed my nose in the fact that I asked for help and didn’t get it.  We told her how hurt we were by the way she treated us, but she refused to acknowledge our feelings and refused to apologize. Needless to say, I never asked for her help again. 

She moved out of our area a couple of years later, which was a relief for me. Since then, she has completely ignored us other than Christmas cards for the kids with a check inside and late birthday cards for the kids. That’s how it’s been for the last 15 years. 

Well, she recently moved back to our area. She didn’t even tell us she was moving. My husband got a text from his sister telling him when and where to be to help with moving day. That was the only communication. 

Out of the blue, MIL started showing up at my DDs school events, uninvited. You have to realize, she’s a stranger to DD. My DD is shy and introverted. She’s the kind of person that you have to win her trust. It creeped DD out when MIL started showing up at her events. It made her nervous and self conscious. I didn’t think it was fair for her to just show up after all this time and make DD uncomfortable. 

So........I explained to MIL that my children had never in their life had a support system other than me and DH. I told her that she was making DD uncomfortable and that she shouldn’t just show up at events without an invitation.

But she managed to convince me she didn't by saying the tea was caffeinated to the point where she wouldn't even bother putting a pill in. I believed this until my mother popped in to ask if she put the right number of pills into my tea. I flew into a rage, poured my tea out and yelled at my friend for doing that to me. I also might have locked myself in the bathroom and starting punching myself to get the anger out (a bad habit of mine) but I managed to convince my family I was punching the wall.

S lives with our parents in the big, expensive city where we are from.  There is no financial/cultural reason for that, she makes a good salary as a consultant and could easily afford to pay market rent somewhere.  She just prefers to live at home and spend her money on handbags and vacations. 

I live about two hours away in a much cheaper town, but return for the holidays with my kids every year. 

As anyone who has kids knows, this is the age where they get into every thing. 

S had to work yesterday, and unfortunately my kids got into her room.  If you haven't seen Invisaligns before, they look like plastic toys for Halloween.  She left the Invisalign box in plain sight on a shelf in her closet, which was left open.  

My kids got into them and began playing with them, putting them in their mouths, etc.  I stopped them when I found out and tried to put the Invisaligns in the little baggies, but S came home and immediately freaked out.  She stated screaming and throwing a fit, scaring my kids.  

S has demanded I reimburse her for the Invisaligns, which cost almost $4,000.  By no means do I intend to do this, that's an absurd cost and S doesn't even really need them.  My parents per usual take her side and think I am TA.

1,"AITA for having throwaway plates/utensils for meat eating guests? | So let me explain my friend group: there’s me (F), a vegan, and one other vegan (F), one vegetarian (M), and 3 meat eaters(MMF). Despite the fact that I don’t allow meat on my plates and silverware, we usually have dinner at my apartment because I have the most room and the other vegan is my roommate, and none of our other friends are roommates with each other so it works good. Our meat eating friends have no problem with the throwaways, but one of them brought his girlfriend tonight, and when I handed her a paper plate she looked insulted.

I assumed my friend would explain it to her beforehand, but apparently he didn’t, so I did. She was pretty mad, and refused to eat if we didn’t give her a real plate, and my roommate pretty much told her “I’m sorry, but I guess you won’t eat then”. My friend (her BF) tried to tell her that it was no big deal, and that it’s just how we do things and it’s nothing against her, but she wasn’t hearing any of it. She spent the whole night sitting on a chair, arms crossed, occasionally rolling her eyes, glaring at us or sighing. It was super awkward, and everyone left about half an hour ago, and when she left, she just walked out without saying anything. This was only the second time we met her, so we all haven’t really got off on the right foot.

My vegetarian friend said maybe we should just let go and let people put meat on our plates, but me and my roommate, as well as one of our meat eating friends think we shouldn’t have to, as they are our plates and we’re only doing it to respect our values. Are we the assholes for not letting meat eaters put their food on real plates?

In case anyone is wondering, if they are eating the same food as us, they get to use the real stuff, and if not, they bring the food precooked. If it’s cold, we do allow them to heat it up in our oven, but that’s as far as it goes with meat in our kitchen.",False,False

When we got together we earned about the same and it seemed easiest to just put all our earnings in one account and pay for everything out of that. After a few years he moved to a different role at work and his earnings almost tripled. 

Shortly after, we had our son and it was a no-brainer that he would continue to work and I would stay at home to look after our son and run the house. I was worried about being totally reliant on him but he has always assured me that it’s OUR money, not his. I know I’m really lucky that he earns enough that I don’t have to work, and our son is now 11 and I work a few hours a week but my earnings are peanuts compared to his. 

Sometimes we disagree on financial decisions and it seems to me that whilst most of the time he’s keen to assure me that I have as much right to make decisions as he does, it feels like when there’s a big disagreement he “pulls rank”. 

I would like to book a particular holiday as a family, because it would be lovely, our son would be over the moon (I’m aware it won’t be long until he doesn’t want to go on holiday with us anymore!) and we can afford it, it’s just a matter of opinion about whether we should spend that money on it. Don’t get me wrong, we have at least one or two fantastic holidays a year but this is one that he doesn’t consider value for money. 

I’ve offered to sell some of my things to help fund it if it makes him that uncomfortable but he’s having none of it - he considers it a waste of money and therefore it’s a “no”. I’ve had this conversation with him but he just won’t talk about it.

Here’s the catch about this party. It’s officially titled the “Super Bowl where we don’t watch the Super Bowl party”. My girlfriend and I have a very large LGBTQ friend group, and I have a lot of theatre friends. Nobody in this group watches the game. Though none of us subscribe to stereotypes, we kinda ham it up this day just for fun. We do watch the halftime show, have cocktails and apps (not typical stuff for the Super Bowl like wings) and typically put on an old movie for background ambiance. People dress up a bit. I was VERY explicit in the description of what this party was to Lara. I told her to not expect to watch the actual Super Bowl. She seemed fine with this.

Well, yesterday she showed up with her boyfriend, which was fine, even though we hadn’t expected him. He was...not thrilled about the situation and asked if he could turn on the game. I was a bit annoyed by this, but I felt bad so I said yes. He then asked if we had anything to eat, so I pointed to all the apps. He seems annoyed by this as well. Finally, he started shouting at the TV, which just got things out of whack. I asked him if he wouldn’t mind reigning it in a bit and he said “Whatever. This fucking sucks. Why are you people like this?” So, as nicely as I could, I told him to leave. I don’t know what “you people” meant but I absolutely could sense a tone.

She said the plan was to go to Walmart to get snacks and then go back to her house to watch movies. While video chatting, I saw how she was dressed and asked ""babe wtf??"". Her boobs were hanging out and she was wearing a halter top. To me, it looked like she was dressed like a ho. Let me point out that this girl is not a ho and her personality is one of a pretty wholesome girl, which is why this came as such a shock to me.

Long story short: I told her outright at the climax ""I definitely don't think you're a ho, but you're dressed like one."" She then said that it's how she dressed and I told her she should change that. She said that people dress like that and it's fine. To win the argument, I brought up how she's constantly talking about how she went to this horrible high school and a majority of girls and guys there are pretty bad. I basically said that she should take that into consideration when she thinks about where her way of dressing may come from

Well she eats more then any person I have ever known, especially considering her physical appearance, she is 5'4, petite, thin and yet she eats more than I do and I am 6'6 and a bit of a gymbro. To put it in to perspective, our food bill each week is roughly three times compared to what I usually spend alone.

Yet she seems extremely selfconcious about this and as a result will act surprised when something is gone, try to blame me, states I am eating too much whenever I eat anything, essentially, she tries to deflect her eating habits and projects them on to me out of embarrassment about her eating so much I guess? The thing is, I don't care about her eating habits, she can eat whatever she wants to eat what I am done with is her constantly trying to blame me, whining about food and picking fights about it.

I talked to her about it multiple times, argued with her about it multiple times but earlier today I just got so tired of another comment, this time brought on by me making a sandwhich  at 2 PM when I had eaten  at 10 AM I know right, horrible.

1,"AITA for revoking an invite because the guy is too old? | So I invited a couple of my coworkers I frequently went out with to go out for my birthday this weekend, we are mostly around our early twenties (me turning 19 being the exception). There was, however, another coworker present who were generally friendly with. He’s in his mid to late 40s, so I didn’t think to invite him because I didn’t even think he’d be interested. 
So go forward a few hours and they come back, one of the coworkers asking if he could join. Now I know I shouldn’t have made the invite in front of him, in hindsight, but I said ‘I guess’ hesitantly. The thing is he’s a nice person I don’t have any problems, but frankly I just didn’t want him to come. I don’t know him that well and to be honest it’s my birthday weekend, it was really rude for them to invite him on the spot in front of me. He’s also quite a bit older, what do we really have in common? I just didn’t want to hurt his feelings but I revoked it. AITA for uninviting him?",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting to hangout with my bestfriends new girlfriend | We've been friends for 4 years and used to be romantically involved, he recently started dating someone, it is hard to adjust to since we used to spend all of our free time together.  He told me that we would always have ""our days"" a couple days a week where it is just the two of us spending time together. 
He now wants for his girlfriend to hangout on some of those days too, I feel like this would ruin the time we have together. He isnt asking for me to hang out with them on ""their time"" just for her to hang out on our time. 
I told him this would make me feel like a third wheel and be awkward due to our past relationship. He got upset with me and said I'm being unreasonable.

0,"AITA for not inviting my sister to ""mommy outings"" because she doesn't live with her daughter? | I (36F) have two kids (8M and 6M). My middle sister (34F) has one kid (9F). I also have two close friends with children in similar age ranges. 

I also have a younger sister (30F). She has a child, too, but the situation is a bit more complicated. The man she had the baby with was a friend of hers, not someone she was in a relationship with, and he was the one who wanted to keep the baby when they found out she was pregnant. When the baby was born, my sister relinquished full custody to the father. She does visit her kid about every other weekend, and does think of her as her daughter, but they're not close by any means. She's not actually playing any role in raising her daughter. 

Me, my middle sister, and my two friends have semi-regular ""mommy outings"" where we leave the kids with our husbands or with babysitters and go do something fun. Sometimes we drink a little. Sometimes we just go see an R rated movie. Whatever we're doing, it's a way for all of us to relax and talk about raising young kids with other women who understand.

When my younger sister found out we were doing this, though, she got very upset. She wanted to know why we hadn't invited her. Personally, I think it's fairly obvious why we didn't – because she's not experiencing the same things that we bond over. She might be a mom, but she's not actually doing any mothering. 

She said that it was incredibly disrespectful to ignore her, and it showed that we don't consider her daughter a ""real"" part of the family. She says that we don't invite her because she doesn't fit into our ""perfect, suburban vision"" of what motherhood looks like. 

I'd like to point out that it's not like we don't spend time with our younger sister. I see her as often as I see my other sister, and more often than I see my friends.

0,"AITA by scaring an old woman with her public records? | So there is this old woman who keeps harassing teenagers/minors online who have eating disorders.

She goes into DMs as well and sends them photos of food, tells them they're going to hell, and even sends photos of herself when she was in her 20s and anorexic. Tells some of us that Recovery is impossible and to not even try.

So she came into my dms a couple of days ago and harassed me so I sent her memes to get her to leave me alone.

She then messaged me on another account gifs of people and stuff with popcorn and telling me to get lost (I had liked a post about her and how she's rude to us disordered people)

By then i had enough and thought I'll scare her so i looked up her name that she used for her account and behold, all of her information is public record. I sent her privately in DMs her own address and now she's spooked. She started saying how her husband is allegedly a cop and will find me (my acc doesnt have my name or anything) but now im kind of like damn...

0,"AITA for calling out a rude couple on the train and then not telling them that they left their bags behind | I was on the train between 2 major cities, it’s a 1.5 hour journey so obviously most people want a seat. If you buy tickets in advance you get given a seat reservation, but if you buy them at the station you don’t and you may have to stand if there’s no seats available. I’d booked a seat so I was all good. Usually when you get on the train there are little screens above each seat which say if they’re reserved but they weren’t working that day, and reservations still apply even if the signs are broken. 

Anyway, I’m on the train and this couple who’d been out shopping (had loads of bags from clothes shops) got on and sat down. A few mins later some people get on and politely ask this couple to move as they’re sitting in their reserved seats. Usually people just accept this and get up and move because they know they haven’t booked, but the guy from the couple asked to see this persons ticket to make sure it was actually their seat (wtf, who made you the ticket inspector) anyway, it was their seat and so reluctantly the couple move to some other free seats opposite myself and my partner. 

The train was filling up pretty quickly and I realised it was gonna be full, it was 5pm on a weekday so lots of commuters. A lady and her son come along, looking confused as there were people sitting in their reserved seats (this couple), they were clearly tourists so couldn’t really speak english and weren’t sure of the etiquette of how to ask for their seats. Eventually they realised that their seats were taken and so asked the couple to move, again this guy gets all rude like ffs, and asks to see their tickets. At this point everyone on the train is watching. The couple are complaining and swearing under their breath whilst getting up. The kid is just standing in the aisle looking awkward not really knowing what to do (standing a bit in the way of this guy but not massively)  and then:

HIM (rude guy to kid):  are you gonna fucking move then so I can get up

 This kid is literally like 9 years old

So I told the guy: you don’t need to be so rude

HIM: what did you just say to me

ME: I said you didn’t need to be so rude. He’s only a child and you were in his seat anyway

HIM: Oh for gods sake (walks off in a huff with his girlfriend)

They left all their shopping bags under the table and to be honest, although we noticed we didn’t say anything because he was being a dick.

When I told all this to my friend later she said that even though they were being rude it was bad of us to not tell them that they left their bags. Well I didn’t really feel like walking off after him after he was speaking to people like that so nah I wasn’t gonna tell him - karma for being an asshole.

1,"AITA for not checking my phone | A couple weeks ago I had a wedding to attend. A friend of mine was having a cookout and casual reception at his house with setup the night before. The wedding fell on my wedding anniversary.


My wife was planning to stay home with our three kids and I told her I was just going to go to the 11am ceremony and then come home so we could all do something as a family. The kids had a birthday party to go to so it worked out. 


Well time got away from me and I ended up staying until midnight. I checked my phone as I was leaving and saw a couple of missed calls and texts from my wife, wondering what was going on. Turns out she had also called a mutual friend who had been at the wedding, but they had left around 3pm so didn't have any news for her. 



Wife is unbelievably pissed. I told her I didn't have cell service inside - the place has a metal roof. She thinks I'm full of shit and is mad that I didn't take the initiative to go outside for better service.

1,"AITA for expecting a house warming present? | This had happened a few months ago, but it left me wondering if I was the AH. 

I (27F) bought a house a year ago with my own savings, as a family home for me and my husband. My husband is a full-time student, so we depend on only my income (this is relevant for later). Prior to this I had been renting for the last 7 years and moved on average every two years due to the landlord selling or wanting to move back into the flat themselves. 

My sister (28F) married a year ago to a man from overseas and has recently managed to bring him over. In the meantime she has secured a flat to rent, near to her workplace and she and her husband have both moved in. A week after she moved in, my brother (M23) bought her an item of furniture for £150. Prior to finding out about this gift from him, I was helping my sister unpack and settle in. I noticed a cute wall hanging and asked her where she got it, and she commented that it was a house warming present from our brother. I asked if he got her anything else, and she mentioned some cute floral mugs but didn't comment any further. 

My older sister (F33) mentioned what a generous gift my brother had given to our sister, and to my surprise, mentioned this item of furniture. I don't know if I was an asshole to feel hurt I did not receive anything, and I actually bought a house which was a big deal. It isn't the price tag, I don't care how much he spent on her, I just felt hurt he didn't get me anything. I saved up for 7 years whilst renting to be able to afford to buy my own home. Even when I did manage to get on the property ladder, I couldn't afford to furnish my home, and only had a sofa, TV and a mattress. It wasn't until 6 months later until I could afford bedroom furniture and a dining table set. I do not expect my family to help me afford furniture in any way, I was more than content with what I had and just happy I was no longer renting, of which I had previously done so for years. 

I texted my brother asking what he bought our sister and he confirmed the item of furniture. I responded with a jokey text just saying he won't have to spend too much on a gift for me. He replied he was just going to give me some cash the next time he sees me. I couldn't help feel hurt as I bought a house a year ago, and this was a significant achievement for me. This was my sisters first time renting as prior to this she was living at home with our parents. We both earn a similar wage, and recently her husband got a full-time job  as he is legally allowed to work. So I don't think any disparity in income influenced my brother's decision. 

My brother did give me £50 the next time he saw me, of which I was very grateful for and thanked him.

0,"AITA for yelling? | I (38F) live with my family - husband (45M) and 2 kiddos (9 and 13). We have 2 and 1/2 bathrooms in this house; I went to take a shower in my bathroom, the master, that is only accessible from my room. I closed the door and locked it. 

These people have a bad habit of just bursting into the bathroom - I probably need to do a better job of enforcing boundaries. So during my  <10 minute shower, the kids knocked twice (only stopped from walking in by the locked door), and both times I yelled that I’d be out in a minute. My husband then PICKS THE LOCK and came in THREE SEPARATE TIMES for piddly crap (hanging his shirt for tomorrow, placing clean socks on the counter, stuff like that). After the 5th interruption, I snapped “I guess that lock just doesn’t scream ‘stay out’ like I’d intended.”

I would often get texts asking ‘where are you going?’ Or ‘who’s house are you at?’ Constantly every day. Having my every move watched my my parents made me uncomfortable and felt like an invasion of privacy. Just yesterday, I got into a big fight with my dad over the app. So around 3 months ago my mom was constantly watching my location and my dad took her off for being crazy about it. Whenever I unshared my location with him a few days ago though, he started freaking out and cut off my allowance, took away my license, and more. He blames me for starting this big fight (which is still going on through text while I’m in school) I accused him of being a hypocrite and he just kept swearing at my mom and I.

They live about an hour away.  They suggested to my wife that they would prefer to stay in our apartment and go to the farmers market the next morning.  We live in a nice town with cafe and market in walking distance.  All cool.

They visit often and stay over occasionally but mostly sleep on the pull out couch (we only have 2 bedrooms, one is a nursery so only one bed and two couches in the living room, one pulls out).  Apparently they don’t find the pull out couch very comfortable - to be fair they are in their mid 60s.  I’ve recently learned that when we’re out of town they sleep in our bed.  They or my wife always change the sheets afterwards and make the bed.  Upon learning this I expressed to my wife that it makes me uncomfortable.  I would never sleep in their bed - though they have a guest bedroom so I guess I’m not faced with sleeping on a couch.  Still, I’m confident I wouldn’t do it,

Anyway, they’re really nice and good to us, help out w the baby, etc.  Its not the people.  I just don’t like the idea of anyone sleeping in our bed other than my partner and I.  I want to ask them to sleep on the couch.  My wife says I’m absurd and it aint happening.

I said yes of course, even though my husband and I haven’t even been able to get around the getting pictures taken with her, beyond hospital photos. 

She asked me this week which day she should book and appointment and when I told her I asked her to just let me know what time so I can bring the baby there. Mom acted astonished, and frankly offended, that I wanted to be there. She asked why I wanted to be there and if I thought they were going to do something to the baby. I tried explaining that it would be a good idea for me to be there in case the baby freaks out and is crying, because they can’t take pictures if she’s crying. Mom insisted that the baby had never freaked out with them before so I said that I wanted to be there regardless. She rolled her eyes at me and started to look towards my dad for backup, but I honestly called her out on rolling her eyes at me and started to get really angry that she was offended.

Finally I told her ultimatum style that either I’m present for the photos or they aren’t happening. They left my house and my mom hasn’t spoken to me since. I texted her today to ask if they had gotten an appointment for pictures and she said no they had other plans. It sounds like she isn’t getting them done now, I assume because I want to be there? 

AITA for putting an ultimatum on the pictures that I must be present? Is that really something so horrible to request?

About 6 months ago she started going to the gym seriously and added quite a bit of muscle, especially to her ass and thighs (that was her goal, to get an ''Instagram butt''). She's got that 'thick' look going on. You can tell she works out.

I'm a skinny guy, I've never really lifted weights. I'm 6''2 but only weigh 155lbs. Sometimes I go running though, so I've got a lot of endurance. My GF asked me to come to the gym with her and work out with her, so I agreed.

Well she went to squat so I went to see how she does it. She loaded some weight on and performed a set with the highest weight she's ever done. She struggled but was able to *just* perform it. She was pleased with herself after it so I asked if I can have a go, as I was curious.

Well I performed the squat and was able to do her weight quite easily. So I wait a few minutes to try again, but this time I load on an extra 15kg plate on each side and try it. I struggle but I'm able to perform the set. 

My GF looked shocked that I was able to do that, later on she said that I ''ruined'' her session by being an ''asshole'' by feeling the need to ''one up'' her. I told her that I have no interest in doing that, I was just testing my limits. AITA?",False,False

At first when she began talking about him, I was supportive/excited for her. However, a few days ago she showed me a picture of him and it kinda shocked me. 

To put it bluntly, I have a...checkered past, and I used to buy H off this guy (I'm going on five years clean now).

He's also the kind of guy who always comes across very charming at first and reveals his true colours later. Obviously, I don't want my friend getting mixed up with something like that.

1,"AITA For wanting a pet snake? |  

**OP:**

**My RM and I have been living together for a year. In our first apt, we had a 2br 1 bath place that was tiny. I usually was in my room, but aside from our rooms there was really no privacy or space. We lived together fine, but it felt cramped. This summer we moved into a much larger 3br 2 bath apt.**

I pay for two bedrooms (one is my office) and I also pay the pet fee for my two cats. My RM has known that I have wanted a pet snake and has been adamantly against it even before we moved in together (which I agreed to, esp because the space we were going to be sharing didn’t allow pets). Now that we are in a bigger place, I would really like to bring a snake home since I have room in my bedroom.

The snake that I want to bring home is a ball python. Ball pythons are generally known to be docile. The snake will NOT leave my room. My sister has agreed to care for the snake whenever I travel since she has her own ball pythons. Basically, my RM would never see the snake, and will be very securely contained within my room to make sure it does NOT escape. I will be adding a door draft stopper to my door to make sure, even if it does escape, it will not be able to leave my room. I know my RM has afraid of them, and I would never be malicious and abuse her fear of them. I genuinely love and care for my RM, and would take every precaution to make sure she feels safe.

I’ve always admired snakes, I think they’re beautiful and I’ve always wanted to have one as a pet. My art brand is named waxsnake in honor of them, my first tattoo planned is a black snake on my arm or my back. I have been set on the idea of a pet snake for a very long time. Now that we are living where space and conditions allow, I really want to bring one home.

RM:

When discussing moving in together OP suggested down the line getting a snake. I always said I never wanted to live in a same house with a snake every time it has been suggested. I have a huge snake phobia. I had snakes in my yard growing up and would have anxiety attacks when I was surprised by one. Like full on sobbing and needing hours to recover. Everytime I see one I feel pure panic and afterwards I feel uneasy in my own skin. 

When I was a kid there was a pet snake in my house and my parents reassured me a thousand times it would not get out. It did get out and I never felt quite as safe in my house even when it was found. OP is my BFF and has always known about this phobia and has assured me in the past that she would not get a snake if we lived together, but she does bring it up from time to time and I always say no, cause it makes my skin crawl to think about. 

I want her to be happy but I would never feel comfortable in my own home, even if I never see it.

0,"AITA for choosing my dog over my nephew to be the ringbearer at my wedding? | Hi Reddit, I'm honestly not sure where to come down on this. My GF and I have been dating for 4 years, engaged for 1, and our wedding is in a month (using a friend's backyard). We started dating right when I got my dog Shelley from the pound, and we've all been together ever since. I got really into training Shelley and she's super well-behaved, knows all sorts of cool tricks, and I thought it would be funny and memorable if she was the ringbearer for our wedding ceremony. I got her this funny dog t-shirt to wear, I've been working with her on holding the ring basket, and I think it's going to be great.

The issue is this. Our families are both thrilled about our wedding, including the kids on both sides. One of them is my girlfriend's nephew (10M). The other day we were over at my GF's sister's house for a barbecue when her sister came up to us with the nephew alongside, saying he wanted to ask us something. We kneeled down and he kind of quietly asked if he could be the ringbearer for the wedding. I think he's been looking for something to do since we've been trying to save money and everyone on both sides has been helping us, so I'm pretty sure it's not just something his mom put him up to.

Anyways my GF and I both thought it was really sweet but we told him that we already had someone picked out for the role, and offered to let him help in another way. He said okay but he definitely looked like he was about to cry. Later my GF was talking to her sister and under some pretty direct questioning let her know that our dog was going to be the ringbearer. Things got pretty uncomfortable, there was no shouting or anything but we both could tell her sister and her sister's husband were pissed so we left.

My GF and I are both thinking about how to solve this. We are both on board with having the dog be the ringbearer, it's our wedding, it's a once in a lifetime moment, and surprisingly no one else in the family seems to have a problem with it now that they know. But I don't want to cause any rifts over what's such a minor thing, and it's kind of a small thing to sacrifice to smooth things over with the family, and it's not like Shelley is going to care.

I mention that because she relies on me more and more as her pregnancy is ending. So a friend of mine reached out to me the other day and said he has an extra ticket for a football game cause someoke bailed, so I said yeah without hesitation. 

I got home and told my wife, then she started becoming angry/upset. Claiming what if she needs me or something happens or if someone breaks into our home and she’s scared(we live in a low crime area). Or if the baby somehow came early .She said I should have asked her first, and she hopes I’m not this selfish when our baby comes. 

That pissed me off because I’m not selfish. I’ve done so much for her.",False,False
1,"AITA - If I keep wearing my hand lotion even though one of my coworkers asked me not to because the smell of it supposedly bothers her allergies |   

So one of my co-workers came by my office today to tell me that she has a perfume allergy and asked if I could not wear whatever it is I am wearing at work anymore because it bothers her allergies. I don’t wear perfume, but I do have some hand lotion from Bath and Body Works that can be a little fragrant when I first put it on. I told her I wouldn’t wear it anymore, but... I kinda still want to.

Look, I know it sounds like a dick move, but hear me out. It’s not that don’t care that it bothers her and if she was in my department or if she was one of my co-workers that I work with regularly or if our offices were anywhere near each other, I’d absolutely stop using it. What annoys me and why I want to keep wearing it is that the co-worker in question and I don’t work anywhere near each other. 

We are in the same building and on the same floor, but she is on the opposite side of the building from me, down a long hallway with 2 locked doors separating us. I often go weeks at a time without seeing this woman. The only reason she even smelled me today was because we just so happened to be in the employee kitchen at the same time for all of 2 minutes. I am only in the employee kitchen maybe once a day and the chances of me running into her there are slim, because we are on pretty different schedules.  

Also, and I hate to be like this, but there is a part of me that is a little doubtful as to how much it's actually ""bothering"" her allergies vs how much she just doesn't like the way it smells. I am asthmatic and allergy prone myself, so I know and empathize with what it's like to have an allergy/asthma attack, but she came to my office and closed the door behind her (essentially shutting herself in with my sent) and spent 5 minutes telling me how much it bothers her, all the while not sneezing, coughing, wheezing, no watery eyes, nothing. I am going to choose to believe that she wouldn't just fabricate an allergy as some kind of weird power play, but this lack of symptoms is highly suspect.     

Honestly, I’ll probably just stop wearing it just to avoid the drama that could potentially ensue if I don’t, but would I be the asshole if I didn’t?",False,False
1,"AITA for making my son stay home? | Hi, my son (22) and daughter (14) live with me and I am leaving for 1 month to see my family this summer. I am leaving my son in charge of watching my daughter at all times during that month. He works from home so work is not an issue, but he still thinks it is not fair since he already has other plans and cannot take her everywhere he goes.

0,"AITA for not signing a non-disclosure agreement my bar customer sent me after he told me about his app idea? | I tend bar in a city neighborhood with a lot of regulars. Most are great, some are quirky, and a few suck—but hey, that’s bartending for you.


One regular that falls somewhere in the middle of that spectrum is “Jim”. Jim will talk to whoever he can about far-fetched, clearly made up stories for as long as he possibly can. He’s somewhat of a nice and friendly dude—just insecure and socially unaware.


A few weeks ago Jim was going on about this new app idea of his. I was making drinks for other guests while chiming in with “Uh huhs” as Jim laid out his entire plan. Honestly, I wasn’t listening close enough to tell you if the idea sounded decent. I just let Jim have his fun.


Yesterday, Jim came in, plopped down with a stack of papers, and was visibly excited to talk to me. Low and behold it was more info about this app idea of his. I wasn’t stoked to hear about this whole thing again, but he had printed out his plans so I knew he was excited. In the middle of showing me his home drawn graphic ideas and “research”, Jim passed me a paper and said, “Oh, and here is the non-disclosure agreement for you to sign. You know, just so my idea doesn’t get stolen.”


I laughed. Jim didn’t. He stared at me blankly. So I replied with a smile, “Oh, Jim. You don’t have to worry about that. I’m not going to do anything. That app idea is all yours, my friend. I’ll stick it bartending.”

“Well, if that’s the case, why won’t you just sign it?”

“Because you don’t have to worry about me, man. I wouldn’t be able to figure out all of that stuff anyway.”


Then Jim awkwardly looked at the paper, looked back at me, then started shuffling the papers together and placed them back in his envelope. He wrapped up talking about his app, changed the subject briefly, but within a few minutes asked for his check and left. 


I’ve felt bad for the guy ever since. I know I’m one of the few people he interacts with on a weekly basis, and I clearly deflated him and his excitement around this app idea of his. My co-workers are giving me shit for not playing along and signing the NDA because “nothing’s going to come of it” and “it probably wasn’t even real anyway”. 


But at the end of the day, he’s a bar customer. He’s not my friend. I don’t know him. I’m not going to get involved in any business ideas of his. And I didn’t want to give him my signature.


So... AITA for not signing this damn non-disclosure agreement?",False,False
0,"AITA for not being emotional on my wedding day? | My wife and I didn’t do many traditional things for our wedding. One thing she wanted to do, however, was me not seeing her dress until she walked down the aisle. I agreed. She kept saying I’d love it, she loved it. She and her best friend (maid of honor) kept sharing reaction posts of grooms happy crying upon getting a first look at their bride, tagging me in it, saying “this will be you!”

Day of, wife walks down. She herself did look beautiful, as always. However, I was not big on the dress. To me, it wasn’t at all flattering. But I didn’t focus on that. I focused on her. I smiled. I didn’t break down in tears like some reaction pics/videos. The maid of honor kept nudging me until I looked at her and mouthed “stop”.

We got married, kissed, the whole thing. Everything was fine at the reception. Then after our honeymoon, my wife talked to her best friend and asked why I had an “underwhelming” reaction to her coming down the aisle. I said I didn’t. She said there are pictures that guests took and I don’t look how she pictured. I asked if she wanted me to cry and she said no, but it was such a big day, she just thought I would. I said I was estatic to marry her and that showed, without me being over dramatic. I also said I had her friend nudging me the whole time and that was unfair to me. Finally I asked if we had a wedding or a play, because I never got lines. Now she’s mad at me.

Am I an ass here? I do feel bad she’s disappointed but I couldn’t force myself to have a reaction.",False,False
0,"AITA if I make someone else reschedule their surgery? | I was due in for surgery today. I waited for hours before being told that they’d had an emergency and couldn’t get me into a theatre. I’ve been offered the chance to have it on Wednesday, pushing someone else back. 
If not, they’d reschedule for a few weeks later.

A few things to know: 
1.) My surgery is non-essential and could feasibly take place at any point- my condition won’t worsen with time. 
2.) While MY surgery is not urgent, the procedure I’m having is also offered to cancer patients
3.) I’ve travelled to a different country to have this procedure done, and my parents have to drive/pay for hotels/miss work etc. Any delays would exacerbate these inconveniences.

What should I do? Should I go in on Wednesday and possibly delay healthcare to someone suffering from cancer? Is it worse if I ask my parents to make a second trip in a few weeks time? I’m really struggling to find the ethically best option.",False,False
1,"AITA for finally questioning this guy on his bizarre behavior at the gym? | My development has a gym in its clubhouse.. I usually go around this time at night and it's always empty.. except for the past week this middle aged man has been coming here, except he doesn't work out, at all. He doesn't touch any of the machines other than sitting down on one them for 15 minutes at a time. He spends the other 15 minutes slowly walking in circles. 

Then on cue he will get a call from who I'm assuming is his wife to tell him she is coming to pick him up. He will then dump a bottle of water on his head and then when she walks in he acts like he just had the most hardcore workout ever.

I understand the gym is supposed to be a sacred place of no judgement but Ive finally had it with the awkwardness of him pacing in circles in front of me when I'm on the treadmill, I guess I couldn't contain myself and let it slip ""you know those weights aren't going to lift themselves""... I dont know why, i dont know if it was supposed to be an attempt at humor or I was actually trying to be a dick. Maybe somewhere in between. 

He gave me a very nasty look and flipped me off and now it's even more awkward. I'm writing this from the treadmill and he is staring me down. 

AITA here and it was none of my business and I should have just kept my big mouth to myself or was I warranted to call him out? Maybe I was hoping my  comment would also kick his ass into gear too.",False,False
0,"AITA for not attending my grandfathers funeral? | My grandfather passed away in early December, and while I was very saddened by his passing I chose not to attend his funeral. This is because the majority of my family is fairly spread out throughout the US, so any visits are rather costly with airfare and hotels if someone doesn't have room for my fiance and I to stay for some time. And unfortunately we're one of the many families living paycheck to paycheck, so we don't exactly have a lot of extra money to spend whenever we feel like it.

&#x200B;

So it's not that I didn't want to go, and we did have some money available, but spending it on travel costs could've likely meant that we wouldn't be able to afford our mortgage payment for the month, especially since this was around the holidays so it would've been extra expensive. Sadly this was something my mother didn't seem to understand, and she was very upset when I told her I would not be going. She was very angry with me and went on about how all my many cousins and other family members were coming, it's so selfish of me not to attend my grandfather's funeral, I'm just being cheap, she planned the funeral closer to Christmas so I could be there for the holidays and now I'm ruining her Christmas, and the like. This phone call ended with my mother in tears and hanging up on me, so of course I felt like absolute shit.

&#x200B;

The funeral came and went, I didn't attend, and my mother has barely spoken to me since our exchange over the phone - she didn't even answer my call on Christmas day. Many of my other family members shared the same sentiment as my mother, that I was selfish, cheap, etc., though none of them offered to pay my way out there. I'm very sad that I wasn't able to go to the funeral, and I'd like to think my reasoning for not going is justified, but I can't help but wonder should I have tried to do more to get there? Should I have just paid the mortgage late, or maybe return some Christmas present I'd already bought by then, and does it make me an asshole that I didn't? I'm sure my mother would say I am, and part of me does feel like maybe I didn't try hard enough, but I'm very torn.",False,False
0,"AITA for buying my daughter makeup without consulting her father | My daughter started high school this year. This all happened back in August/September.

My daughter has pretty bad acne. I spent all of middle school teaching her about skincare and encouraging her to let her skin breathe, but it didn't clear up much. I can't afford a dermatologist, but I got her a prescription acne cream from her primary doctor that helped a bit but not much. I had the same problems with my skin when I was her age and it didn't clear up until college.

She got picked on a bit for her acne in middle school, but the bullying ramped up in high school. I decided it was time to let her start experimenting with makeup, especially since so many of her peers were starting to explore makeup as well. I bought her a nice, non comedogenic foundation and let her also get a few drugstore products. I taught her the basics and she's really happy with how she looks with makeup. She watches a lot of tutorials, and while she's not the best at blending and such yet (she's also going through the black eyeliner phase), she's very happy with how she looks and she doesn't look ridiculous or anything. 

My ex visits her once every other weekend and when he saw her makeup, he lost his mind. He said she was too young and I should have consulted him. I didn't consult him because he had already refused to pitch in for a dermatologist and no matter how I tried to explain it to him, he didn't understand the impact that the bullying was having on our daughter. On top of that, he's always told me that I need to handle the ""woman things"" and I think makeup falls under that category. He told her she looked like a prostitute and that she was just going to make her skin worse.  He insisted that she throw the makeup away. I spent a decent amount on her makeup and refused. I told her not to wear the makeup around her father but she could still wear it to school and on days she didn't see him, and she agreed. When I told my partner about this, he got upset that I am hiding something from my ex. Am I the asshole for buying my daughter makeup without consulting her father and for allowing her to continue wearing make up even though I know he doesn't want her to?",False,False
0,"AITA For wanting my new girlfriend to take an STD test before we get physical? | I want to take an STD test and show her that I'm clean, and I'd want her to do the same to me.

0,"AITA for not wanting my dad to get married the weekend before me? | I have always had a really good relationship with my dad.  It is something I am very grateful for as I have several friends who cannot say the same about their own fathers. 

Unfortunately my dad went through a rough divorce from my mother a few years ago, and since then, has been very sneaky about how he spends his personal time.  While this can sometimes be very annoying, it is usually a source of laughter between me and my brother.

My dad has been dating a woman who is quite a bit younger than him.  She is much closer to my age than his.  I don’t really mind because it’s his life, not mine, but other people love to ask me how I feel about it.  This particular girlfriend tends to compete with me for my dad’s attention.  It’s always small, petty things and I try not to give it much attention because I shouldn’t have to fight for my own dad’s attention... and quite frankly, I don’t want to put him in an uncomfortable position.  I have always assumed she is more competitive with me because we are close in age.

When I got engaged, I was ecstatic and called my dad immediately. I told him my boyfriend had proposed and he responded with an underwhelming “oh okay”.  I was confused as I know my dad loves my partner but realized his girlfriend was probably nearby and he didn’t want the pressure of explaining why he hadn’t proposed to her yet. I was disappointed and felt a little bit like he tainted what is supposed to be an exciting experience. I brushed it off and set a wedding date for 13 months later.

Two weeks before my wedding, I found out from my cousin that my dad was planning to marry his girlfriend during the upcoming weekend on a vacation getaway. I felt extremely hurt that 1) he didn’t tell me and 2) he was getting married literally a week before me. I can’t even explain why I didn’t want them to get married at that time.  I just had a selfish moment and didn’t want them to “taint” another big moment of mine.  There are so many weekends they can get married... why did they have to choose the weekend just before my wedding?

I made a real effort in all my wedding planning not to be a Bridezilla in any way to anyone so I didn’t reach out to my dad. I was upset and vented to my brother.  My brother, however, flipped out and basically scared my dad into waiting another month or two.  (I wasn’t there for that conversation.)

When he got back from vacation, just before my wedding, I asked why he would want to get married at that time.  He responded that it was his girlfriend’s idea and he just wanted to make her happy.  With the amount of pettiness I’ve seen from her, it just didn’t feel like an accident or poor timing.  I told him I was very hurt he wouldn’t consider my feelings in order to please her.  Since then, I can tell he has a lot of guilt and I may have caused bad blood between us.

0,"AITA for disagreeing with my friends after they said our MTF buddy is hotter than all the girls in our group? | I have a pretty close friend group, although now I’m not too sure. We are all mid to late twenties. We’ve all been using FaceTime as a way to see and speak to one another as well as our group chat. 

One of my friends Mariah is MTF trans, and has been living her best female life for around a year now. I came with her to her appointments (so did a lot of our friends), made time to drive her to salons etc, just in general trying to be as good a person I could be and be supportive. 

she had facial surgery a couple weeks ago before everything went crazy and she’s obviously at home healing. 

She sent us all pictures and I responded with how good she looks, but another friend Sarah wrote ‘wow you’re hotter than all us girls now haha!!’ 

Everyone heavily agreed, but I felt that was demeaning to our other friends and didn’t say anything. Sarah for reasons I’m not sure of did the @(my name) sign in WhatsApp and directly asked me why I wasn’t agreeing. 

I said well, I think Mariah looks awesome but I don’t think she looks *better* than the other women, she’s just as beautiful. I thought that was the most agreeable way to show my support as well as not put anyone down. 

EVERYONE exploded at me, a lot of our male friends quite aggressively pointing out Mariah is perfect etc. I said yeah, she is, but she’s not better looking than anybody in the group. Idk man, I just felt like it was turning into a weird competition that I didn’t want to be a part of. 

3 different friends privately messaged me to say thank you, and they felt shitty about Sarah’s message- not that I was doing it for validation, but I’ve noticed most people are being super frosty with me right now and Mariah who usually has a good relationship with everyone is defo upset since she keeps throwing out passive aggressive comments directed at me.",False,False
1,"AITA for “shaming” my girlfriend into shaving her legs? | Throwaway cause my girl uses reddit and browses this sub somewhat often.

My (m22) girlfriend (23) of two years isn’t exactly the hippie, free-spirit, “my hairy body is beautiful” type but she definitely never developed the habit of shaving consistently. She says it takes a long time (she’s very tall so that makes sense for her legs), her skin is sensitive so she’s prone to bad razor burn, and she always manages to nick herself and bleed a lot. She pretty much only shaves when the hair is physically irritating her skin. It doesn’t necessarily bother me because I love her for who she is, but I do have a preference toward smooth, silky skin. Who wouldn’t, right?

Earlier this evening we were enjoying a shower together and she mentioned how she thought it was time to shave her underarms. She said the hair was starting to get on her nerves and she wanted it gone. Once she finished that up, she turned to her legs and said something along the lines of “I think these are gonna be up next soon. That hair is starting to bother me too.” Now her leg hair was LONG, and even the lightness of the strands couldn’t cover up how much was there. It was bad. So, a bit harshly and sarcastically I will admit, I said “yeah, you think it’s time to shave your legs? How long has it been?” She looked at me for a moment then started getting weepy-eyed, so I asked her what the deal was and she said “I thought it didn’t bother you that I don’t shave. It hasn’t been an issue this whole relationship and now I feel like I’m being shamed.”

I explained to her what I explained above, that I don’t care that she doesn’t shave but i still prefer touching smooth legs and underarms. She remained pretty quiet, so I started trying to coax her out of the shower so we could finish up and be done. She refused, saying that she was gonna go ahead and shave her legs. I just left the bathroom. A WHOLE ASS HALF HOUR later she emerged, presented her smooth legs to me, and has been sitting quietly since then. 

Right now I’m frustrated that she just spent 30 extra minutes making a point, I’m frustrated that she’s acting mad at me for agreeing that she should do something she already said she wanted to do, and I just have to know if I should feel bad and say sorry or if I should just let her get her moping out then move on. 

TL:DR—girlfriend said she wanted to shave her legs for once, I said that she should. Now I’m in the doghouse for “shaming” her.",False,False
1,"AITA for asking my (28F) boyfriend (29M) to call me on days we don't see each other? | My boyfriend is a great person, but we've had a few communication issues. We see each other 4-6 times a week and always get along great when we're together. However, there have been a few times, either when he's on a boy's trip or just working a lot when I've asked him to give me a call since we're not seeing each other that day and can't even talk via text.

It got to a point where I really put my foot down after feeling ignored when he went on a ski trip with friends and didn't call at all. He sent a few ""I'm so exhausted"" texts, but of course went out with his friends every night. I told him that in order for things to work we need better communication and for him to call me on days when we cannot text (cause we're busy) at all and won't see each other. I said the call can be extremely quick, it's just to say hey.

Cut to earlier this week. We don't text at all all day on Wednesday, we're both busy at work. It's around 6:30PM and I send him a text. He responds, but doesn't provide any further into. So I jokingly ask, ""are you out with your other GF?!"" (this was truly a joke, although probably a bad one). He says he's out with his boss. 

He's out with his boss until 10PM then crashes at home. I'm so angry by this point. Why can't he just give me a quick call after work or when he gets home?

So for the background, I have three dogs. It is true that because I work I have to leave them outside most of the time. Here's the thing, they never bark when I'm home. However I have this extremely rude older neighbor who will bang on my door at all hours and tell me ""your dogs barked all day long."" I tell her that they aren't barking now and she tells me that she likes to stay up at night at sleep during the day.

0,"AITA for making a first date a ""friends"" only drink immediately after seeing the girl I was there with? | Met a girl last night for the first time, we met through a dating app, her pictures show an obviously really pretty girl that I was super into, she had both face and body pictures so I figured everything was good to go and I was really looking forward to the date

&#x200B;

Come to the night and I'm getting a little worried about the date, I send her a few funny pics or me acting like a dickhead with the message ""so you know who you're looking for tonight!"" kinda hoping that she'd send one back but nothing, okay that's fine maybe she's nervous or has a reason to not want to send one back, all good with me

&#x200B;

I get to the bar where we meet and honestly I immediately thought I'd been cat fished, the girl who was there looked honestly nearly completely different from her pictures, I'm really not trying to sound shallow but she was easily 1-2 times bigger than her pictures suggested, even the full body shot she had, her face looked different, her hair, her body everything.

&#x200B;

I'm not the type of person to just walk away as she has feelings too, so we sit and chat but I guess I kinda almost immediately make it a ""friends"" vibe, I'm really not attracted to this girl and honestly felt a little hurt I guess? by the fact that this person looked so radically different to her online pictures. we have a few drinks chatting all okay, few laughs but nothing over the top and by the end of the date I can tell she's getting more and more annoyed that I'm not reciprocating any flirting going on, I notice this and decide it's time to leave, we hug, get in separate taxis and haven't spoken since.

&#x200B;

I guess my point is that I felt a little betrayed that this person portrayed such a different image of herself online to what she looked like in real life and so that reflected in me during our date, but I've always been brought up to treat people the way I'd like to be treated and I can't imagine going on a date with someone who's just made it a big friend zone is all that great an experience so I'm torn between whether I'm an asshole for acting the way I did, or she's an asshole for leading me on under false pretenses

0,"AITA for telling my ex girlfriend that her kids can’t play on my sons PS4 anymore? | My son is 13, my ex gf ‘told me’ to buy him a PS4 for his birthday last year. She’s a piece of work so anything going into her house for my son she enjoys telling me what I can and can’t get for him. But since she ok’d the PS4 I purchased one so my son could play at his moms house cuz I wanted to get him one anyway. 

Now she has 4 other kids and since then I’ve been billed like $7.99 or $12.99 or whatever, little amounts on psn store over time. I assumed it was my son and kept forgetting to ask him until October this year when I asked and he said he had no idea. Turns out it was his little brothers doing it. 

I spoke directly to his mom and asked if she would supervise them since it’s easy for me to keep my card on there and if she’d just make sure they didn’t make unauthorized purchases. 

However on the 20th December I saw another transaction. I checked with my son and found out it was his brothers again. I called my ex up and told her that her kids are no longer allowed to play on it. I told her if they are I’ll be taking it back so my son can play with it here.

I will admit, I am pretty much tone deaf, and my friends won't let me hear the end of it.

Since the recent worldly problems, I have been living at home with my parents and family again. I really didn't want to come back here, but they begged me to, so here I am.

I went to complain to my parents and they both looked at each other and said ""you're not exactly the best singer you know"". Ok yes, I know but hearing them say it like that really made me mad.

I only take showers for like 10 minutes every other night, so it's not even that big of a deal for me to just enjoy myself for such a short amount of time.

I felt he should have given me warning so I decided to give him the same treatment back and go quiet. He messages me a few more times that night but I ignored it. Eventually I told him to stop messaging me but he replied with:

>""You agreed to meet with me and stood me up. Carn that's a low blow! I'm entitled to some warning or an apology for wasting my time.""

I just told him to check his behaviour and that he wasn't entitled to anything. I'm thinking of screencapping the exchange and posting it online so that mutual friends can see how he behaves.

My sister and friends agree that I was well within my rights to bail and don't owe him anything. But would shaming him be to far?",False,False
0,"AITA for my joke with my son and for posting it on Facebook | My son was a premie and I don’t want to get too specific but his birth almost killed me. I told him about this when he was growing up. When he was 13 or so, he accidentally tripped me and I said “you tried to kill me when you came out and you haven’t stopped trying!” Since then it became a joke between us whenever he accidentally hit me (happened a lot because he likes to rough house with his brother...). 

For my sons graduation, I posted a photo of him as a baby and another from today and wrote, “congratulations ____, you tried to kill me when you were born and you haven’t stopped trying! Still so proud of you!” My son “love” reacted to it but his father called me and yelled at me and accused me of being over dramatic and guilting our son. I explained it was a running joke, but he freaked out at me for “damaging” him by telling him about his birth as a child. His mother also texted me a similar complaint.

0,"AITA for not wanting to participate in our for-profit, limited liability company's fundraising events with my own money? | ""George, I have noticed you hadn't bought a single raffle ticket yet. Go on, they're only a pound, for a chance to win 50!"", my manager asked me today.

""Oh. It's because I don't approve of gambling, Sarah"", I responded, as it was the first excuse that popped into my mind. I thought it would be enough for her not to push the subject any further. I was wrong.

""It's not gambling! It's a raffle! The remainder of the money raised goes into the Resident Support Fund. It directly benefits our home's Residents"", the manager replied.

Let's pause for a bit. Our company owns about 40 nursing homes across England. It's an LTD, so the financial statements are not a secret. Last year, they reported a profit of over £2.5M. Yet about 80% of our staff, especially the carers, are making just a fraction above national minimum wage. If you're not a manager on a contract, there's no bonuses. The staff are charged for everything - from uniforms to lunches.

Being a resident of a nursing home isn't cheap either. It costs more per week than I make in a month.

And what is the Resident Support Fund? Sometimes we throw parties, sometimes we get a new telly for the lounge, sometimes we do some re-furbishing. Pretty much standard business costs in the care industry that should be covered with our Clients' hard-earned money. Yet apparently they aren't - and we need to supplement it. But she must've known all that. So instead of trying the reasonable approach, this is what came out of my mouth:

""That's nice. I wish Sainsbury's employees had a Shopper Support Fund. Why don't they all chip in? Don't they realise it would directly benefit us, the paying customers?"" - I realised how passive-aggressive and stand-offish it sounded the second I responded. Sarcasm is the default dialogue option for a Brit. Its how communicate, but I fully own the fact that it could've been perceived as uncalled for.

Suffice to say, Sarah wasn't pleased. Other people overheard my apparent insubordination. Monday week, I have a meeting with her, the deputy and the HR lady. I highly doubt the meeting is going to be about the ethical quandaries of pressuring low-paid staff into giving back the money to their employer. I have a feeling it's going to be about ""teamwork"", ""going the extra mile"", ""charity"", ""work spirit"" and ""we're all in this together"".

Obviously, that's just my point of view. I haven't got the faintest clue how it looked from the manager's perspective. She's the one that has to answer to the Regional Manager and the CEO, after all.

Feel free to ask anything. Don't know if it matters, but I'm 30, male, and I'm the Social Activities Conductor. Arts n Crafts, Bingo, quizzes, outings, booking entertainers, throwing b-day parties, doing the newsletter, that sort of thing (I have a separate budget for all that). It's not about the money. It's a matter of principle.

0,"AITA for breaking up for my girlfriend because her mental issues made me feel useless | In 8th grade I asked a shy, quiet girl out and she said yes. Looking back on it now it was something I jumped into too soon as I really didn’t know her all that much. Things went smoothly for the first year and then things started to go downhill.

This girl had some pretty bad social and mental issues (social anxiety, depression of some degree, and even lived in a not so supporting household). This led to her being a girl who kept to herself mostly, even from her boyfriend. It would be a journey just to find her in the morning, as she didn’t have a phone.

Then her problems got worse, to the point of her cutting herself. This is when she completely separated herself from everyone, including me. She would barely talk to me and seeing her so broken and hurt made me as a boyfriend feel useless and pathetic. 

I felt horrible that I couldn’t help her. She was very much in a bad place and there was nothing I could do.  I wanted her to be able to find someone who could help her with her issues.

With us being so separated, I started losing the feelings for her I used to have and started getting feelings for another girl who shared feelings back. It was a feeling I missed. 

After a month of this, I told my current girlfriend that I wanted to end our relationship and told her that I was losing feelings and that I felt that she needed to find someone who could actually help her with her problems. This went over like a car on bricks.

Immediately, word went round that I left her for another girl and that I broke up with her because of her mental issues. People HATED me. They didn’t know my side of the story and didn’t bother to find out. The took the word of the innocent, shy girl.

Three months later and that girl is more social than she ever was. She’s actually talking to people in our school. So i don’t know if I was holding her back or if she just randomly became social. 

So the question is Am I The Asshole that everyone thinks I still am?",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my dad I'm not sticking around? | My parents separated when I was pretty young and my mom was awarded full custody. My father wanted to stay in my life at first, but the courts ruled in favor of my mom controlling visitation until he found a place to live and got a job. He was really bad off back then, and my mom was at least able to make bills. Instead of getting his act together, my father never tried to get involved with me again until recently when my mom died and he accepted custody. He has a house, a job, a GF, and she has a little boy. All living together.

I didn't have to move out of state or anything, but it's a good distance from where I've lived my whole life and my best friend was still willing to take the time and gas to come see me. When he got here, my dad was very standoffish and when he left I was told I wasn't allowed to interact at with him at all anymore. I'm sure it's because he's a year older, has face piercings and some tattoos, and does weird styles and colors with his hair. My dad went so far as to lock my social media so I can have no contact.

But my best friend is like my *best friend.* We've been through a lot-we grew up poor, we've had our fair share of bullying and family problems. I love my mom, but she wasn't perfect and there was a lot of shit to work through. He is a great guy who's always stood by me, and my dad dismissed him solely on his appearance. I got pissed and told my dad not to expect me to be around in a year when I turn eighteen, and his girlfriend told me I should be ashamed for using that as blackmail. To me, if it's a choice between dad or best friend, I'm going with the guy who has been there with me the whole way.

0,"AITA for being annoyed at being woken up early? | I’m home from college for spring break and I have to sleep in the guest room, which has my moms exercise bike in it. This morning, she woke up to use it at 8am (I was planning on getting up around 10-10:30 and working this afternoon). The bike itself was quiet but I could hear her panting and breathing which woke me up, and then it was obviously super uncomfortable to try and go back to sleep only to hear panting two feet away. I got kinda pissed at my mom and asked her a few times why she couldn’t just do it later and then when I got up to leave she started screaming at me and threatened to kick me out, lol. Anyway, AITA for complaining about her using her exercise bike in the room I have to sleep in at 8am?

1,"AITA because my kid makes noise? | For the past 2 years I’ve lived with my husband in a multi family dwelling. We brought our baby home almost a year ago. 

The building is a larger house that has been sectioned off into 3 entirely separate suites, all with separate entrances. My family lives on the mainfloor. Last summer a middle aged, child free couple moved into the upper suite. Im the basement suite lives a single, child free man in his 50’s and he has been living here for 6 years before us. 

Things we do that make noise:

Our child: 
He is almost 1 year old. He sleeps and makes 0 noise from 7:30pm-7:30am. Once in a while he might wake up crying from a bad dream but that’s rare. During the day we play with musical instruments, sing, laugh, play with building blocks... all those things make noise. Sometimes he yells just for fun. Other times he yells to get my attention if I’m busy or if I’m not getting his snack quickly enough. Or he may yell in to getting his diaper changed. Sometimes he falls and hurts himself which results in loud wailing cries until he calms down again. He’s an average kid and makes an average amount of kid noise.

My husband and myself: 
We watch tv in the evening but in the 2 years we’ve lived here we’ve never had a single complaint about the volume of our television... we keep it reasonable and we’re mindful of the volume. We also talk and laugh with each other. Sometimes we accidentally drop things on the floor and that makes noise.... sometimes we also use the vacuum cleaner during the daytime which can get quite loud. 


The event that triggered this situation: 

At around 11pm the other night my husband dropped an empty piece of Tupperware on the floor while he was making his lunch for work. The lower neighbour banged on the wall and yelled in protest to the noise caused by dropping the empty plastic container. 

The following day, my husband was outside smoking weed (it’s legal in our country) and our lower neighbour walked by... my husband initiated conversation to discuss what happened when our neighbour proceeded to aggressively walk toward and yell at my husband about how selfish we are, how we are always so noisy and he’s sick of it, how we only think of ourselves and how the upstairs neighbours hate us too and are also sick of our noise and how none of them want to live here because of us and it’s impossible to take a nap in the afternoon. My husband was calm and continued to try for a calm and respectable conversation but the lower neighbour continued to be aggressive, talk over him, and only wanted to yell at and insult us. So my husband said “this conversation is over now. Go away.” The lower neighbour was still yelling and talking over him but my husband kept saying “bye. Go away. Bye. Go away.” Until he left. 

Since then we purchased some nice earplugs on amazon and had them sent to our lower neighbour with a gift card that says “for your afternoon naps. kind regards- mainfloor neighbours”

I was already thinking about moving closer to my job and to have my own place since I can now afford it. I was waiting for the right place and for the lease to expire. I pay most of the rent since I have the master and my own bedroom. Recently, both roommates lost their jobs and it terrifies me to think about being stuck with two deadbeat roommates. I spoke to the property manager and she said I could be released from the lease by surrendering the security deposit plus one month's rent. However, I have a good relationship with her and has a couple places that she will rent to me that are available right now. 

By leaving early, my roommates have to move out. They can try to lease it themselves but with they have no job and couldn't afford it even when they were working. They assume that if I were to leave it wouldn't be until summer, not 28 days. Sticking around is not in my interest.",False,False

0,"AITA For Not Wanting To Pay For a BDay Party I Cant Go To? | I have a friend (Amanda) and her best friend is Lexi. I don’t know Lexi that well, but Amanda has become a good friend of mine over time. Lexi texted me out of the blue asking if I could help plan Amanda’s surprise party. Of course I said yes. Lexi started throwing out dates, one of which was a week and a half away and also fell on the same night as my good friend John’s birthday party. (For clarity let’s say it was a Friday) I told her that most of Amanda and I’s friends, including Amanda herself, were invited and already RSVP’d to Johns BDay which had been planned for weeks. Lexi said okay and we decided on a later date. 

Cut to Monday. Lexi texts me and says we’re going to have the party on Friday. I reminded her that John’s BDay party is that day, and she asked me if people would be willing to do half and half? I responded with how that wouldn’t be fair in general, but especially less than a week away. Lexi never responded to me. Lexi went to the Facebook group and made a poll about which days would be better, including Friday. And the other day she suggested was one that I had already told her I personally couldn’t make. Multiple people responded to it saying ‘that’s John’s birthday party’ and she just ignored it. Lexi posted she was going to make reservations that night and needed a headcount. 

Cut to today, where she posts that she made a reservation for Saturday, because ‘people voted on it’. And I can’t go. Whatever it’s just a birthday party. But then Lexi starts asking me for money to put toward the reservation and the cake and everything else. I told her no, I’m not going to be there and I told her ahead of time the dates that didn’t work. Apparently that makes me a ‘selfish bitch who doesn’t care about my friend’. Lexi keeps saying I was helping her plan the party so I’m partially responsible for it no matter what. And I don’t agree? AITA?

0,"AITA for being “cheap” with GF (30) | Me & my gf of 3 years has accused me of being cheap. She has 2 children from a previous relationship. Everything in the relationship is great but money is the elephant in the room. 

We both have income. For the most part it’s kept separate. Separate bank accounts etc. All bills are 50/50. Now I’ve noticed when we all go out to eat etc she expects me to pay. The bills are always higher because of the kids. I find myself not wanting to go out because it gets too expensive. 

I have money saved. A mortgage from before we got together. Investments and own my own company. No debts. She is coming from a relationship where they had 30-40k debt. 
Has had the ex pay it off in the divorce. She has a vehicle and wants me to help out on repairs, new tires etc. Even maybe help buy a new vehicle. I drive a 20 year old vehicle and have never owned a new one. I see it as a bad investment. 

She earns more money than I do. She doesn’t work but gets payments from the ex for the kids. She says she doesn’t want anything to do with him and would rather not take his money but wants me to basically take over. I don’t have the money to do this. Also I did not expect this. Now it’s turning into “we are not a priority for you”. And you keep all your money. Meanwhile I feel like everything is fair 50/50 with her even earning more. She earns about 2x me. Now her cards are maxed out and it’s getting stressful. She wants me to buy the bday gifts, vacations etc. Now tells me that’s how her other relationship was. But my defence is I am not the father and he is still alive and making payments. So idk, she’s made me feel like I’m cheap and don’t contribute. Is this a controlling tactic to get what she wants?

1,"AITA for not giving my friend a ride home? | So last Friday my friend and I went to a concert. We both live downtown and our area is a high crime area. During the day the area is not so bad. So I wanted us to both walks to the concert during the daylight. She told me that she was walking but that she would meet me there because she was already out and she needed to drop off something with her cousin who works close to the venue. I was a little annoyed because I wanted to walk into the concert together and showing up alone 5 mins before her was embarrassing to me. She was kind of annoying the whole night saying that she didn't want to get too drunk etc., when the whole point was to go out and have fun.

&#x200B;

 The concert ended around 12:30 am and then we ran into her friends who wanted to go to a diner down the street for sober up food. I was completely sober at this point and not having any fun. She and her friends have boyfriends and husbands who are all friends and were currently on an out of trip state to vegas. They were making tons of stupid jokes saying that their boyfriends are probably all in bed right now because they act like old men and we are still out and blah blah blah. My boyfriend had just dumped me so I didn't like listening to them talk about their boyfriends. Just to stress this, they were being very annoying. 

&#x200B;

So after all this is over her friend asked us how we got here and I told her we walked. She offered to drive us home but I literally couldn't stand being around them anymore and I said I would just walk home. My friend said she didn't like that and she was worried, because it was so late and because of the crime rate. I insisted that I just wanted to walk home and my friend said she'd walk with me because of the time. She then said we could just take an uber me and her back to my house and then she would stay in it until her house. I didn't want to pay for that and her phone was almost dead. We just walked. Once we got back to my house she asked if I could give her a ride back her house, which is literally about a 10 min walk and maybe a 3 min drive. I was too annoyed and told her I was tired and walked to go to bed she then asked if she could charge her phone at my house for a bit so she could call an uber. FOR LITERALLY WHAT WAS ABOUT A 3 MIN DRIVE!!! She said she didn't want to walk home because the area is dangerous and the homeless sleep in the park down the street. I thought that was messed up. I told her I just wanted to go to bed and I said goodnight and went back inside. So on her way home she walked by a motel and was grouped by a man who thought she was a prostitute and tried to get her into his truck. Another man saw this happen and ran over to help her and then he called the police and waited with her. All of our mutual friends are mad at me but when I said no, I meant no.

And for some reason she was super pissed, said that I should have told her about it first and we could have made the decision together and said I'm an asshole for not consulting her on a major purchase like this etc. We don't live together but we are talking about that and have been together for 2 years.

0,"AITA for not wanting to pay my preschools full tuition? | So we just got notice that our preschool is going to stay closed through May 4th. They‘ve asked all parents to continue to pay tuition so that they can pay the teachers, rent, and other workers that are not working. Tuition is normally $1500 a month per child and does not include any food. They’ve started doing daily zoom classes for 30 mins but as all the kids are 5 and under, no one is really sitting for it, especially not my kids. There’s also some workbooks they’ve emailed. 

My husband and I also work full time (remotely) right now and have demanding jobs. At min I’ve been working 10+ hours a day and 6-7 hours of my day are spent on conference calls. Having our 3 kids at home with us has been difficult since we physically need to watch them as they’re all under 5 and not exact self sufficient. I don’t mind paying some of the tuition however, I don’t believe it’s fair for them to ask us to continue to pay $4500 a month for childcare we are not receiving. We pay that much for someone to take care of our kids during the day so that we can work. We don’t pay that much to have them set up a 30 online class and some workbook that we have to be present for. we already paid for March (and they haven’t been to school this entire month) and we’ve already prepaid for The entire month of June even though they’re only in school for the first week. They usually have 90-100 kids enrolled at the school (4 classes). That means that they bring in 135-150k a month. I sincerely doubt they aren’t making some sort of profit at that rate and I think it’s pretty greedy of them to want parents to continue to pay the same rate through the remainder of the school year instead of prorating the amount to something that would just sustain the closed school until they open it back up. 

There have been some parents who are on the “we should continue to pay so that the teachers can get paid” boat but those parents only pay for one child. I would be fine with paying $1500 a month to help them pay their Teachers. I do not believe they would feel like same if they were paying $4500 like we are. There’s are other sets of parents that have two kids in the school (were the only ones with 3) and they’ve reached out to me stating that they feel like it’s unfair to ask us to continue to pay that much.

I don't know the details and wether or not he asked me the day of her death. 
The place we work, schedules us 1 week in advanced every Tuesday so he has known his schedule for at least a week prior to the day he asked me. Our work offers us the option to work part of our shift and have someone come in and cover the rest of their shift if there is someone available to do so via our employee attendance system online. For the schedule my co-worker is on that day he would have an answer by 4pm whether it be a yes or no for someone to cover him. My thinking is that he put in for a partial shift request but no one was available so he started texting people to ask if they can come in. Me being one of them. My co-worker texted me asking if I can come in so he can attend his sister's memorial at 7:30pm (paraphrasing but pretty much the gist of the message)

0,"WIBTA if I don't write my absent father a letter praising him? | This is not my story, it's about a friend of mine who does not have a Reddit account. I don't know if it's valid to post it.

I  have a close friend, whose father got her mom pregnant, and then  basically forgot about them. The guy had 4 kids with 4 different women,  and got married 3 times (the only one he did not marry was the mom of my  friend).

During her first 20 or  so years on earth, her father only met her twice (once was on her 11th  birthday and he had forgot about it, it was just a coincidence) and he  did not pay any alimony for her, no rent support, not sending groceries  once in a while, nothing at all.

When  she was in her early twenties, one of her half-brothers was diagnosed  with Acute Myeloid Leukemia, and he needed marrow transplants and blood  donations for the treatment. The issue was that the only close relative  with the same blood type was her, so she was the best possible donor.  Now, after all these years, her father looked for her, and told her that  her brother needed her help. So, she went overseas to the hospital  where his brother was being treated **(the  treatment cost millions of dollars, and he paid for it, which meant  that the guy was not exactly poor and could have supported her, at least  financially),** and did everything that was asked from her to  help her brother recover, she did not attend university for a year, she  took care of her brother, but unfortunately the kid died. She did this  out of human decency, not expecting any kind of money or retribution.

After  all this, her father paid the remaining tuition towards her university  degree (3 years or so), and told her that he would pay for any  additional education that she wanted to get. So, 8 years later, he paid  for her Masters program tuition fee (I think it's a 4-digit figure, it's  in Europe). **During the last decade, they have only talked twice or thrice a year (Birthdays and New Year's eve)**

Now,  her father and all his family are going on a cruise, and they did not  invite her. They planned everything in April, they leave next week, and  yesterday her older brother told her ""Hey, we are going on a cruise with  my dad, and we are making a homage for him. Could you please write a  letter to him thanking him for being such a good father and for all he  has done for us?""

She told me that  she didn't have any kind of inspiration (of course) and asked me to help her  writing the letter. I told her that I would not do it, because her  father does not deserve any kind of homage or letter from her. Her  answer was that she does not want to behave like  an asshole with her dad and brother, and that her dad paid for her tertiary education.

Would she be the asshole if she ignores her brother's request and not write any kind of letter to her dad, considering that at least he paid for most of her Bachelor's and her Master's tuition fees?",False,False
0,"AITA for getting mad at my GF for grinding on a gay guy? | About two weeks ago my GF of 5 years went out for her friends birthday and took a party bus with another group of guys who were also celebrating a birthday.

As I’m looking through Snapchat, I see a story from one of her friends and it’s my girlfriend bent over, grinding on another guy. Obviously, I was shocked and waited until the next day to talk to her. 

The next day she could tell I was upset but she said nothing about the video (even though her friend took it down at some point between the night and morning) and acted like she had no idea. I eventually told her why I was upset and she proceeded to say the guy she was dancing with was gay. While this was *somewhat* of a relief, I was still upset and frankly embarrassed. This video was posted for everyone to see and I have no idea how many people saw the video and assumed the worst.

She half-heartedly apologized but whenever it’s brought up, she acts like it doesn’t matter since he was gay. 

Im not a possessive or controlling BF, but I found it pretty disturbing that my GF of 5 years (who is also pushing for marriage) was out, borderline blackout drunk, and dancing on other guys. Again, this was not friendly dancing with her gay friend, this was fully bent over grinding on him.

0,"AITA for giving my cats away for my sick girlfriend? | Okay so I have two cats that were formerly fosters. Long and short of how they came to stay was: Boo (the older cat) came to live with me as a very very sick kitten so she would have a comfy place to pass on, instead she got better and has been with me for four years. Coco I found this summer on a bike ride, as tiny as kittens come, brought her home and took care of her. Was going to rehome her but my girlfriend grew attached and we kept her. Both are super cuddly and affectionate, and are adored by everyone who comes over. 

Fast forward to a recently. My girlfriend of almost two years has had aggressive diabetes since she was born, and was recently told she has 10% kidney function and will have to go in dialysis, and she's only 25. Her failing kidneys meant aaaallooottttt of dietary restrictions, including Claritin. She's allergic to cats and has had to take a pill or two just to come hang out when we started dating, otherwise she looks like a bee stung her and she's barely comfortable in her own skin. So with the news, I decided I'd rehome my cats, letting them go live with my recently widowed step mom and my two little sisters (this way they'll be loved, my family will have a li'l happiness in a shitty time, and I can see them whenever I want). The girlfriend was racked with guilt and has been depressed already with all the changes we're making over her health.
I told my friends over group chat about the cats leaving and why and they were more upset over me giving away the cats than over my girlfriends predicament, especially one girl in particular who kept making it sound as though I was personally killing the cats ""for some chick"" . Two days ago was our roommates birthday and that same girl got a card that said ""happy birthday teddy bear, sorry straightupforrealtho is killing your favourite cat (boo) just for his girlfriend"". My girlfriend was heart broken and embarrassed , especially since she spent the day cleaning the house and baking a cake and decorating just for everyone to have fun.

 I'm really trying to do the best I can for both my cats and my girlfriend, but am I the asshole here? Cause my friends are making it seem that way. ",False,False
1,"AITA for getting mad at my husband for not telling me about a late work meeting? | My husband has a very high stress job.   I quit my dream job to help support him and moved to another country  with our three kids for this job of his.  I’m slightly resentful of this at times.  I openly admit it. This is why I’m asking for strangers advice as to whether I’m a complete asshole about this sitch.  

He  has late night meetings sporadically because head office is in a different time zone.  Most of the time he’s pretty good about letting me know ahead of time.  Some times he’s not so good about it and I am bothered by it. 

Sunday (yesterday) evening I asked him what time he would be home because I had a group of my son’s friends coming over to play after school and for dinner.  He offhandedly mentions that he has a late night meeting and won’t be home before 10 pm.  I asked him how long he knew about this and he said he’s not sure - he forgot to mention it.  

I told him that it really bothers me when he doesn’t consider my time to be important.  It makes me feel like I’m the hired help that will just go along with his schedule regardless of my needs and the needs of our family.  It bothers me in so many ways that I can’t quite articulate.  

He accused me of not being supportive of his hard job.  We’ve had this conversation before and it never ends well

To keep the peace, I kept most of my feelings to myself and have just been inwardly upset and bothered by it.  Who’s the asshole Reddit?  Or are we both? ",False,False
1,"AITA for blaming my mom about issues between her and dad? | My mom and dad divorced seven months ago because of religious differences and issues. In June last year, it escalated significantly between them and dad divorced her. They divorced because my dad planned to marry a second wife, as a Muslim he has that right, but it was something that my mother refused. She wasn't having it and that's when he divorced her.

My dad is a religious fanatic, and he has been the same person ever since Iran, before we came to America more than a decade ago. My mom on the other hand, is not a religious person, she never cared about Islam or what it stands for. Dad left mom, even though she cried and apologized for making him angry, (she hadn't done anything wrong) dad was selfish and left.

I was going on a vacation with friends during the summer and would be back home in September. Mom didn't want to stay alone, she asked me to rent one of the rooms in our house to Jeffrey, because she wanted to have company, especially when I was away. Jeffrey is a 23 year old guy from our neighborhood, he has always lived here, I'm not a close friend of the guy but I know him.

At first I was a little unsure considering that he doesn't have such a good reputation and have been imprisoned several times (not lately), but I listened to mom and gave him a room in the house. I had no other option because he was the only one seeking a room to rent in our small neighborhood, because he was crashing at his friends house.

When I got back from my vacation, I found out that my mom and Jeffrey have been dating since June, just a few days after I left. I was shocked and didn't know how to react. Barely a week ago my dad came back and wanted to remarry mom, (unaware that she was in a relationship) she accepted and broke up with Jeffrey. When he found out about Jeffrey, hell broke out. He's blaming mom for treason and cheating.

I didn't support the relationship my mom had with Jeffrey, but I didn't want to stand in her way. My dad is going crazy and has been since he found out. I'm pleased to see mom and dad as a couple again, but dad is more insane than ever. I blame mom on this one because in my judgement she rushed a little bit too fast and started dating after dad, I know she was divorced at the time, but i happened so fast.

0,"AITA for insisting my GF get a flu shot? | I (26M) am insisting my GF (27F) get a flu shot. For starters, she works with kids and frankly I’m surprised she’s not required to get one as part of her job. Second, my mom is on an immunosuppressant that makes here more susceptible to getting contagious illnesses like the flu. My girlfriend spends a significant amount of time with my family, especially my mom.

My GF is opposed to getting one because the two times in the past she’s gotten a flu shot (I have trouble believing she’s only had a flu shot twice) she’s wound up getting the flu later that flu season. She’s convinced the flu shot caused her to get the flu both of those times.

I have explained to her that flu shots use a dead version of the virus, and that the dead virus can’t cause the flu.

I have also explained flu shots are not always perfect. There are different strands and pharmaceutical companies are giving it their best guess as to which strain will be prevalent in a given year. So if you got the flu after getting the vaccine, it’s because they wound up getting the prediction wrong.

She doesn’t believe me and is rather insistent that the vaccine caused the flu, and therefore she not get the vaccine. I’ve told her to ask a doctor friend of hers and she refuses. So we’re at an impasse. AITA for not budging.

Also, she gets vitamin shots so it’s not like she has a fear of needles.",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my sister to shut up about her acne? | Throwaway account bc I like keeping my shit separate.

So I (18F) have a sister (15F) who means the world to me.  I say this to set the precedent that I don't bear any resentment towards her, it's just this situation.

Long story short: Had a skin condition that caused ugly cystic acne. This and untreated depression/anxiety made my early teens a spiral of self-hatred and frequent manic episodes of screaming, sobbing, and locking myself away so no one could see how ""hideous"" I was. I put chemicals on my face, refused to let my own family see me. A mess.

I  got treated for this and it got better.  I still have worse skin than my peers, but nothing like what it was, and my own appearance isnt a trigger anymore. Still, it can be a bit touchy.

My sister has  perfect skin, like natural foundation. We actually clown each other back and forth about it: She'll tease me about being jealous and having a ""54 step routine"" and I tell her I'll be the one laughing when we're 60 and she looks like a prune.

Recently she's been having skin troubles. Have you ever gotten those little red irritation bumps? She has 1, on her forehead. She has been complaining... a lot. Like, a lot a lot. Every time she sees a mirror she starts talking to me about how ""gross"" her skin is being and how she's ""so broken out"". 

At first I sort of just laughed and gave a sarcastic ""Haha that's my skin on a good day"" because yeah. My skin when it's doing great doesnt look as good as this ""gross, broken out mess"" she's describing. Though afterwards, I did tell her seriously that pimples like that are pretty normal, and she looks fine.

But she won't stop. It's every day. She's not even asking for advice on taking care of it: She just wants to tell me how broken out and nasty her skin looks because she has one pimple. 

 Yesterday night when she started for the 80th time I just rolled my eyes and didnt respond (I didn't think she was looking at me) and she got really upset.

 She said she didn't know why I always did this, and that I was being really insensitive. I told her I just thought she was being a bit silly over one pimple, and that it was impossible for me to not get a little upset, considering how bad my skin is in comparison. She got even more pissed, and said ""Just because my skin is better than yours doesnt mean I'm not allowed to have problems!""

I told her  I knew that, but that I couldn't help feeling uncomfortable when she made such a big deal over 1 pimple, considering she *saw* my past issues with my skin. She said I was being oversensitive and needed to stop being self-centered.

 I'm past all of the self-loathing, but listening to this still annoys me and makes me think ""what the fuck does she think of my skin?"". I *know* that she is allowed to have skin problems, and that she can be upset by them, it's just how dramatic she is being, considering how small it is.

1,"AITA for saying my friend’s baby is ugly? |   

So my friend Caroline just gave birth a few weeks ago and understandably she’s super excited. She would constantly post pictures onto Instagram and the group chat and we’re all so happy for her. Everyone is telling her that her baby is super cute but the thing is, I think this baby is the ugliest baby I have ever seen. Of course I wouldn’t tell her this as it is just my opinion (and kind of rude) but I don’t have the heart to join in the chorus of “aw he’s so cute!” so I just don’t say anything. 

&#x200B;

This was all fine and dandy until Caroline invited all of us to her place to meet the baby for the first time. I showed up a bit earlier than everyone else so it was just me, Caroline, her husband Lucas, and the baby. I was hanging out in the living room with Caroline and she had just finished feeding the baby when she asked me if I wanted to hold him. I said sure and took him from my friend and started playing and cooing him. I like making fun of babies (to the baby) and I got a bit carried away when I said to him “Oh my gosh, who is the ugliest baby, you’re the ugliest baby!” as I blew kisses into his tummy. Caroline instantly grabbed him from my arms and asked, “What did you call my baby?” I sheepishly said that I was calling him ugly and I apologized repeatedly as she screamed at me for calling her baby ugly. Lucas then comes in and asks what all the commotion was about and Caroline tells him that I had called their baby ugly and she wants me to leave. Lucas then tells me that it would be best that I left so I left as I didn’t want to make a big commotion. Later on, my other friends call me and asks why was Caroline upset when they got there and why I wasn’t there so I told them what happened and they told me that I was a jerk and rude and no wonder I got kicked out. 

I feel like maybe I went too far and should’ve hid my true feelings about the baby.

1,"AITA for snapping at my boyfriend’s daughter? | My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half. He let me know early on that he has a daughter from a previous relationship that he has full custody of (his daughter’s mother is nowhere in the picture and never has been).

We’re both guys (not relevant), and his daughter is 14.

I was introduced to his daughter 6 months into our relationship. She’s never really liked me.

I’d try to be nice to her and talk to her but she never really responded to me.

My boyfriend said that she’s a little shy, and he asked me to be patient with her.

She ignored me for a while and then she started to be very rude. She would make offhanded comments about me, insult me, and told me that I was “using” her dad (?). She made a lot of baseless assumptions that weren’t true.

My boyfriend never took any disciplinary steps. He only ever explained why what she said was inappropriate / mean and that she shouldn’t say things like that, but he’s never asked her to apologize to me and he’s never grounded her.

When I approached my boyfriend about the issue, he said that his daughter was having issues coping with another person (me) being in the equation, as its only really been him and her for a majority of her life. (She sees a therapist for her issues).

I’ve had to put up with the constant insults and accusations for a year. I don’t care that she doesn’t like me, but it was getting tiring.

It happened again last night. I was having dinner with them at my boyfriend’s place and she made another offhanded comment.

I snapped and told her that her dad was likely to abandon her or something if she kept trying to push everyone else away from him and keep him to herself, that he won’t be able to put up with her forever and that she should just get over herself.

She started crying and then she went up to her room. I hadn’t intended to make her cry or anything (and I kinda feel bad for that), but I didn’t know how else to get my point across in a way that she would understand.

I’ve never seen my boyfriend get upset before that moment. He asked what was wrong with me, and told me what I said was uncalled for. I told him that it *wasn’t* because she had been provoking me for a year now. It was bound to happen.

This was probably unnecessary, but it was a heat of the moment, and I told him that her awful behavior was his fault because he does nothing to fix it, and that he should stop sheltering her so much because she really needs to grow up.

He told me that I was being childish and he went upstairs to comfort his daughter. I ended up just going home after that, and he hasn’t responded to any of my texts yet. It’s almost been 24 hours.

Maybe I didn’t have to be so harsh, but I really didn’t want to be disrespected anymore. I’ve considered sending an apology to my boyfriend, but I feel like an apology isn’t necessary if I was right. AITA?",False,False

I rolled down my window, called him over, and asked him if he was *Claire and Rob's* tenant. I changed the names to see if he'd lie. He said yes, he was their tenant and off he went, back through their backyard gate and presumably inside.

I called 911. He mixed up their names so I thought he was an intruder. Cops came, guns drawn, and told him to vacate the house. It was a spectacle. In all of this, my neighbors were phoned and apparently he is their tenant, he had just forgotten their names.

So a couple of days ago I (40M) was watching TV on in the living room when my daughter came to me looking miserable. I asked her what's wrong and she said that she had broken up with his boyfriend of 6 months, who we'll call Brad. I asked her if she was sad because of her breakup with Brad, and she answered that she is feeling really down. I had told her in the beginning of their relationship that teen relationships don't last and that she shouldn't be upset when they inevitably break up. 

I knew that what i was about to say might hurt her initially, but i also knew that it would help her in the future: I told her that i didn't care and neither should she, because teenage relationships aren't real relationships and they never last. She got visibly upset and asked me ""Aren't you supposed to cheer me up?"" I got a little upset too, because i didn't want to make her sadder than she already was, but i stayed in my descision of teaching her about teenage relationships. I answered that i'm not going to comfort her this time, because she needs to learn the lesson about teenage realtionships and their uselessness the hard way.

1,"AITA for ignoring my son for three days as punishment? | A couple months ago, I sent my son (15M) to spend a long weekend with his aunt and cousin. His cousin (9M) is a very talkative, bubbly child, with a tendency to speak at length about his favorite topics. I wasn't there, of course, but after my son came home my sister called me. She said that, after my son had left her house, her son had told her that, whenever she hadn't been in the room, my son had deliberately ignored him. He'd talk to him, and get absolutely no reply. Apparently, my son wouldn't look at him at all. He'd pretend his cousin didn't exist. 

I asked my son about this, and he admitted that he found his cousin ""very annoying"" and said that he ""thought that if he ignored him he might finally shut up."" I was beyond horrified. I couldn't believe he would treat a member of his family this way. 

To punish him, his father and I ""ignored"" him for three days – the same length of time he'd been with my sister – to show him how unpleasant it was when people pretend you don't exist. We didn't speak to him, we didn't cook for him (though there was plenty of food in the house, and he had no trouble feeding himself), we generally pretended he wasn't there. After the punishment ended, I had him write a letter to his cousin apologizing. I thought this was fair – it wasn't a particularly long punishment, and it wasn't like he didn't have other people to talk to, and I thought he deserved something fairly harsh for how awfully he treated his cousin. After the punishment ended, we had a long discussion about respecting others, and how bullying isn't to be tolerated, and then we moved on. My son's been fine since then.

The other day, however, I mentioned this story to a friend of mine and she was disgusted by my and my husband's form of punishment. She said that it amounted to extreme mistreatment of a child. I think she's being overdramatic, and even my son agrees that it wasn't that bad. After all, once he realized we weren't talking to him, he mostly just ignored us back until the punishment ended.

1,"AITA for not liking kids, not wanting kids, and not getting involved when my niece/nephew are around? | I have two brothers and I am the youngest (M23). Both of them are married and I'm single (never had a girlfriend). Oldest brother (33) has two kids and is planning for a third, and second oldest brother (29) plans to have kids at some point.

I've never really liked children; it's not something I particularly want to deal with because of the noise they create, their needs, the stress, the parenting and the teaching. It's all a lot to deal with and I'd rather avoid it, so even if I do find someone special I don't plan to have kids.

Then came along my niece and nephew. Whenever the two of them are around at a family reunion or when my brother has them over at the house for us (parents and I) to babysit, I mostly stay in my room away from them.

1,"AITA for accepting a 1 year medical school deferment so I can see if I can make a legit shot at an MMA career? Wife and parents might all divorce/disown me. | I can't give too much away about my situation because it would reveal where I am. But I started medical school this past week. Due to some clerics errors compounded by a faculty emergency they asked for volunteers to take a one year deferment. I accepted it (without asking my wife). 

For some background I've always wanted to be a doctor. Both my parents are doctors, my wife is a nurse and I really enjoy the medical field. But I love, love, love, MMA. It's my passion, in fact I'd hoped to backdoor my way into an MMA career through medicine. I wrestled in high school, am a purple belt in JiuJitsu, train Muy Thai and am 2-0 in amateur MMA.  My MMA coach thinks I have a legit shot at turning pro of I can lose 30lbs and go into the flyweight division.

The deferment offer seemed like a message from heaven. This is my chance to really focus on MMA, maybe pick up my pro card and see where it goes. For sure before I pick up all the school debt and am forced to be in medicine for the next 30 years. I will never get this shot again. We are more than comfortable living on my wife's salary and I may even be able to pick up some sponsors on Instagram.

Well wife is furious at me for not running  this by her and she thinks I'm basically putting our future in jeopardy if I get injured. My parents revealed to me that thier plan all along was to pay for three years of school so we aren't in debt and they are furious with me. My wife and parents are like this joint immovable wall and everyone is mad.

But what's done is done and I can't take back the deferment. My dad found me a post bachelor research position that might even get some some experience to make m1 easier. My wife is demanding I take it. I want to train full time.

1,"AITA for getting upset with my family for eating food I buy for myself? | So I graduated college last spring, and I have been living with my family until I earn enough money to move out. Because they stock so much food in both the fridge and the pantry for all of them, I try not to bring in too much food specifically for myself. The only two things I do buy for myself regularly are Quaker Oats oatmeal and Lactaid milk (not lactose intolerant, but I was raised on it and I like the taste of it). I’m someone that constantly rushes out the door every morning if I have somewhere to be, so I need a breakfast that’s both pretty healthy, and can be made and eaten within about 5 minutes.

Over the last few weeks, I've been noticing that my oatmeal packets keep disappearing at a rate faster than I am eating them. For example, if I start with a box of 8 packets, and only have 2 or 3 during the week (sometimes I skip eating breakfast at home to get something while I'm out), by the end of the week I end up having only 2 or 3 packets left. Those numbers don't add up. At first, I thought that maybe I just wasn't paying attention to how many I was eating and just going through them quickly, but at a party recently, my little brother asked me if I was eating HIS packets of Quaker Oats oatmeal (He said it with a friend with him and kind of almost smirking, like he was trying rile me up and make me mad over it, but it just highlighted to me that there is a chance that he is eating them), and that made me think that he, and possibly other people in my family, were taking the foods I bring into the house for myself.

I know this sounds ridiculous, but I buy that specific brand of oatmeal with my own money for myself, and there are already at least 3-4 boxes of the Trader Joe's oatmeal that the rest of my family eats in the pantry at all times, so it makes me just a little upset when someone goes into the foods I buy specifically for me, which makes me spend more of my own money to replace it. If I try to voice my displeasure with this, I am accused of being selfish, and told that ""anything that goes in the FAMILY pantry/fridge is available to ANYONE."" (I know the obvious solution would be to stockpile non-perishables in a place where they wouldn't find it, but I already tried that with my bedroom, was quickly found out, and now I'm constantly teased about where my ""secret stash"" is in my room)

So TL;DR, AITA for being upset with my family for eating some of the few things I buy with my own money, thus making me spend more to replace them?

0,"AITA for getting mad at the girl who blocked my parking spot | First, background info.

My parking spot is challenging on its own. My parking lot is in the back of my building and each spot is long enough for two cars. The first few spots of the lot are on a decline towards the building (meaning the part of the car closer to the alley is higher than the part of the car closest to the building). To make things worse my spot is the very first one and is next to the sidewalk, which is level to the alleyway. My spot has a giant manhole at the end right by the alley and sidewalk. This manhole is so messed up if you aren’t careful going over it you bottom out. Finally, and important to note, there is an entire parking lot on the other side of the alley that is empty and does not tow.

Next door to my building is another apartment building; however, this one does not have any parking spots allocated to it. In the past couple weeks there has been this same car that parks off the side of the alleyway blocking my spot. Earlier this week as I was leaving for work and she was blocking my spot. She didn’t move until I shot her a look.

So today, I was on my way back from work. Full disclosure, I was in a bad mood because school, work and life exist. And, I had accidentally slammed my entire hand in the car door while leaving work about 15 minutes prior. I get to the lot and SHE WAS BLOCKING MY SPOT AGAIN. I had to come in from the other side and finesse my way into the spot like I’ve never had to before. Took me an extra 5 minutes, and I only had one good hand at the moment.

So, then I see her come out of the building next to mine (as the door is literally RIGHT NEXT to my car). So, I get out of the car and I just look at her and I say, ""Not to be a dick, but do you think you could stop parking your car there. We both know this isn't the first time you've been in my way and that's NOT a parking spot. There is quite literally an entire EMPTY lot right beside where you are parked and you chose to BLOCK me so that you were, what? 5 feet closer to the door? Do you think you could maybe not? I'd hate to be forced to have your car towed"". (And yes, that is almost exactly what I said and I have an attitude when I'm in a good mood so I'm sure it came out assertive and sassy) She looked shocked/scared and let out a meek, ""okay"". I rolled my eyes and just walked away.

Now I'm not a stranger to lecturing people who deserve it, but this is the first time I've ever just snapped on a stranger. I'm afraid of turning into a bitter old ""can I speak to the manager"" lady. Not that it's really that extreme. Point being, was my anger directed at her warranted or am I being extra grumpy today?",False,False

1,"AITA for using the butter in the fridge | So I have this roommate who got mad at me a couple weeks ago bc I used his chicken stock.

But I realised that was a bit of a marginal thing and it was reasonable for him to not want others to use his Chicken stock, so I stopped using it. But not several weeks latter he accuses me of stealing food again and I ask what and he says butter. I had taken some butter from the fridge and used it. I think this is ridiculous. Are we to have 6 sticks of butter for all 6 people in the house? 6 boxes of salt? Some kitchen things it makes no sense to not have communally. I buy ingredient of that kind for whole of kitchen to use. The big drum of olive oil is my olive oil, the salt is my salt, etc. To me it makes no sense someone to be mad over the use of ingredients like this.

Furthermore, I’m only ever told about these issues when something is mentioned about my lack of trust in her or my own issues , so I feel like she’s using this to manipulate me.

1,"AITA for telling my daughter to eat more? | My daughter is 20 and interns at an office as part of her degree; typical 9-5 thing. It’s good work experience for her and I am happy she’s doing it, but she always comes home from work absolutely starving. The problem with this is she eats not long after she gets home, cooking or reheating her own dinner because she doesn’t eat meat and we do, and she doesn’t always eat with us (myself, her father and brother). Normally before her job, she would reheat or make her dinner to eat with us. She usually eats around 6:30 whereas we eat closer to 7 and she says she can’t always wait until 7 to eat because she’s so starving after work and she has to wake up early during the week too. 

Now I certainly get that. I’m retired now but I remember being starving after work and wanting to eat dinner sooner rather than later but I think it’s nicer to eat as a family. 

I told her she clearly needs to be eating more at work then so she’s not so starving when she gets home. She says there’s not always time to have a full meal and she usually just eats a few snacks during the day, and that besides, she likes sometimes just watching Netflix while eating dinner rather than feeling like she had to talk after a full day of work.

1,"AITA for expecting my brother's business to pay me while watching our sick mother? | My brother is a multi millionaire, he owns his own business he is known for being a tightwad. I am a retired government employee, He offered me a part time job as a tech consultant for his company, salary based on 3 days per week was the agreement so the pay is the same if I work 4 hours or 9 hours. I do not get any benefits, however he has paid me on some holidays if he was feeling generous. The only true critical part of my job is that I make the bank deposit at the end of the day, typically one day a week or up to three days a week if he is not there, if neither of us are there he has to pay his secretary OT to do the deposit. (she comes in at 5am, we close when the last truck arrives could be 3 could be 7 just depends.)

Recently our 85 year mother got sick, I took her to the hospital. Visiting hours are 9am to 9pm, for the week she was in the hospital I was there at 9am to 9pm, most days he would relieve me for 3-4 hours in the afternoon. I knew that since he was not at work someone else would have to do the deposit, I offered to take care of the deposit on several occasions, he said no, the secretary offered to stay and do it.

I took mom home from the hospital,(she was too weak to get out of bed without help) The hospital suggested someone take FMLA to stay with her.  I stayed with her the first 24 hours, the next few days he relieved me, but only for 4 hours or so I still spent the night. The 4th day he was going to watch her all day, but then said he needed to meet his architect to talk about a deck being built at his vacation home and that he could not be there until noon, that is today we will see what happens.

On payday I found that I had no paycheck, nothing. AITA for thinking that by brother could have paid me something even though I have no benefits even a partial paycheck, knowing that I offered to come to work and he told me no? I feel like he should have appreciated that stayed with mom 75% of the time compared to his 25%, which allowed him to stay at work and do what he needed to do, he did benefit from me being with mom it allowed him to do his work, and in the end he or his company actually saved the cost of my paycheck, so not only did I not get paid he profited for it. If I had a government job I would have had sick time, or FMLA to still get paid during this period. I am not expecting to be paid for watching my mom, that is my responsibility as son, But I would have appreciated getting paid for the fact that had I not spent those long hours with mom, he would have had to step away from his work to do his share, and I offered to come to work, had he said sure he will watch mom, so I could go to work I would have had a paycheck.

Please do not make this about my mother, that is not the issue here, I would have stayed with her no matter what and done whatever it takes to see her get better, this is about me dedicating more time to her than my brother so that his personal/business life was not impacted as much as mine.",False,False

0,"AITA for taking a platonic friend to a wedding? | This happened years ago and I never really thought that I did anything wrong, but another wedding question in this subreddit made me start wondering otherwise. 

Everyone here was mid-20s and without much money (most of us were grad students). I'm a guy who had a male housemate for two years and in the second year his fiancee moved in as well after she finished undergrad in another town. Just after he finished grad school, they were getting married and I was invited to the wedding along with a ""plus one"". The bride's parents (who I had never met - they deliberately never visited our place while their daughter was ""living in sin"") were paying for the wedding and the reception.

At the time, I happened to be single, so I thought I would take a female friend as a ""date"" to the wedding who was also a friend of the groom's and many of his other friends (they were all in the same graduate program).  Because she didn't know the bride at all, she hadn't made the cut for the guest list. There was no illusion that this was a romantic date - the friend, the groom, and the bride all knew that I was 100% gay - though I imagine that any casual observer who didn't know me (like the bride's parents) might have assumed that we were a couple. 

At the time, I thought it was perfectly fine. I had a friend with me, which is nicer than being alone, and she got to hang out with a bunch of people besides me that she knew at the reception. In retrospect, I've started to wonder whether this was taking advantage of the bride's parents - they were paying for each guest after all, and the spirit of the wedding tradition is that new and old couples are celebrating the formalization of another couple's commitment to each other. We weren't really a couple at all in that sense. And at the very worse, I was treating that ""plus one"" as something I was entitled to use however I wanted.

1,"AITA for telling my mother to rebook flights to the correct city | I live on an island with 2 cities, each has an airport. One city is in the south, the other is in the north. I live 30 mins from the north city and it's a 2.5 to 3 hr drive to the south city. 

My mum lives in the same country in a city 6hr away (by flight). She will be in my region next year to see a friend and suggested she pop over to my island for a weekend while she's there. Great idea. We chat about timing on the phone and i mention a sale a specific airline is running. 
I follow up the phone conversation with an SMS confirming her dates are fine and mentioning the sale and flying to North city.

A week later she messages back to tell me her flight arrival times for South city. I call her immediately to confirm she is flying to south city instead of north. She is. When i ask why on earth she's done that she tells me I mentioned flying to South city during our phone call and i must have said the wrong thing and misled her. I don't think i did this (i know what city i live in) but don't recall the details of the phone conversation. I know i texted her the correct city and we can both see that SMS in our phones. She admitted it seemed strange to fly to south city when i live in the north but she thought it was what i wanted and said ""it's booked now and too late to be changed"". 

Her expectation was that I drive (2.5-3hrs each way) to pick her up and drop her back to the airport at south city. I have a fulltime job and will be 8 months pregnant when she visits. I think this expectation is unreasonable.

I spoke to the airline and because they are discount tickets it will cost hundreds to change the destination city. I emailed her and told her I will not be picking her up (there's limited transport between the two cities so a bus/train is not an option) and her best option is to rebook new sale fares to the north city (approx $150-200) and forfeit her existing flights.

She does not work and lives on a limited income. She's also incredibly frugal and avoids spending money as much as possible. I offered to give her some money toward the cost but will not pay for the whole amount. I originally offered to pay the change fee thinking it would be $50 or so but after speaking to the airline its much more.

Mum gave us an interest free loan to buy our first house (paid back now) and has always been supportive.

1,"AITA for refusing to buy my child diapers and other baby stuff? | My ex and I have a toddler together. We split when she was 4 months old, she's 2 now and still in diapers. My ex has primary custody but I get weekends.

Here in Canada, parents get something called ""baby bonus"" which is situation specific but generally $300-600/mo. This is from the government irrespective of income level. It's not split between parents, when you do your taxes, one party is determined as the one who gets it (as far as I can tell, it's random). I personally get $550/mo in baby bonus.

So every month when I get this direct deposit, I send it all to my ex. She has primary custody, it should be with her. I've talked to my tax person to see if they could make it formally go to her and no dice.

I find out my ex is not using all of the funds on our child. She gets diapers and food and all that but only the bare minimum. When it's my turn to have our child over, she doesn't supply diapers or food or anything. To me, it seems right to me that with the baby bonus, she should be supplying all this stuff. Right now I'm paying out of pocket for the things baby bonus is intrinsically meant for. As far as I can tell, she is pocketing the rest.

So I told her I would no longer be buying diapers or wipes or etc unless we can agree that I take $100 of the monthly baby bonus so I can keep stock on hand. My ex refuses so we're at a standstill. Last month I tried to send only $450 over and it was only an hour before I began hearing from her lawyer, so I relented. I think my only option is to play hardball and just refuse to buy this stuff, or *at least let her think that*, I wouldn't deprive my child of whatever they needed.

Am I being the asshole here?

Now we come to the trash. Sarah wants us to take initiatives with taking out the trash, so whoever sees that it's full can take it out. (She also wanted us to do the same thing when it comes to cleaning in the kitchen, but since me and the other guy are a lot less fussy about it, most cleaning ends up being done by her, and we all seem to be ok with it.) With the trash, it ends up being Sarah taking it out, mostly just because me and the other guy are more busy/pay less attention to these things.

Sarah replied saying ""this is pretty accurate, like with @OP @otherguy and taking out the trash."" Even though it was a follow up to a joke, I thought it was very unnecessary for her to call me out like this, and her attitude regarding the whole thing is unreasonable. I have suggested in the past that we should have a rigid rotation of the chores/trash duty, but she turned it down saying she doesn't mind doing most of it since she has higher standards. But she thinks I should ""grow up and do the adult thing"" which is to take initiatives when it comes to the trash, whereas I think she's just setting herself up for unhappiness with the way she's organizing this, and it's not really my fault that she has to explicitly tell us to take out the trash, so she should cut out the hostility.

0,"AITA for not wanting to cook any thanksgiving meal cause my brother will just criticize everything? | love to cook, its one of my favorite things to do. My brother used to cook with me and it was a neat little bonding activity we did together. About a month ago tho he called me a shit cook and how he hates everything I make. I felt very disrespected by that and while we made up I don't want him to help me cook or any of that. Thanksgiving is coming up and I have volunteered to help my mom cook the meal. I was sorta testing out some foods (just small dishes for tests). My brother tried to come and try some of it and maybe I'm pissed but I really didn't want him calling me names or any of that while I was just testing stuff out so I basically told him to get out of the kitchen and leave me alone. My mom overheard that and told me to be nicer to him, I had to let him eat my food and yet again that little fucker said that it was trash and poured the rest down the sink. I had enough with him constantly criticizing and making fun of my hobby and passion so I called him an asshole before just storming off. My mom came to talk to me about 15 minutes later after she got done yelling at my brother for being mean and forcing him to clean the dishes. She told me that I am grounded for the rest of the week (friday-sunday) just like my brother. I tried to protest but I know whatever I said wasn't gonna work.

I am so done with my brother always critiquing my shit and honestly I don't even wanna cook on thanksgiving anymore cause he will just embarrass me in front of our extended family.

We were having a discussion a month ago about it and she asked if I would find her just as attractive. I didn’t want to lie to her.

0,"AITA for not laughing at an improv show? | For my birthday last night, I went with a group of friends to an improv show at a small community theater in Philadelphia.  I went into it with a good attitude; I usually enjoy improv.

The one-hour show began, and I started to notice that the rest of the audience (and my friends, for that matter) seemed to be laughing at the attempt at humor like they’d never heard a joke before.  I found the two actors boring and annoying and didn’t utter a single chuckle during the entire routine.  I just didn’t find it comedic.  Throughout the show, I would sometimes see the actors looking at me (I was front and center), giving me the death stare.  

Despite the dull nature of the show, I nevertheless clapped at the end.  I recognize that improv is difficult, and takes balls to get up on stage in front of fifty-or-so people.

1,"AITA for refusing to compensate or credit my friend in a film that’s loosely based on his childhood trauma? | 
Using a throwaway because it’s   possible to figure out my identity if I post on my main account. (However, I am in no way famous and have yet to achieve any form of mainstream success with my work). 

I recently made a low-budget indie film that is loosely inspired by some childhood trauma a friend of mine experienced. He’s confided in me slowly about these events throughout the years. I found his story to be tragic but also extremely interesting from a creative perspective. (I should note that my friend is not a writer and, as far as I know, he has little to no interest in the arts). 

The film is now done, with the exception of some last minute edits that need to be made. All names of people, places, etc. have been changed. The dialogue is entirely my own, and so are nearly all of the details. Still, given my source of inspiration, I asked my friend to be among the first to view the film. I kept the plot a surprise, which I admit was a precarious decision. Thankfully, he loved it and provided only positive feedback after the viewing. However, a few days later—I believe, after speaking with someone about it—his attitude changed significantly. 

My friend has now requested (1) some form of credit in the film’s opening lines and (2) a small percentage of the profits. (I have no idea what #2 would look like even if I agreed, since calculating profits can be an extremely complicated endeavor. There is also a significant chance that there will be no profits to distribute. However, I suppose we could come to some agreement about compensation, if I were so inclined). 

I happen to have several lawyers in my family. I am confident that, based on the specific circumstances at play here, I have no legal obligation to accommodate either of my friends requests. At least for now, this is a moral issue rather than a legal one. (I am sure some could make arguments about the legalities but I am **not** looking for legal advice at this time, and I would not post in this forum for that purpose, in any case). 

What I am wondering is - do I have some moral duty to oblige my friend’s requests for acknowledgement and/or money?

1,"AITA for kicking out my [M20] roommate [F21] after she made fun of a girl who overdosed? | Background: I [20M] have a roommate Fiona [F21] who moved in six months ago. We both go to the same college and share a lot of mutual friends so we've always gotten along. 

Earlier today though we found out a girl at our college overdosed. We both didn't know her well although I've spoken to her a few times and she seemed really sweet. I was in shock when we found out but I was surprised Fiona didn't look like she cared. 

I get it, she didn't know her but I would expect her to at least have some sympathy for her. I said something like ""How horrible, that poor girl"" and she randomly fired back ""She did it to herself"". I was really shocked, I have never heard Fiona act like that before. I responded ""No, she needed help"" and she half cut me off with ""I mean let's be honest, it's one less druggie in the world, not like she was gonna do anything. I don't know why your acting sad about it"" along with making fun of me for being emotional.

Her lack of compassion angered me so I raised my voice a little (but not yelling) and told her to get the hell out. She acted shocked and flipped me off as she sped-walk out the door.

It's been a few hours and I've gotten texts from mutual friends being like ""You should of have left or went to your room you didn't need to kick her out"" and ""She probably didn't mean it"".

1,"WIBTA if I kicked my daughter out when she turns 18 next month | Very long story, I can clarify as needed.

In the recent past, my daughter has had a complete shift of behavior. She used to be a ""good kid"" who handled her business and I thought we had a good relationship.  The only thing we have ever asked of her is that she go to school, get passing grades, and come home on time, which I don't think is too much to ask of a 17-year-old HS senior.

Apparently, it is though and whenever her Dad or I try to implement consequences she screams at us. She screams many entitled things, such as ""since you forced me to go to driver training, you owe me a car and you can't take it away"". Now I did encourage her to take driver training, and paid for it, and spent every single one of the 50+ hours that I needed to in the car with her teaching her how to drive. She then got her license, we gave her a car, then she crashed it into a tree due to reckless driving. After that, I explained that she would need to buy her own car, but she could use an extra one to drive to school and work only. Well fast forward and she has no money, no car, and drives mine where ever the hell she pleases. Both her Dad and I work full-time and don't have the time to babysit her car usage, but clearly there is no way I can trust her.

So we sold the extra car. The attitude and entitlement are too much some times.

Her Dad found her a car that she could buy for $100 and it needed $100 in repairs and around $120 to get a plate and registration, plus ongoing insurance costs. She has paid $0 so far even though we said she can do payments. She promised $100 out of her last paycheck. When I asked for it, she yelled at me that she had to get gas so she didn't have the money. Today is payday, if I don't get some sort of payment then I am selling the car.

And all these car issues are just the tip of the iceberg, but I think they are representative of the problems that we have, Change car to cell phone, curfew, going to class and it is the sameish argument every time. We say those are your obligations, she said I don't have to and you can't make me, and we end up arguing.

Clearly, she has been spoiled. I had a shitty childhood and ended up in foster care and homeless, etc., so I just wanted her to have nice things and a nice life and a good chance at making a good future for herself.

Now she says that she is scared of her Dad and me and that is why she doesn't come home or follow the rules. I am not perfect and I do lose my temper and yell sometimes, but I have always been very clear that I love her and want the best for her and I have never gotten physical. In my mind, there is no reason for her to be scared of me or her Dad, but you never know what teens are thinking. So long story short, I am sick of it and all the strife and I just want her to leave and live on her own so she can figure out what life is really about.

0,"AITA for sitting in the priority seating area on a bus? | There’s a bus that seats 20 people in my neighbour hood. In case you’ve never been on this type of bus, there’s five rows, and in each row there are four seats in total with two seats on either side of the aisle. Row 1 is priority seating.

As I get on the bus I notice there’s only 5 other passengers and no one in the priority seating area.  I only ride the bus for 3 stops and so I thought I’d sit in 1 of the 4 priority seating spots for now and get up as the bus starts filling. I take up sit the window seat, with a free aisle seat next to me.

At the next stop, an elderly gentleman saunters on and decides to sit next to me in the aisle seat. As he sits down, a woman behind me taps my shoulder and says, “can you read?” She points at the sign that says ‘priority seating for the disabled and the elderly’. I don’t say anything at first because I’m surprised she cares. It’s not as if I’m taking the only spot where he can sit. In fact, the aisle seat is more convenient for him since he wouldn’t need to scooch over to the window. Plus there were two other seats on the other side of the aisle. Clearly he didn’t care if he chose to sit next to me rather than in the other two free priority spots. 

The elderly gentleman actually speaks first and says, ‘I enjoy the company.’ Then she starts talking about how I should never sit in priority seating regardless of how empty the bus is and that young people are entitled.  I get visibly uncomfortable and another passenger starts to defend me and says, ‘she’s allowed to sit there.’

Anyways, I get off at my stop and thank the people who defended me.

1,"AITA for not wanting to eat at fast food or takeout places and being happy with bringing my own meals instead? | I grew up not eating fast food to the point where I can list off the number of times I've eaten at a McDonald's using one hand. It just wasn't a part of my family's culture and reality. Headed into adulthood, I've just never needed to. I'm never too tired to make some eggs and toast or heat up leftovers or a frozen leftover/prep meal. 

This really upsets my boyfriend. I wouldn't say that he eats a lot of fast food, but there have been times when we've gone on road trips or something and I've prepared by making us meals and snacks for a cooler, or found grocery shops along the way, etc. If he ever said ""I just want a Mcuffkin"" or whatever they're called I would say go for it and pull out a yogurt. 

But it bothers him that I won't ""just loosen up"" and eat McDonald's and because it makes him feel self-conscious he ends up having to eat my healthy (or even just home cooked) meals instead. I don't want to ""loosen up"" because I have perfectly good food that I have prepared ready 99% of the time. The 1% I'm not, I am happy to find a grocery store and get something. 

It has become an issue because we are moving in together, and he is not all about the division of labor including him being expected to also cook X amount of meals, or clean up in response to me making those meals instead. He's been calling me uptight and controlling, talking about how I must have an eating disorder because I'm so preoccupied with not including takeout or fast food in our meal plans. I find that to be a ridiculous oversimplification of eating disorders for one. But look, any time he's been over at my place and he's said ""I'm soooo hungry let's just go pick up drive-through"" and I've made us some eggs and toast or rice or whatever, he's been FINE.

So as I am into chess quite a bit, I was naturally drawn to it and was challenged by a man and his child to a 2vs2. My partner was another kid that I didn't know and we played best of 3.

We won the first round, my partner and I but lost the second round. Came the third round, we won convincingly, shook hands and parted. I, being pretty happy of the games decided to tell my brother and parents about it and they all called me out on it. They said that if they were me, they would 'give face', which means to let other people win because the man was with his child. Basically, the would let the man and his child win for the sake of the man's potential embarrassment towards the son and said I was too competitive and immature. 

In my own defense, a game or sport of any kind is totally unenjoyable when one side purposely allows the other party to win. I perceive it as looking down on the other party when someone allows them to win for the sake of embarrassment. Besides, it sucks the fun out of the game when one side doesn't try to actually play the game.

1,"AITA for Going Full-Karen on a Restaurant Worker? | FYI I'm a guy, but I don't know what the male-equivalent of a Karen is.

I'm eating at a fast food restaurant with my friends. We ordered full combo meals that come with drinks, and I'm pretty sure they come with free refills, because the drink machines are located outside of the food prep areas. I've never needed a refill because I don't drink too much soda, as I wanna watch my caloric intake.

Anyways, after a very greasy meal with a sugary drink, I decided I should probably stop before I become a Type 2 diabetic. Instead of refilling my empty soda drink, I walk outside to my car, grab my water bottle, and walk back inside to wash it all down with some fresh water.

Lo and behold, an employee walks over to me and tells me I can't bring that in here. I ask for clarification, and he tells me I can't bring my water bottle in here. I ask him why not and he says restaurant policy. I don't see a sign or anything, so I ask him:

""What's the difference if I walk outside, drink from my water bottle, and walk right back in?""

He just repeats again that no outside food or drink is allowed in here. Well I flatly decline and go back to eating.

The employee gets VERY CLOSE to me, standing inches to my side, leans in, puts his hands on the table, and says ""No outside food or drinks allowed""

My friends all get up in arms going all ""Wooooooaaaaaaah"" and ""Hey!!!!"" and the employee backs off.

I try to get cute and I take the top cover off my drink and pour my water into it. I put the cover back on, push the drink further away from the employee so he doesn't just grab it and throw it away, and I ask him to move aside, which he does.

I take my semi-empty water bottle with me as I make my way towards the front and I demand to speak with their manager.

I explained I don't like being intimidated, especially since I'm just bringing in a bottle of water after putting down like $60 worth of food for my friends and I (I know the amount I spend doesn't mean I'm the boss, however repeat business is nice to have with people who spend. Certainly not worth losing that over a BOTTLE OF WATER). The manager apologizes to me, offers me a desert of my choice, which I politely decline (I was stuffed at that point), and she takes the employee out of the serving area and somewhere into the back.

We ended up getting a 15% discount by way of apology, and the manager personally comes out to assure me this won't happen again.

I took it a bit too far by saying I felt physically threatened by that employee and that perhaps the restaurant shouldn't hire someone who's physically confrontational with their customers (aka I was angling to get his ass fired because I hated that power-tripping dude).

Point is, when I hangout with all my friends in their early 20s, I don’t exactly want to hangout with a dude in his late 40s. He’s not a bad guy, but he gets drunk like he’s one of the boys and engages in “locker room talk” about women who are like our age. I think it’s really disturbing. 

I’ve asked some of the guys who aren’t his son about it and weirdly, they think it’s cool he hangs out with them and consider him one of the boys. Apparently he had his kids really young and was married already in his early 20s and didn’t have the opportunity to get drunk and party with his friends. So now he does it with his son and his friends. 

Next time this group hits me up, I really want to ask if his dad will be there. I love my friends and still want to hangout with them, but The dad being around ALL THE TIME is too much. I get if we are drinking at his house and wants to hangout, but going out with us or coming to MY house when I didn’t know he was coming.

0,"AITA for Refusing to Pump my GF's Tire? | Whenever my GF's car has any sort of maintenance issue she tries to hold me accountable for finding the issue, fixing it, or taking it to get fixed. When she had an issue with one of her tires a while ago I was the first to notice how low it was and gave her a heads up as she was leaving for work. A day later it was completely flat because she didn't pump air in it (or get it inspected). So I ended up doing it for her. At that time I also decided to buy her PSI gauge and showed her how to use it. This was about the extent of my capabilities and when I started to notice a pattern of other car-related demands I made it very clear that I don't know shit about fixing cars besides the very basics (changing a tire, pumping air, pouring oil, jumps starts). She still insisted that I call her Dad and ask questions or watch youtube videos to learn how. My response was that I'd prefer that a mechanic take care of it and that she could learn to do these things if she wanted.

&#x200B;

Now another tire has a slow leak and needs to be refilled about once a week or two (not entirely sure bc I've never seen it completely flat). She insists that I check the pressure every morning before work and drive it to the gas station to fill the tire as needed (until she gets it fixed/replaced). She says she never noticed the leak before and had to rely on the help of strangers to check the pressure and pump the tire for her.

&#x200B;

I asked why she needed strangers (they're always men btw) to do something that I've taught her how to do already. She claimed that she didn't know how, didn't want to get dirty, and ultimately its a man's responsibility. I told her that as a car owner (man or woman) you should know how do something as basic as pump a tire and change a flat (especially since I showed her how). I told her that it seemed like she was playing the ""Damsel in distress"" role and acting completely helpless on purpose. I also reminded her that she could be stranded one day and may need to know how to do these things instead of relying on the generosity of complete strangers. She replied saying that all of her male friends/family agreed with her and that they were ""real men"" b/c they knew how to take care of a woman.

&#x200B;

I don't really care for the silly, outdated gender role bs and I've made it very clear. On top of that I do plenty of handy work around the house, cook and clean regularly ( I cook more often than she does in fact), and I pay majority of our expenses (including all of the rent). The way I see it, this shouldn't make me any less of a man in her eyes. I also never hold her to lofty standards, or stereotypical expectations just bc she's a woman, but she always seems comfortable doing it to me.

&#x200B;

To settle the issue, I offered again to show her how to use the pump while we were at the gas station this past weekend. She flatly refused..... So now I'm determined not to lift a finger. AITA here?",False,False

It was my dad's prized possession and it is now mine and because it was my dads prized posseion, I made sure to take care of the car   and part of taking care of it and making sure it stays as intact as possible is not letting anyone else drive it. No one else drove the car but me. I never sat in the passenger seat since my dad gave it to me. 3 weeks ago, my wife got rear ended and her car is now totalled and she has no car. But we live in a city where there is public transport and I tell her that she can take the bus if she needs to go out. But she is been begging me to let her use my car but I keep saying no despite that i keep explaining to her that it is my dad's prized possession and I do not wish to share it. The other day she got mad at me after I woudlnt let her use my car to go see her mother who lives 30 minutes away from the city and I thought that was so childish. But when I talked to my sisters about it, they said that I should be more trusting and be willing to share my prized possession with my wife but the thing is, it's not only my prized possesions, it's also my dad's prized possession and if i let anyone drive it and they crash it, it would be like losing my dad a second time.

1,"AITA ? -- I regularly nudge, jostle and sometimes push people exiting airplanes. | I fly often.  I prefer aisle seats.  And I support a firm rule:  You stay in or by your seat when exiting a plane.  Because people exit *in the order of seating, from the front to the back.*

I remain in my seat until the people in the rows 1 or 2 in front of me begin leaving.  Then I stand and get my carryon out of the overhead bin.  And I always let the people across from me go first.

Unfortunately a common occurrence is that people further back jump up when the plane lands and push up in the aisle.  Meaning when I'm ready to get up the aisle is clogged--not by the people across from me, but people from the back.  

That does not deter me.  I'm standing up, no matter how crowded it is.  Sure, I'll give an *excuse me.*  Sometimes the crowd is light and it works easy.  

But often not.  Sometimes it's real packed by people from the back.  And the people in the aisle right by my seat (from further back) can't really back up well because of the crowd behind them.

Tough.  I'm getting up into the aisle.   I'm 6'4 so it's usually not a challenge for me.  Make a space.   And if  I see a bunch of knuckleheads from the back have tried to snake their way up, I can get pretty pushy.

0,"AITAH for going scorched earth on a friend over a text message? | Honestly, the title is misleading but that is technically what the situation boils down too. 

For some back story, my friend is a recovering heroin addict. She’s been struggling with addiction her entire adult life. I’ve always shown my unconditional love, sometimes to the point of enabling though I work really hard to tow that line. She’s lived with my husband, son and I on and off throughout the years.

I’ve always been there when she called. I’ve given money and endless amounts of time. I’ve put in so much effort. Picking her up late nights, driving 45 plus minutes when she needed me. 

When she went off to get sober, she and her bf made the decision to leave and head across the states. It was abrupt, she didn’t tell me until the night they were leaving. I gave her the money to make the trip safely. 

When she came home the first time she passed out in our driveway and was so far gone I thought she had OD. I helped her leave home again.

If anyone has ever loved an addict maybe you understand, but when they call or text and seem erratic or upset it leaves you super uneasy, especially when they are in recovery. 

That leads us up to now. She has been sober again and made the decision to come home for good. We spent one night together and had been texting every day after that. In the middle of the week she suddenly sends me an erratic string of texts about being “SO FUCKING UPSET” and “screwed completely out of money”. I texted her back on my break and on and off days after, attempted calling and all that. We had made plans for the weekend and the weekend goes by and I still haven’t gotten a response. I reached out to her sister finally, because I was worried, and was told she is fine. 

I look on Facebook and she’s been posting, acting normal. I finally text her again and tell her basically “Wtf, I’m hurt? You could have let me know you’re okay?” And I don’t get a response for another few days, when I do she tells me I’m being bitchy and that her phone was broke. She had no way to text anyone, but we talk on FB messenger.... and she was on FB. I don’t bother hashing that out though. I just explain that I’m hurt because she could have just told me she was fine but busy, I wouldn’t have cared and I just wanted to know she was safe and okay. Instead of replying to my message she starts posting stuff about “People change up on you when you start doing stuff for yourself for once.” And the like, which really hurts because most of our relationship has been seriously one sided.

I decide my last message said enough and I block her on everything.

One of the new girls she’s been hanging out with reached out to me and told me I was a bitch, the reason addicts have trouble getting sober, and all other kind of things because I blocked her and haven’t been returning her phone calls.

1,"AITA for not giving my roommate my Wifi password? | To give a little background info, I’m a grad student living at an apartment complex that is aimed at college students but not affiliated with my college. It’s not the nicest place, but it’s cheap, furnished, and includes all utilities. WiFi is included, but you have to have your own router. The only real issue is that the complex doesn’t do one-bedroom units, and since I didn’t have anyone to room with, I was randomly assigned a roommate. This original roommate didn’t show. 

Because I was the only person living in the apartment when I moved in, I bought the cheapest model of router at the store, assuming that I would be the only one using it. It’s a little slow, and the range isn’t great, but it works fine for me. It’s set up in my bedroom. 

Eventually, the apartment complex sent someone else to live in the other bedroom. When she moved in, the internet was actually down (service provider issue), and it took several weeks to get it back up. Once it was fixed, my new roommate asked me how to get on the internet, and I told her she would need to get a router. She asked if she could use mine, but I explained that it wasn’t a powerful model and that she should really get one for her own room. A few days later, she comes back and asks for my WiFi password because she went to someone else’s apartment and their router was in one bedroom and she could use it in the other bedroom. I told her no and shut my door. 

I admit that I could have been more patient, but one of my biggest pet peeves is when people ask me a question and completely ignore my answer. It’s the second time she’s done it in a week. Besides that, I’ve never been great at sharing. I like to buy my own stuff and be the only person that uses it. 

That being said, I bought the router, but we’re both paying for WiFi. Am I the asshole because I won’t let her use my router?",False,False
0,"WIBTA for immediately reporting my neighbors for smoking in my new apartment? | My husband and I are in the process of moving into an upscale apartment complex, and because one of my biggest pain points with our old apartment complex is that we couldn't use our balcony due to smokers, one of our biggest selling points for the new apartment was that the entire facility is non-smoking.

Today is our second day moving in, and it seems like there are more smokers in our new building than there were in our old complex.  Yesterday, we saw two separate ladies walking down the hallway smoking, and as soon as we walked out of our apartment this afternoon, I could smell smoke.  When we go downstairs, we see that the person smoking is our new downstairs neighbor who lives immediately below our apartment.  He introduced himself and he seemed really nice, so my husband thinks it is a bad idea to report the smoking to the leasing office since the new neighbors will know it is us who reported them.

Regardless, I am planning to go to the leasing office tomorrow to discuss our options.  I re-read our lease, and smoking in non-designated areas is terms for eviction.  If I had to guess, they will probably just send an email at first asking residents to stop smoking, but I plan to keep complaining if this continues.  I really don't want our neighbors to immediately hate us (and I don't wan anyone to get evicted), but I also don't want to live somewhere that smells like smoke all the time.",False,False
0,"AITA for going on a trip with the boys instead of my girlfriend? | Throwaway account. Sorry kind of long post.

My main friend group consists of 5 guys, all 20M and we've been close friends since middle school. After we graduated highschool, we planned to go on a trip to Japan to celebrate, but the plans fell through as we realized we were broke kids. We pushed the trip back a year so we could all save up some money, but one year turned into 2, then 3, because we became busy with college and work.

Started dating my gf start of this year and things have been going great. She's met my friends and gets along with them very well and was invited to come on our trip (2 of my friends gf's are coming too). She was excited since she hasn't left the States before, and I haven't either so she really liked that we were going to share a new experience together. When she was invited the plan was to go next summer, so she had around a year to save up money.

The problem: A week ago our trip began to fall apart as all of our schedules would not line up, and we thought we would have to push back another year. However we realized that we could do the trip this upcoming December/January during the holidays, where we have ~3 weeks gap where we can get vacation from work/not have classes.


But moving the trip up means that my gf can't go. She has family commitments during the holidays and does not have enough money saved up, and I can't afford to pay for both of us. She was really down about this, so I promised her that the two of us could still go on a trip to Japan or anywhere else next summer. This seemed to cheer her up a bit and I thought she was ok.

But yesterday as I was going to buy my plane ticket she told me that she didn't want me to go. Her reasoning was that she wanted us to experience leaving the country for the first time together, and she was jealous that my friends gf's were able to go and have a ""romantic"" trip together. She wants me to just go on a trip with her next year and sit this one out because I ""could always have the boys trip some other time"".

I said I still wanted to go because it has been me and my friend's dream for years. This made her unhappy and she said I was ""abandoning her just to have fun with my guy friends"" and we haven't talked since. I did feel bad, and I told my friends that I was considering going. They decided that if I wasn't going then they wouldn't go either, since we made a ""pact"" where we would all go together (a big reason why the trip kept getting pushed back in the past, since there was always someone busy).

I did some thinking and I have decided I am going to go on this trip. My friend's and I have been looking forward to this for so long and I don't want to ruin it. But when I talked/vented to my parents about this they said I was being unfair to my gf, who also looked forward to the trip, and that I should prioritize my relationship over friends.

1,"AITA for just wanting to enjoy my vacation? | AITA for just wanting to enjoy my vacation?

My boyfriend and I rented a cabin for a weekend several hours from home. When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.

I wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. 

So he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. 

He actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. 

Now, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. ",False,False
0,"WIBTA if I refused a dance based on wardrobe? | As a hobby, my GF and I regularly dance West Coast Swing (obligatory plug - it's a lot of fun and super awesome). The culture is very low-key and casual. Anybody can ask anybody to dance, and it's expected you not refuse unless there's a reason (i.e. I'm taking a break, or I'm about to leave, need to go to the bathroom, etc). In my area there is usually several opportunities a week to go out dancing, which is pretty nice.

&#x200B;

GF has a close friend who also comes out regularly - chubby, and has been losing weight due to her dancing. Due to her newfound confidence in her body image, she's been gradually wearing less when going out. At this current point, standard outfit is a bra covered with a kind of lace see-through non-shirt outer-shirt (you know, the kinds that don't actually cover anything - that people wear over tank tops, etc).

&#x200B;

She likes dancing with me, and normally pulls me for a few songs - but it's just so uncomfortable at this point. I don't mind that she wears what she wears *per se* \- I'm glad she's more comfortable in her skin. But during the dance, hands go on back, hips, and shoulders - and it sets off my ""as a boyfriend to someone else, I shouldn't be doing this"" alarms.

1,"WIBTA for refusing to have an expensive wedding | My fiancé is in love with the idea of a large, lavish wedding. 

We debated back and forth about just how large or lavish considering we’re both still in student debt and living in a crappy rented studio apartment. 

I know the wedding is really more her day than mine because she’s been focused on the ceremony of it all for a lot longer, so after back and forth we agreed she could set the budget for the wedding but we couldn’t go into debt for it (yes, she was really considering this. The wedding has really pulled the wool over her usually very fiscally responsible eyes.) 

We ended up deciding on a budget that was larger than what I was comfortable with, but with the caveat that she would allocate half and I would allocate the other half. 

After going to a bunch of cake tasting and looking at many venues, I decided to put 20% of my portion of the budget towards her dream dress about 80% of my half towards buying us a house. 

She is insisting I spend it on the wedding. 

I am resolute that this is, in the long run, what will actually make us both happiest.

But tonight my mom said “you’re being an asshole” and it made me realize I should post specifically to here.

In fact, I believe having locks on the doors could further isolate the family.

For the first round of people, she didn't ask me what I wanted, but I didn't make a big deal out of it since it was just the first round and I was in the backroom, so I assumed that she didn't see me.

But then came more rounds of drinks and she seemed to be going around and asking everyone but me. She was asking other team members all around the store what kind of drink they wanted. And I knew that she had to have known I was there, because she was using a grid, which is basically just a list of team members scheduled for the day. She even asked our security guy, who only comes in for two days a week. I was sitting in the break room when she brought in more drinks for people and she didn't even bother asking me if I wanted anything or if she had already asked me.

Me and her have a bit of an iffy history as of late.

Anyway, as I was clocking out today, she was bringing in another round of drinks and I walked by and sarcastically said to her ""Thanks for asking ME if I wanted anything."" She said ""Excuse me?"" and I just walked away.

1,"AITA for not wanting to go to an engagement party and wedding? | Ok AITA i need a judge

Relevant Information: 

I have met the best friend and her fiance a total of two times. For a couple of hours each. There has been no effort on either side to fix this as they live a few hours away. We are essentially strangers despite my gf and I dating for a year and a half.
 
The story:

My gf told me her bestie got engaged and that she was going to be Maid of Honor. I was excited for her knowing that she wanted this to happen and glad it came to be for her.  She then told me we'd been invited to the house warming and engagement party and she was okay with me not going, but i was warned I had to go to the wedding.  

I replied that I didn't want to go to the house/engagement party  as I barely know who these people are, and have little association with them let alone their actual network of friends and family. I also explained that while this could be used as an attempt to get to know them, that doing so when they have an entire house of families and friends it was super stupid  timing.  I'd get a few minutes of conversation, then be forced to walk around and attempt to mingle with strangers who i have no connection to.  

It didn't feel like an appropriate time for me to be there. (The gf would be there but mostly  acting as assistant host, catering to everyone and making sure things went smoothly as she's a very close friend, so i wouldn't be socializing around with her to introduce me around as she's busy. )

When she said that's okay  we still have the  wedding, I resisted again. I reminded her that she is the maid of honor, and I'm just her boyfriend. Not only will she be busy running errands and setting up for the wedding(which i have zero doubt I'd be roped into doing as well), but as part of the wedding party she's supposed to be with the best man for all of well...all of it. I don't have a spot in things aside from guest.

 She has to sit at the table with the wedding party and everything else during the reception, and yes we could dance after all the official first dance stuff is out of the way, but she still will be going around making sure the event goes off without a  hitch to even have time to do more than one or two dances. 

While the wedding is going on, ill be shuffled around to wherever for seating which inconveniences the bride and grooms plans, and yet again stuck with dozens of people i don't know. Same at the reception.

I feel like since i don't know the people it shouldn't be expected of me to come to these things even if i am dating the maid of honor.  

My SO is upset because I have no interest in going to either of these events. Her reasoning was that we'd have fun as a couple, I'd get to know the hosts better and she wanted an excuse to see me all dressed up and dance with me. 

So AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for refusing to use a vacation day for my sister’s wedding? | Sister just announced her wedding date, it’s on a Friday in October. I live several states away from the rest of my family so it would be impossible for me to travel to the wedding without taking a day off work.

My job has really crappy benefits and I only have five paid vacation days (yeah, I know) for the rest of the year, plus standard federal holidays. I was out of work for a long time before I got this job, so I didn’t feel comfortable trying to negotiate better benefits because I was so desperate for employment.

I’ve already planned out exactly how I want to use my vacation days for the rest of the year. I’m going going to take off five Mondays every other month starting in March to give myself some three-day weekends to recharge, as this job is pretty mentally grueling and I seriously need that time to decompress.

I asked my sister why she didn’t have the wedding on a Saturday and she said she and her fiance couldn’t afford it. I told her I wouldn’t be able to make it because my vacation time was so limited and she blew up at me. I get that it costs more to have it on a weekend, but I feel like she needs to accept that not as many people will be able to make it if she gets married on a weekday. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA for going solo to a child-free wedding? | My husband and I were invited to a friend's wedding. We are not very close to the friend,haven't socialized with them in years, although I did some work for him a while back (for free). We keep in touch here and there, FB, birthday text, etc.

Friend owns a restaurant with his GF. Wedding is at their restaurant - casual, no gifts. They've also said no kids, explanation being they can only have so many people in the restaurant (for fire code/liquor licence reasons), and if everyone brought their kids, that would mean less adults that can come.

We have a 5 year old. He has some health issues that require monitoring, although they are much less serious now than when he was a toddler. Aside from that, I am not comfortable leaving my son with just anyone.

The wedding is on the Sunday of Labour Day weekend, last long weekend of the summer. Our regular babysitter isn't available, and neither is our back-up. We're having a hard time finding a sitter, and I'm not comfortable leaving my son with someone that he doesn't know, and that we don't know and trust.

Husband and I decide he'll stay home with our son, and I'll go to the wedding. I text friend today to tell him. He asks where husband is, is everything ok, why isn't he coming - so I explain we can't get a sitter. He responds that he is a business owner, he does a lot of weddings, and he sees how kids behave, and that he just wants us to have fun. I'm a bit stunned so I ask him, where did that come from? I can have a good time without my husband (there will be other mutual friends at the wedding), but if my coming alone is a problem (for numbers, seating, whatever) to let me know. Friend responds that he is very hurt, that this is a wedding not a gathering, that I am not obligated to come, and that this isn't the first time I haven't showed up to something (we missed a party at the restaurant last winter because son was sick - I called and explained, didn't just pull a no-show). I text back and tell friend I am coming because I want to be there, repeat I'm not leaving my kid with just anyone, and that I respect his choice to have the wedding he wants, that I'm entitled to care for my child the way I choose, and ask if we could just respect each other's choices and agree to disagree.

Friend doesn't respond.

So, when we first got the invite, I wasn't offended by the no-kids stipulation - his wedding, his rules. But now, I am kind of offended that he's lumped my kid (who he hasn't seen since he was 1) in with other ""badly-behaved"" kids, and think the no-kids rule was about just not wanting kids there, as opposed to the capacity/fire code excuse. I've given them plenty of notice, wedding is exactly a month away, and I thought suggesting I go alone was a reasonable compromise in the circumstances. But now, I don't feel like going at all (solo, or with husband if we do arrange child care), and I feel like friend is acting like a Groomzilla.

0,"AITA for making my niece change her clothes before she comes to work for me? | Me and a few others run a small community project. Every thursday 
after work in the local community centre, we prepare and serve food for the homeless of the area. 

My brother and his wife asked me to take on their 17 year old daughter (who I will call Rachel) to help out, as a ''tough love'' punishment after she got into trouble at school for bullying, smoking weed and various other things. 

Rachel is a bright girl, very smart and has always performed well grades-wise. She always seemed really nice so it was sad to hear what she had been doing. She's a very fashionable girl, loves designer clothes and things like that and is obsessed with brand names. 

It was Rachel's first session today, and she turned up dressed head to toe in her expensive gear. I didn't approve. Not necessarily because the clothes would get dirty since we'd be wearing aprons anyway, but more because she will be among people who have literally nothing and are completely desperate. I didn't feel comfortable with her wearing items of clothing that cost hundreds if not thousands in front of their faces.

I made Rachel change her clothes. Her and I are roughly the same build though I'm a bit taller. I got some plain clothes of mine (jogging bottoms and t shirt) for her, she got changed and we got going. 

Throughout the whole thing Rachel was upset about how ''tacky'' she looked, saying she hated these clothes and things like that. 

After the session was over and we went back to my place, Rachel's mum came to pick her up, and Rachel started crying, saying I ''humiliated her'' by making her wear ''horrible clothes''. I explained my decision but her mum said I was ''completely unfair'' and said that I was bullying her daughter for liking nice clothes. 

I don't understand this at all. I think it would be deeply inappropriate to walk around in expensive designer clothes among people who are never even sure when their next meal is. It wasn't meant to be offensive or cruel or anything. It was just doing the right thing for everyone.",False,False

Ok so (16M) I don’t even play that much. Before  alI of this I played like an hour a day but now that I have nothing else to do I play 3-4h. I do all of my school stuff but that only takes like 3 hours.

Today when I had played for around 3 hours my (36F) mom came into my room completely randomly and cried about me playing too much and that I have to stop. She then told me that I could go for a walk with a friend but I told her that I obviously can’t do that under current circumstances.

She then started screaming like a monkey and said: ” You have to do something else than just playing games all day!” I had enough of her and straight up told her: ” I play 3-4h a day which is reasonable during this time so stop being a bitch and fuck off!”

She left after that and actually cried and I continued playing for an hour or so before going to sleep.",False,False
0,"AITA for recording my ex girlfriends son calling me a fat bastard after I told him to stop being mouthy and sending it to his mum? | My ex girlfriend and I broke up last month pretty amicably. She wanted to move on, I want to move on, we shed a couple tears but like I say it was amicable, 2020 is here and it’s a great new start. 

I’m in my 30’s and am starting to get serious about the gym etc, my ex girlfriends son is 16 and also goes to the gym, sadly the same gym as me as there isn’t another chain one for miles around. 

When I entered the swimming pool area where the lockers are I could hear him mouthing off about how I’m a fat cunt blah blah. I laughed about it and said ‘ey lad you’ve grown a pair haven’t you?’ 

That set him off and the screaming really began, constant tirade of calling me a fat bastard, etc. I lifted my phone up which was in my hand and told him I’d send this to his mum as she’d be absolutely mortified if she knew what he was doing. 

Sure enough he carried on so I sent her the vid over WhatsApp. I carried on with my day and I get a call from her later saying she’s grounded him and he’s no longer allowed out apart from school. 

Because I live in a fairly small town somehow the video got onto Facebook and lots and lots of people are commenting and weighing in. Since everyone knows it’s me, people are tagging me left right and centre saying I was out of order and I’m a shitestirrer. In my opinion I didn’t do anything wrong, he was screaming in a public place and I deserved to have proof of his behaviour",False,False
1,"WIBTA for getting upset with my wife for canceling our vacation because we just had a baby? | I'll be as brief as possible.

My family has been planning a big family Hawaiian vacation (my parents, my brother's family with 3 kids, some very close family friends) for about 10 years now to celebrate my niece's graduation from High School. It is scheduled for early/Mid August this year, and everyone is chipping in for an awesome house to rent for the week.

My wife has known about this trip since we started dating a few years ago. We have been lucky and are now pregnant, due in late June. 

My wife is telling me that she does not think we should go. The baby will only be a month or two old, and she is worried about how she will feel after giving birth. The flight would be from the Northeast US, probably a changeover in California, and then out to Hawaii.

My feeling is that people travel with 1-2 month old kids all the time. Also we will have a TON of family around us if we go on the trip who WANT to help watch the kid (so maybe we can relax more than if we stayed home), and I don't feel like she is going to still be hurting a month or two after giving birth. Mostly a guess, but my internet researching backs up the theory, so it's not completely out of the realm of possibility.

**I am supporting her feelings and haven't said anything negative yet (just how I am pretty bummed about missing it)**, but it is really making me frustrated the more I dwell on it. I've been excited about this trip for years.

So we decided to all hang out together.  Anyways, I ordered a plate of chicken wings, and offered everyone at the table some.  One of the girls responds, ""oh I don't eat meat, I'm vegan.""  Once she mentions this, she starts trying to steer the whole conversation to be all about veganism, and why it's wrong to kill animals for meat.  Anyways, after this goes on for about two or so minutes, I let her know that I'd like to talk about something else, and I'm not comfortable talking about this kind of stuff.  Then she replies, ""if you aren't comfortable talking about this, then doesn't that show that you think there is something wrong with what you're doing?""  After she said this and a couple other condescending comments, we start arguing, and eventually I told her to \*\*\*\* off and mind her own business.  She then gets upsets, and leaves.

0,"WIBTA for not inviting a severely special needs person to my party? | First time poster, Throwaway account, etc. 

I (F27) am part of a group that see each other once a week at a class. The group of 8 all get along super well for the most part and have expressed that we want to hang out and what not outside of the class. In this group is a special needs individual (Brenda F21) who I have gotten the impression that we all tolerate due to rudeness, inappropriate conversations, which is due to her special needs, so we just tend to ignore the 'bad' stuff. Brenda has also implied her special needs are severe enough that she has a 24/7 nurse for safety reasons. 

I took the initiative to plan a party and when I message the group to gauge interest, Brenda immediately starts informing me of allergies, that she will not permit alcohol at the party and a few other things. I got the sense that the group is keen to catch up; except with Brenda there. 

I messaged Brenda privately about these concerns and she then informs me that going to  a party isn't covered under her nurse's contract or insurance and that I as the host, would have to maintain that role and monitor her throughout the party for anaphylaxis reactions, absence seizures, actual seizures and be prepared at any minute to call emergency services. I am technically qualified to do this as I am the nominated first aid officer at my office; BUT it's not something I wish to be responsible for during my own time - especially because from what I understand, this isn't a 'rare' occurrence, it's a ""this happens very regularly"" occurrence. 

I don't want to openly be an asshole and set up a group chat without Brenda to plan this party - I feel that would be way too rude. I'm wondering Reddit, WIBTA for explaining to Brenda that I do not feel comfortable taking responsibility for these issues and explaining that I cannot invite her to this party in this case - as she DOES need someone watching her? The other option is, I intentionally plan the party for when Brenda is away in a couple of  weeks - but that also feels like an asshole move.",False,False

Well, two months after that (I’ve had this pet for four months now) and I get a message out the blue from my friend saying he is coming to pick up his pet this weekend.

The entire time I have looked after this pet, it has put on a few (healthy) pounds, I have purchased all of the food it needs and other necessities and also I have not heard a word from this guy in months now.

1,"AITA for being mad at my parents about them wanting to go through my phone because of weed? | For the past month I've (15M) been smoking some weed with a couple of friends. It's all been going fine until yesterday, where I had a pretty bad trip. Mild headache, some dizzyness and a fast heartrate (120bpm). I had been out til around 9pm where I came home. At this point I was really stoned. I go downstairs to my room to do homework and end up just going to bed. 

An hour later my mom comes into my room, and sees I've gone to bed early, something I usually don't do. She looks in my eyes to see that my pupils are huge, notices my fast heartrate and so on. Then I tell her that I smoked weed and that I feel ok. She doesn't believe me and stays with me on the bedside to make sure I fall asleep and that I really am okay. I do fall asleep, but around 20 minutes later I wake up to her trying to unlock my phone with my finger. I don't think about it and go to sleep again. 

The next morning I wake up to her and my dad taking my phone and asking me what the password is. I tell them that even though I did some stupid stuff that I'm not supposed to, they don't have the right to go through my phone and look at all the private messages, photos etc. I have on my phone. 

They disagree and are now saying that if I want my phone back they have to look at everything I've got on there first. 

I love them both and I know they really care about me too, but to me it just seems like a violation to my privacy for them to look through my phone.

0,"AITA for getting a single mother fired even though she was nice to me? | For context, I am really into body building and have been going to the gym 3-4 times a week since I was 13 (now 29).

There is a personal trainer, Ashley, at my current gym thats also a single mother of two. I mention this as it’s the reason I think I’m probably an asshole since she clearly needs the job to support her kids.

Anyway, I’m not really friends with her, but she’s always really nice to me and has flirted with me a lot previously. We talk occasionally. Yesterday she asked if I wanted to add her on social media and I figured why not, so I said yes.

Later in my workout I started looking through her posts out of boredom when I saw a picture of a morbidly obese person along with a caption making fun of them trying to run. The picture was clearly taken at the gym.

This really angered me because they’re trying to improve their health, and the last thing they need is some attractive young girl talking shit about them, even if it’s not to their face. I scrolled through a few more posts and sure enough this is a regular thing. She discreetly takes pictures of fat people to make fun of when they’re working out.

Really really pissed me off to see these people being made fun of for trying to fix their life. Without thinking I just went straight to the owners office (we know each other well) to show him. Ashley was fried immediately.

For some background, I've always been somewhat obsessive about hygiene. I've never been diagnosed with OCD but my roommate has being using that to describe her issues with me. I'm not obsessive like the people who wash their hands hundreds of times a day, but there are certain things I have to do in order to feel clean. The only thing people would consider abnormal is that I don't use razors or toothbrushes more than once. Once I use one, the thought of using it again makes me feel uncomfortable and gross. I buy those cheap disposable one-blade razors in bulk and I get toothbrushes in bulk too.

Today as i am playing video games, i overhear her making phone calls to pet shops and animal shelters asking for birds they have. She called her aunt to ask for money to get another bird, so i tried to stop her saying ""no we shouodn't, its a bad idea right now. We just lost Rosie last night"" i was upset because not only did i find that not healthy, but i saw it as immediately replacing something we both loved. She got annoyed with me and told me it would help her feel better and to grieve. 

We argued back and forth for a bit. My fiance called me an asshole and said i have no say in the matter, which i feel as though i do because i pay the rent and bills in our apartment, money is super tight cause i am the only one working right now, and it would be my money that pays for this bird (we have separate accounts). 

At the moment, we are both upset and not talking. I never mentioned we should never get a pet ever again, i just said it would be best to wait until we have time to properly mourn, and maybe when our finances improve.

1,"AITA for panicking when I found out my S.O. and I didnt have renters insurance? | When I was scrolling through the Progressive mobile app, I noticed that our renters insurance policy was grayed out. Out of my own curiosity, I clicked the insurance button. It said we were covered from September of 2019 to September of 2020. I didn't think much of it after that, but I was still curious, so I decided to click a few of the tabs getting information about the policy it would take me to the website it said my policy can't be reached. So i called the provider, when I gave them my policy information and a few other security things, they told me that my renter's insurance was canceled in January of 2020. I found out that this was due to missing payments. I was then transferred to someone that could write us a new insurance policy.

This is where the whole situation starts to enter the fray.

As I'm on the phone with a new underwriter, he's asking me all the information about the apartment the date it was made, if it was recently renovated or not, how many apartments were in the building stuff for their own information. As I was going over this with him I realized in order for us to even live here, we had to have a mandatory minimum insurance policy of $100,000. My significant other and I, we put all of our money together in One bank account and because I was on the phone I had no way to access the bank accounts without hanging up on the underwriter, so I texted my significant other and the message was and I quote:

""-----, put the stimulus money on the red card right now. This isn't an impulse thing. You need to do this now. I'll call you when everything is done on my end. Thia is very serious, I am on the phone so you can not call me.""

 She responded in about a minute saying her stimulus money was on the card, after I found that information out I went through and went ahead and set up our insurance. $100 initial payment and then $33 every month. I don't like spending a lot of money instantly like that. I wouldn't have made it such an urgent thing, if I didn't just spend about $400 on insurance for our vehicles.

After I get off the phone, I immediately call her, and she starts going off on me because I wouldn't contact her (due to me being on the phone with the underwriter). I let her talk for about 5-10 seconds, and then I let her know everything that was going on. We had no renter's insurance at all, that we could have gotten in a bad situation if something were to happen to our appartment. We didn't have insurance to pay for or protect our well-being, animals, and personal items.

She immediately starts yelling at me and screaming at me that she is at work that I can't do stuff like that to her. It's not even that important at all, and then before she hangs up the phone on me the last thing that she says to me is: 

"" you know I really feel like you're doing this on purpose just to scare me.""

1,"AITA for refusing to apologize after calling my nephew a dumbass? | I have a nephew and holy shit this guy is fucking dumb. He got a rock stuck in his ear, he called some Africans ""chocolate people"" and stuck a chili pepper in his nose. All of this is stuff he did last month and he is 13 years old. The main incident though was he was at a after school daycare and he wanted to get a lip piercing so he got a stapler and stapled his lip and it got stuck. The staff had to call the nurse to come over and they spent 20 minutes trying to get it removed. They had to explain to him getting a piercing is a procedure which requires specialized tools like a very sharp needle thats sterilized or some shit. So the next day he gets a paper clip and sticks it in his lip. His mom (my sister) decided to just get his lip pierced to prevent this from happening in the future. He loops like a fucking idiot. 

I was talking to my brother about it and I said something like ""I can't believe how fucking stupid people can be, that kid is as thick as pig shit"" Brother ""I'm sure glad my daughter isn't this fucking dumb, she's on the honor roll""

Im honest and I don't sugar coat or exaggerate shit nor do I apologize unless I actually fucked up.

0,"AITA for ''encouraging'' my GF to wear a lot of makeup? | I've been with Molly for the past 2 years. She is 30 and I'm 27. She's a ''friend of a friend of a friend'' of my sister and we hit it off at a party but were friends for a while before we got together. 

Molly has quite a distinctive appearance/style. She always wears a huge amount of makeup even when she's just hanging out at home, wears high heels all the time etc. She's also had cosmetic surgery such as breast implants and lip fillers. She had all this before we met so it wasn't my influence. 

While I think she's beautiful, many people don't. She gets a lot of stares and comments in the street, particularly from people of the older generation but also from people our age and younger. Some of my female friends have called the amount of makeup she wears ''hideous'' and said that she looks ''scary''. Needless to say I've cut those people off. Even Molly's own sister refers to her as a ''barbie doll'' 

A lot of people assume that Molly is deeply insecure which is why she covers herself in makeup and had the cosmetics but that's not true at all. It's just her personal style. When we first started chatting she was perfectly happy to send me bare faced selfies without any kind of prompting from me. 

Personally I think she is gorgeous with or without her makeup, but since being with her I found an undiscovered kink of sorts; The idea that I'm the only person who gets to see Molly's bare face feels super special and intimate, like she's saving a part of herself just for me. I've never had any reason to discourage her wearing makeup. She loves wearing it, and I love her wearing it (and not wearing it just as much!)

A lot of people assume Molly is some shallow dumb ''bimbo'' but she really isn't. She is a qualified lawyer working for a big practice and makes 3x as much money as I do (and my earnings are themselves above average)

I had a bit of a row with Molly's mother and sister yesterday, when she was sad about how ''insecure''  her sister was, and then rounded on me saying I need to make an effort to encourage her to go makeup free more often, wear flat shoes etc because she's ''obviously unhappy''. She thinks that I ''encourage'' Molly to do these things simply because I always tell her she's beautiful. If she suddenly decided to never wear heels or makeup again I really wouldn't care, because it was Molly the person that I fell in love with, the way she giggles, smiles, the way her face lights up when talking about something big at work. I've never discouraged her from being who she is because it makes her happy, and who the hell am I to argue with that.

0,"AITA for not wanting to hang out with our new ""friends"" | My wife and I just bought an RV and took it out for the first time. She talks to everyone and everyone loves her and I do love that about her. However... 

She ended up talking to another family near us at the campground. It was an adult man, his parents, and his young cousin. So my wife does her thing and talks to these people for a bit and then they go do their thing and I didn't think much of it. The next day the young man came and asked me if he could borrow some tin foil and I said sure and then he talked my ear off  about nothing in particular. The next thing I know is that his parents are sitting outside our camper telling us their life story and their son's life story. 

Apparently he smoked crack and drank heavily and then found Jesus in prison and now he doesn't drink, do drugs, swear, etc. I have a brother that was in NA and AA and prison and that didn't work for him, my wife has a sister that was in NA and that did work for her. So whatever worked for this guy, cool.

We all had lunch together and then somehow we got talked into going out for fancy coffee with these people and we are sitting around at the coffee shop bullshitting and this guy started talking about how open he is that he's in recovery and about his religion and whatever and I asked him what the most difficult part of that all was for him and he gave me some weird answer about ""sins of the flesh."" - Which is a term that he used a few times and he basically said he's celibate and not interested in dating he just wants to find a person to marry. This was one of the first red flags for me. 

Then he started telling me about his church. I'm not irreligious myself and I'm not against anyone else's. There are some things that make me personally uncomfortable and when he started talking about his church having a shared bank account and such that ticked a couple more red flag boxes for me. Another one was when I bought some stuff to go from this coffee shop. He said something about making sure you have enough money to tip and if you want to go out and get drunk make sure you have enough money for that too which I thought was a weird comment coming from someone in AA. 

ANYWAY we get back to our RV and my wife tells me that they invited us to some concert half a country away with really expensive tickets in a genre we don't like. She also gave them our phone numbers and we have a group text going. 

I told her that I had zero interest in going to this concert, much less spending $100 a ticket and traveling so far for the privilege, and that our new ""friends"" made me uncomfortable. The adult son creeped me out a bit and I have some concerns about his sobriety and his motivations. His parents were great. I told her I'm not going to the concert & I'm not traveling to Bumfuck nowhere to see a band I have no interest in because Mr Sins of the Flesh said we should. Now she's super upset with me and says I'm being a huge asshole.",False,False
0,"AITA For coming home from working and eating without asking my SO if he’s hungry? | My fiancé and I have been together for 10 years, living together for 6. So today I come home from a 10 hour shift and I’m hungry. After I do some quick cleaning and put our 2 year old son to bed I decide to eat. I heat up a plate of food, while he is sitting in the kitchen. We go sit down in the living room to watch Netflix and 10 minutes into a show he gets up angrily and says he’s hungry. He then says, “thanks for asking if I’m hungry” and I apologized and said I didn’t realize he had not ate yet.  He goes and grabs himself a plate, comes back and says that he was trying to be nice and wait for me to get home so we could eat together. He doesn’t always wait for me to come home so we could eat and when he does he will usually say that he waited for me or something. But not today. I asked if he was hungry then why didn’t he say something when he saw me making a plate. He got even more angry and said I’m now turning it around on him and making it seem like it is his fault. I told him I’m tired and hungry and I just want to come home and relax, I don’t want to argue or feel like I have to analyze a situation when I get home so I know what to do and ask if he’s hungry. He said I’m making myself the victim. Now he’s in our room watching Netflix by himself.

0,AITA for asking for a divorce while my wife is in a psych ward | About a week ago my wife intentionally overdosed. She lived. She was committed 5 days later after she received a clean bill of health from the ER/ICU. I knew at that point I could take no more of this in our 10 year marriage and I was done. This has not been her first attempt due to serious mental illness. Nothing has ever gone this far and this was the first time she has been committed. When she was young her mom intentionally overdosed and was successful in her attempt. We have a small child together who was luckily not home at the time. Earlier today I told her it was over.

I do know that she has been a little troubled financially and in some other ways I won't list, but I think her presents should have included some more thought into them instead of simply giving us presents just because of it.

1,"AITA for telling a poorly timed joke about a friend’s dad? | A few months ago a while eating lunch a friend came over who knew my other friends. I had only known him from one class. He stayed with us a few lunches but one day he brought up something unexpected. He stated that his dad was on stage four of cancer.

Here’s where I fucked up. Me and my friend group tend to act edgy and never take each seriously. Edgy being that we always tell stupid jokes that would get us in trouble, you get the point. After the other friend mentioned his father’s situation, I asked, “he’s so close to the last level and beating the game?”

After that he decided to leave. I hadn’t realized the gravity of the situation until that and even though I apologized with responding to me that I wasn’t the one who made him want to leave. 

Here’s where it is really fucked up. Today I learned via social media that his father has passed away and I feel that I’ve definitely fucked up and have a looming feeling that he’s come to hate me and I feel guilty. He never acted as if I was the asshole though but I secretly feel as if he just doesn’t want to deal with me.

And no I’m not putting a TLDR because I just can’t describe the whole situation in ten words",False,False
0,"AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend for inviting me out to sushi but changing his mind on the way there and taking me to Subway instead? | He lives 30 minutes away from me. He invited me to get sushi with him later that night, which I typically can’t afford so I was ECSTATIC. I was already starving and was almost going to get Subway for myself in my own town, but I decided to wait it out for the next few hours to not spoil my appetite. After I drive the 30 minutes to his house still starving, we set out for sushi. Literally on the way there, he said he didn’t want sushi anymore and drove us to Subway. He still offered to pay for me. I couldn’t help feeling really upset, but when I voiced my emotions he criticized me for being ungrateful. I appreciate him paying for me, but I could’ve easily eaten a $5 sandwich hours ago before I had driven half an hour when I was already hungry.

0,"AITA for telling my wife I can’t be going round to different shops to get her preferred ingredients? | 
My wife and I have a 16 w/o baby who understandably is taking up all of our time. First baby for both of us and it’s been quite overwhelming since babs was premature and there have been some touch and go moments with her health. 

My wife has also suffered with a lot of weight loss and decreased appetite so she struggles to find things she likes to eat.

I have been doing all the shopping which at the moment is difficult, you need to queue outside the shops (roughly 30 mins) and then once you’re in follow a one way system in order to get your things. Thereafter you queue up again (about 15 mins) to pay up. 

My wife has been getting a bit aggy with me not only because a) I’m not able to find some things from the shop but b) because I’m not getting her preferred ingredients. For example if she wants Robinson’s jam and there isn’t any I’ll grab Asda jam, but she expects me to go to 2 or 3 different shops in order to get the name brand. 

I did this at first but it’s beginning to get quite tiresome especially because I still have to work (key worker) and my shifts are about 12-13 hours. I’m tired, I don’t want to be running around going to every single different shop. I usually go after work and by that time the shelves are pretty much empty. 

I told her she would unfortunately need to make do for now, cue lots of tears and her raging at me that I have 1 simple job and that’s to feed her and baby and I’m a lazy bastard.

I apologised and said I will always do my best but I honestly can’t go around to 2 or 3 shops every single time we don’t have her preferred brand of rice or whatever- we don’t have any little shops in my area because it’s rural and so I need to travel out to the big shops which are spaced apart and it’s wearing me out. 

She has been passive aggressively texting her mum AND my mum about me and both of these women (who I genuinely am close to) are of the opinion I am the asshole.",False,False
1,"AITA for hurting my girlfriend’s feelings? | So my girlfriend and I were talking about something psychology related, and she told me about an experiment she learned about in one of her psych classes (she’s a psych major). The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like “that’s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been”

We continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn’t like that I’d used the word “obviously” because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn’t know it was obvious. 

The conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. 

She said again that she didn’t know it was that obvious, and it hadn’t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word “obviously” can be offensive, but I don’t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. 

She kept trying to explain to me why using the word “obviously” was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said “I don’t care.” She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don’t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.

She’s waiting for me to apologize, but I don’t think I should have to. I just don’t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn’t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I “tried to invalidate her feelings,” which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. 

I told her I need her to not get offended about such little things.

1,"AITA for not sending my father pictures from a recent vacation. | As a student, I worked my ass off during summer to earn some money instead of sitting around in my room and do nothing for the whole summer and play video games. Few months prior to the start of summer, my friend showed me his photography hobby and I really got engaged. I got really interested and decided that I will dedicate one of my month's pay check to purchase a camera with a few lens. The total was just under two grand.

Fast forward to a ski trip with my family. I took alot of photos of my parents and my siblings. Although uncomfortable, I carried my camera wherever we went and took the risk of me falling down and destroying it just to take a few nice shots. With this in mind, It wasn't as comfortable skiing with camera gear but sure it was my decision.

Fast forward to this week. My father asked me to send him all the pictures that I took so that he could have them on his own personal computer. I politely declined and explained that it wasnt fair for me to spend so much money on a camera, which i paid with my hard earned money, and the fact that I had to carry it non stop wherever we went, which made my ski experience uncomfortable, just so he could have the photos just because he feels entitled to them. He became very pissed and stopped talking to me since. AITA?

1,"AITA for tipping my dad off about his sister being on her death bed, even though it was her possible dying wish that he didn't know about it? | My aunt (dad's sister) and my dad have a complicated relationship. They have been close their entire lives, and are only a couple of years apart in age (mid 70s each). My dad's on the spectrum and he often pisses people off like it's his job.

His relationship with his sister has degraded severely over the last couple of years to the point to where they're not talking any more. I find this to be a pity, but up until now they've both been in very good health, so I thought they'd eventually reconcile after some time apart. My aunt takes slights very seriously and when she decides to be furious with someone it's almost like they're dead to her. My aunt is extremely generous and kind as long as the people in her life actively appreciate the impact that she's made in theirs.

Yesterday I received a message from my mom (divorced from my dad) that my aunt has meningitis and is in the hospital. Also, my cousin has had to drop everything and flew a couple of states over to stay with her in the hospital. I was told explicitly not to tell my father, in all caps. I called my cousin this morning and talked to her about the severity of the situation, my aunt is falling in and out of consciousness and can't deal with a lot of stimulation at the moment, so no one can talk with her except my cousin and my Aunt's BF. When going through everything my aunt said things like, ""don't tell ""my dad"", don't even tell him if I'm dead"". My cousin tried to talk her down from that, but she was having none of that. She's basically staking this out as a final wish kind of demand and the family is taking the request with the utmost seriousness.

I told my cousin that it would be extraordinarily sad if my dad was never given the option to reconcile with his little sister while she was dying. She cried, I cried, and then I told her I wouldn't tell him out of respect for my aunt.

So I spent the day struggling deeply with this knowledge. Eventually, after thinking through what kind of incredible betrayal of my father it would be for everyone else in the family to know about this except for him, and what kind of weight it would be for him to bare if she was to pass away without him even trying to reconnect, I called him. I asked him if there was anything big or new with him, and he replied like everything was great. Then told him that there may be something really big going on, I told him I couldn't give him specifics as to the who or what, but he's smart so he got enough information from me to follow a bread crumb trail that I know exists. I've already had confirmation that he's digging into it.

Even if she won't take his call or my cousin won't let any notification get through to her, my dad at least deserves the opportunity to make up for past mistakes, and at the very least know in his heart his last action towards her wasn't tinted with acrimony. I believe my aunt deserves the same.

So reddit, am I the asshole for basically defying my Aunt's dying wish?",False,False
1,"AITA for how I handled this situation with my daughter in law? | Just for context, I share a house with my husband, son, and his wife and kids. This was a situation we entered out of financial necessity. I know my DIL was not a fan of the arrangement but there really was no choice. 

This resentment she has about the living situation may contribute to her behavior, but I'm not sure.  She has always been a quiet and reserved person who stayed mostly to her part of the house and only came upstairs to use the shared kitchen. I want to see my grandchildren, so I will often come down to visit with them or to do laundry. Even when I come down, she seems disinterested in talking to me and sort of hides away until I leave. 

Anyway, I had been noticing more and more that there will be laundry still in the dryer when I come down to do laundry, or she will have baskets of laundry on the counter or floor. The basket is never empty. I have never gone in there and seen everything washed, dried,and put away. I also noticed that she would leave heavily soiled dishes to soak and ""forget"" to come back to them until the next morning or she would run the dishwasher and not unload it in a timely fashion. 

I got fed up today and I put the dirty dishes in a bucket and the clean ones that were in the dishwasher in a box. I also pulled their laundry out of the dryer and put it in a basket so I could do mine, although it was still wet. I had just had it. 

When my son came home, he noticed these things and lit into me, calling me passive aggressive and giving me a sob story about how his wife has had a kidney infection and between her health and their two young kids, she has had trouble keeping up with house work. I told him that his wife is essentially a lazy 16 year old who can't handle any responsibilities. He didn't take kindly to hearing this, and now his wife won't speak to me because he told her what I said. 

AITA? My son thinks so. I think that his wife needs to step up and use the energy she puts into primping into more practical tasks.",False,False
1,"AITA for criticising my new supervisor | So my ""team"" at work just got a new supervisor. I haven't heard much about her, but lately me and her have been kinda butting heads. 

I'm very simple, I like to work and don't really care for the other stuff, and she's the kind of boss that loves meetings and social stuff. Workwise she's probably my complete opposite, I just get things done, and she wants everything by the book and organized. 

I work best when I'm basically just left to my own devices, as I have been for the 2 years I've worked at my job. She, on the other hand insists on checking in almost hourly through t and has arranged some ""teambuilding"" stuff that I'm kind of dreading.

My buddy, who's on the same team is also not very happy with this woman, and while on break we discussed what we didn't like about her methods. Apparently one of our colleagues that really like her went to her and told her we were ""undermining her authority""? 

She's giving us shit now for ""disrespecting her efforts"", despite her efforts being completely wasted on us. I'm not gonna get fired, she's not in that position, but I don't wanna catch shit with the actual bosses. AITA for criticising my new supervisor?",False,False
1,"AITA for being upset my parents basically lied to me by omission my whole life? | I (23f) just found out that my parents aren’t married, and never were. My mother hates my biological grandfather, who I’ve never met, so she changed her last name to my father’s to further dissolve any association with him. Obviously as his daughter, I was giving his last name, as was my brother(23m) being his son. They refer to each other as husband/wife to others, and wear wedding rings, but have literally never been married. Granted they never specifically told us they WERE married, but I still feel like they lied to me by not telling me the truth. I only found out because I needed their information to apply for FASFA as I’m starting college soon. I always was really proud of my parents - they got together very young and had me, and my brother a little under a year after me, but still stayed together and still love each other. That’s not something that’s usual. When I found out I confronted them and told them they needed to get married, because it doesn’t make sense for them not to. My mother laughed in my face which is so rude and disrespectful, and said, “Girl, go sit your ass down somewhere.” My father just shrugged and said he didn’t see the point, since they’d been together for so long they’re legally considered married even though they never had a wedding or signed a certificate, which is bull.

1,"WIBTA if I signed a lease without my roomate's knowledge when she believes I will be signing one with her? | My roomate and I rent a place from an lady, this lady had made it very clear from the very beginning and even put it on the lease that she only rents for women due to bad experiences she had in the past. She said we could have visitors but she didn't want any men living there.  Me and my roomate agreed to this and it never bothered us. We've been living there for a year and a couple of months now and we had a good relationship with the owner.

That was until 3 months ago when my roomate started dating and started bringing her boyfriend around. At first he would only visit so it wasn't a big deal, then he started sleeping over, then spending a day and day turned into weeks and now he is pretty much living with us. The owner realized what was happening very quickly and came to talk to me saying that if he doesn't leave she won't be rennovating our lease. She said she had tried reaching out to my roomate but she had been ignored. I told this to my roomate and she got very angry saying that they both had a right to live there since she paid rent and he had been buying stuff for the house too and that the terms of the lease were discriminatory bullshit.

This rubbed me the wrong way because she had willingly signed the lease not once but twice now and never made any objections about the rules of the place. Not only this but I don't want to leave this house because it's close to where I work and it's a nice neighborhood. My roomate believes that once our lease is done I will be moving out with her and her boyfriend to a different place since they both can't afford most of the places they've been to by themselves.

0,"AITA for harassing somebody over $300 back? | Backstory: matched with this girl “Laura” on tinder visiting the US from Canada and hit it off. She says she’s in the US to donate her eggs. Once she drops her number she had left town already but tells me I should make a 5 hour drive and stay at her hotel with her. I ask my roommate to watch my two dogs if I go up, roommate was more than cool with it cause she was super hot, so fuck it, I’m going up. 

Right as I’m getting ready to leave my roomie has an emergency and can’t watch my dogs. I text Laura and tell her I can’t go up, nice to almost meet you. Laura texts back and says “bring them.” They’re both big dogs, no way that’s a lot. She convinces me that her hotel is pet friendly and say “of course I want to spend time with a cute guy and his dogs! Once again, I decide fuck it. Worse case shit becomes too much I bounce after a night. I pack the dogs up and make the drive. 

The following morning as I bring the dogs out for a walk, the hotel manager sees me and says the dogs are not allowed back up. She explains that while the hotel is pet friendly, there are special “pets allowed” rooms that you have to pay extra for, and because they were in a non-pet room, there would be a $300 fee for an allergenic cleaning. She says the dogs are not allowed back up unless the fee is paid, otherwise Laurie would be kicked out. 

I let the dogs chill in the back of my Jeep after a long walk + water, then go back upstairs and tell Laura what happened. Laurie freaks and says she can’t pay $300. She had put the hotel expenses on her now maxed Canadian credit card. The egg org is paying her a LOT of money (she says) but they can’t pay or reimburse her until all her appointments are completed. We argued about whose fault it was, but we both knew she was liable, so I could bounce at any point and if I did she’d be left on her own. She promised to pay me back as soon as these egg doctors paid her for her donations. 

Gotta tell ya, I really wanted to just GTFO and leave her in the dust, but I didn’t. I gave her $300 cash to pay bc I didn’t want my name attached. The trip ended up being me basically driving her around to hospitals the whole time and not anything fun. She wasn’t really open about the extent of how much driving around she needed. Before I left she reiterated that she’s “not a shitty person” and she’d pay me back. 

This was two months ago and after I left it’s been me hitting her up weekly for my money back. As many of you (and me) could guess, I’m either being ignored or told a) she needs more time, or b) it’s my fault and she shouldn’t owe me money. Oh and now she’s in fucking Ecuador according to Instagram. Who’s the asshole?

TL;DR: hot girl openly invited me and my dogs to her pet friendly hotel that turned out to be only kind of pet friendly. She gets charged $300 for my dogs in her hotel room. I let her borrow $300 and after promising to pay me back she now says it’s my fault bc they’re my dogs. AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for “forcing my veganism” on my boyfriend? | I don’t think I’m as terrible as he makes me out to be.

I’ve been vegetarian my whole life and went full vegan about a year ago. I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 4 years now. During this four years he’s lived with his mom and family and later his sister and her family, I’ve lived alone just me and my daughter. We’ve started to get more serious in the last 6 months or so, with him staying over almost every night and we’re talking about upgrading my studio to a two bedroom so he can officially move in and we’ll have enough room. 

When we go out to eat, he gets whatever he wants to eat of course and I don’t make any sort of judgment on his food choices. We had leftovers once and I asked him not to store them in my fridge and take them home, since I like to keep my home meat free. He understood and did so without hesitation. Early this year we had a trip to Miami planned and this was when we really started taking about him moving in with me. He said that he wanted to start eating healthier and when we came back from Miami he would adopt a vegan diet so I could cook for all of us. I was glad to hear this, but when we came back from our trip he didn’t change his diet at all and started staying over at my house more so at least that part was still on.

Earlier this week he went grocery shopping for us and brought home some frozen shrimp and chicken breasts to cook for himself. I know he’s been staying at my house a lot lately but I thought this was disrespectful towards me and my home in that ended up causing a huge fight between us since he thinks I’m forcing my lifestyle into him. I really did hope he was going to stick to what he had said about going vegan, but I haven’t been giving him any flack about his diet. I don’t think it’s too much to ask for him not to bring meat into the house to cook on the same stuff I use for my food, and the smell of meat cooking (depending on what it is) makes my stomach turn.

So, am I the asshole? Would I be the asshole to want this rule in place, no meat in the house, when we get our apartment together?",False,False
0,"WIBTA for declining to be a groomsman in a close friends wedding? | A friend I’ve known for about 10 years or so is getting married next month, and invited me out to dinner to “catch up” since it had been about a year since we hung out last. We chatted over dinner and after a while he asked me if I liked Kershaw knives. We’re both pretty outdoorsy and dabble a bit in the prepper life so it wasn’t an odd question to ask, and I responded with yes. He then slid a knife to me and asked me to check it out. I open it up and check out the craftsmanship, noticing an engraving on the blade. It was engraved with “ *lastname’s* wedding : 4-25-20 - Groomsman” and he had a big smile on his face when he saw I noticed it. He then asked me excitedly to be a groomsman for his wedding. 

Some additional context before getting into this next part. I’m the one who set him up with his fiancé, who happens to be very close friends to my ex, and you can kinda see where this is going. 

My ex was very mentally and emotionally abusive to me over a long period of time. It took me a while to realize it and I dumped her 2 years ago with no contact afterward at all. She is going to be a bridesmaid in their wedding and I’m not sure I want to put myself in that environment. Would I be the asshole for declining to be a part of their wedding?

Every time we go grocery shopping we each pick out some kind of treat. I'm pickier than my wife so usually she'll pick out something I don't like while I pick something we both like. She's not picking things I don't like on purpose, it's just what she's craving. The problem is she always wants to eat some of what I picked too.

Most recently we got two containers of ice cream and when my wife picked chocolate ice cream(I know I'm weird for not liking chocolate ice cream) I told her she couldn't have any of my ice cream. We went back and forth for a while with her saying that she wasn't forbidding me from eating her ice cream so it was stingy of me hoard mine, and I was saying it wasn't fair for her to have a bowl of the ice cream I picked out because I didn't want any of hers.

She had a backup so it never affected her work but she said she would save up for a replacement of comparable quality to that one because it meant a lot to her.

I thought I'd be a good husband and today, for her birthday, I gave her a guitar. I bought it two weeks ago and kept it hidden until this morning. I don't know much about guitars so I tried to get something a similar color to the one that was stolen and let the shop employee guide the rest of my purchase. I spent $600, her guitar that was stolen was $1800.

She got upset at me for ""spending \[our\] money foolishly"". She said she'll never use it because it's not the same or even close to what she had or has in other guitars. This sounds like NTA territory but she followed it up with ""you should never buy someone a musical instrument because it's a personal decision"" which made me question whether I made the right choice at all. 

She told me she appreciated my attempt to help but this was money spent that will go to no use, and if I wanted to do this again, talk to her beforehand. She said we could have pooled our money and got a replacement for what she had stolen.

I don't know anything about guitars or even instruments in general. If it wasn't a good guitar I'm sure she could upgrade it or something to be good, right? It's a pretty piece of wood with strings on it, isn't that what determines the price? She doesn't think so and now I have to try and return this when I know it's past the return/exchange period.

Was I the asshole?",False,False
1,"WIBTA If I set up a gift registry for my housewarming? | Throwaway just because...

A few months ago I purchased a place of my own. It took me many years of saving and restricting myself. It was a massive life achievement for me as I've had very few other milestones. I'm single and never been in a long term relationship. Now that I'm in my mid-30s, I'm feeling more and more like I'll never find ""the one"" and get married. At the very least I likely won't get married for a few more years.

My friends, on the other hand, are all married and are in the midst of having their first, second or third child/ren.

While I'm always happy for all of them and their life achievements, I feel like I'm constantly buying presents for them - engagements, weddings, baby showers, first birthdays.

I'm wanting to host a housewarming next month and invite all my friends. I don't have heaps of things that I need for my place yet (I previously was living with a friend who charged me little rent and had all his own stuff) and while I have a bit of money saved up to buy things, there's a lot I still need.

1,"AITA - secretly feeding neighbors dog without telling him. | I have a neighbor who lives 2 houses down, it’s a single man in his 60’s, who has a toy poodle dog for around 4 years now.  The toy poodle has been losing a lot of weight. It was never overweight but I guess the neighbor got brainwashed into a “doggy diet” that the vet told him to do. He severely limits the food he gives his dog. He takes the dog for a walk every night. The dog is slow and seems lethargic. It became more noticeable over this summer so I decided to do something. 

My neighbor has a fence that is unlocked and my neighbor will let him go out and play in the yard around the same time every night. I bring the dog over ham, cheese, bacon, turkey, and chicken and throw it over the fence every night. The dog gobbles it up like there’s no tomorrow. I feel like the dog is hungry.

0,"AITA for telling my gf she’s not allowed to eat sugary snacks in our bed anymore? | Going to try and keep this to the point. My girlfriend is one of those people who loves curling up in bed and throwing a fluffy blanket over herself and watching tv. 

She also eats a LOT of snacks in bed. Popcorn, sugary doughnuts, chips, chocolate, cookies, you name it she’ll snack in bed. She works from home so as soon as she’s done with work she’ll crawl into bed and kind of ‘nest’. 

It’s been upsetting me majorly because she never dusts the bed down and there are ALWAYS. CRUMBS. On my side of the bed. It’s uncomfortable, gross, I dislike it, and I have asked her to stop multiple times. I was never raised to eat in bed so it’s weird for me. Each time she’s countered with ‘ok I’ll dust the bed down more thoroughly’ or ‘I’ll vacuum more often’ etc. 
As a method of deflecting what I’m asking. 

I work REALLY long shifts so whenever I come home I literally have a bite to eat and need to sleep. This kind of escalated last night because I came into bed and there were crumbs EVERYWHERE on my side. I pulled back my covers and there was sugary shit all over my damn bed. 

I ended up sleeping on the sofa because she was already asleep and I was too tired to dust everything down, and this morning I flat out told her that I no longer want her to eat in bed and it’s non negotiable. She thinks I’m being a mean controlling asshole, I think I’m not!",False,False
0,"AITA for not going to my best friend and housemates hen party? | I live with my best friend (let’s call her Stephanie) and her now fiancé (I’ll call him dave) , I pay rent for a room in the house they own together. Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.

They both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.

They got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn’t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.

I do not like Stephanie’s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn’t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.

I enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.

Stephanie’s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for £350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn’t afford it Stephanie’s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back £60 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The £350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.

I do not have £350, I do not have £60 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back £55 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don’t buy clothes, I don’t go out for dinners, I don’t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.

I approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can’t afford the hen do, and that I just didn’t know how I was going to afford to go.

Dave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or “sell a limb” to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was “being negative” that I would “upset her mum who offered to pay to be nice” and that I’m “ruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl”


I laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra £60 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can’t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I’ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I’ll be in more debt if I go.

AITA if I say I just can’t afford it and I’m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don’t want to hurt my finances but I don’t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around £200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal.

0,"AITA for wanting credit on my husband's weight loss? | So my husband recently lost a ton of weight rather quickly. He had the willpower, did 1-2 of intense exercise every night, ate less and did it. 

Proud of him. 

But...

He recently started bragging to everyone that it's SO easy to lose weight, you just have to eat right, no excuses. This irritates the shit out of me, because he didn't prepare any of his food. 

I do all the grocery shopping, so he was already used to only eating what I buy. When he said he wanted to lose weight i stopped buying the snacks. I had to plan my week around roasting his chicken, which took 4 hours at a time. I altered all the families dinners or made him separate meals to comply with his diet. All up I spent 6 to 10 hours a week just prepping his food. 

I cringe every time he brags about his weight loss, because he sounds like such a Gwenyth Paltrow. A lot of people can't invest that much time into food prep. I know it is extremely hard to lose weight and exercise while being hungry. He definitely did his part in his weight loss. But it wouldn't have been that easy if I wasn't helping out.

1,"AITA for not wanting to help my ex wife out more monetarily or with extra time now that our son has a time consuming medical condition. | When we first got divorced our son was 4. He was perfectly healthy and she got primary custody. I asked for a received every other weekend. The court ordered me to pay a set amount of child support a month. I pay it. She carries health insurance and pays for day care. I just pay the court ordered amount that lines up with my income. 

About a year ago he started having seizures. Some of them lasted a long time which led to some hospitalizations. That led to a host of appts at specialist and she took a leave from work to deal with it all. 

I work erratic hours and go to college so although I visited him at the hospital a few times.  I couldn’t make it to the appts. 

The medical bills came rolling in and she asked me to help. I don’t have any more money so I told her no. She asked me to watch him sometimes so she could go back to work and make up some hours so she could pay the bills. I told her to get a babysitter. She said she couldn’t afford one. I can’t see him during the week because of my school schedule and work schedule so I told her no. The court order says nothing about medical bills and me having to pay half. 

Now she wants to enroll him in some kind of summer camp for kids with epilepsy because she said sending him to a regular daycare is hard since they often don’t know how to deal with his seizures. She asked if I could at least help pay for some of it. Even a small portion. Again, I’ve no money so I said no. 

Now she wants to be in a medical trial for the seizures but the doctor won’t let her in unless he can meet with me but he can only meet with me during the week. They are claiming it is because there are overnights involved. I am busy then. I also think the study isn’t necessary. Medicine is controlling them mostly. 

I am poor college student. I just don’t have the money. She says I am an asshole for only paying the bare minimum and never helping out more. My argument is that I pay child support as ordered and I take my every other weekend. I do my part. I do what is required. I am not her partner anymore and I don’t think it is my job to help her out.

It was the only remaining seat at the library as it was packed (due to finals week).  While I was working, the 3 girls asked me to watch over their items as they would go on a break for around 5-10 minutes. I said sure and continued on working. The strange thing was that the girls would not come back for more than 30 minutes. I had to go soon and when I had left, it was around 50 minutes since they had not come back. Well, it turns out, the girls went to my school and recognized me. They told me that someone had stolen their laptops and other items and they were asking me to take responsibility for these items as I had promised them that I would watch over their items.

1,"AITA for refusing a student an extension on a paper, despite her learning disability? | I am a neurobiology professor at a large, well-known university. While it is not exclusive, it is known for its very high academic standards, and degrees from here are very attractive to employers. 

In my upper year course this semester, there is a young woman that has repeatedly asked for extensions on assignments. Since it is a small class, I know each student, and she is the student that has shown me the least promise. She is late for class, misses class far too frequently, very rarely participates, and when she is called upon she rarely has anything insightful to add to the conversation. Her grades are mostly C's. 

She has a recommendation from our disability services office to be allowed extra time on assignments and exams due to a supposed learning disability. If she has a disability though, I do not think she needs these accommodations as much as she says she does. I honestly think she's just lazy, unmotivated, and not very bright. It is not difficult to obtain a disability note from a doctor. And every time she emails to ask for the extension, she reminds me the note exists. No, I do not know the details of her disability, just that her doctor says she has one. 

On her most recent paper, she asked for an extension four days before it was due. I denied it, and on the due date she submitted her paper, unfinished. A week later she dropped the course. Apparently she complained to the head of the department, because he wants to meet with me this week.

1,"AITA for buying an AK-47 with part of my bonus money? | Good afternoon reddit. I figure this is the best sub for the latest drama between my sister, roommate and myself (technically, they are both my roommates). 

I guess to dispel stereotypes I should say upfront, I'm 24, female and a college grad looking for a more permanent job. I work at a national chain restaurant and actually love my job. I have a group of regular customers that I really, really love, my bosses are amazing and it's a great company. So anyways, for the past month our manager had a contest that the person who could get the most comment cards or online surveys filled out would get a $500 bonus. Since my regulars are so awesome, I easily won and he gave me cash at the lunch shift Thursday. So I've basically had $500 burning a hole in my pocket ever since. 

So today one of my regulars had just come in from the shooting range. I told him that I'd never even held a gun before but I always though they were super cool. He asked me if I'd like to come shooting with him some day. I said yes. He then asked if I could come to the parking lot with him and I could see and hold his guns. I took a break and it was like...holy crap he literally had a car full of guns. I really liked the AK-47 he had, just something about it totally drew my eye. So I complimented on it. He asked if I wanted it. I told him to stop joking with me. He said he wasn't joking at all and that he would give it to me for always being so nice to him. I told him about my bonus money and he said well to be fair he'd sell it to me for $200. I was like cool. So I went from never even holding a gun in my entire life to now i'm the proud freaking owner of an AK-47! My friend is going to take me shooting with it on Wednesday afternoon and I'm so excited. 

So I just got off shit and my sister and roommate are furious with me. They say it should have been implied that we never bring guns into the house. I told them we never talked about it. They both said exactly and basically ""banned"" me from bringing my gun into the house. Which to me is utter bullshit because I pay rent as well and I have the right to have whatever I want as long as it's legal in my space.

1,"AITA for Using A Laundromat's Quarter Machine? | So I'm a frequent customer at a laundromat. Nothing special about it, but it's near my house and gets the job done. Well, it's important for me to always have a stash of quarters around. If not for laundry, then when I wash my car, grab a newspaper, or the parking garage is full and I need to use the meters on the street. The laundromat has a quarter machine and I regularly convert $20 to quarters.

I had done my laundry just a few days ago but was running low on quarters, so I popped in quickly to get some. Out comes who I assume is the manager (I'd never seen this man before, but I'd never been there that early in the day), who asks if I planned to use the quarters at the laundromat. Startled by the confrontation, I quickly replied ""No."" I mean, I planned to us some of them at some point for laundry, but I felt like he was asking if I was going to turn around immediately and use them on the machines, so I defaulted to an honest answer. No.

When I said ""no,"" he responded with ""Don't ever come back. I don't have enough quarters for my customers as it is."" We had an audience at this point. I replied with ""Okay. Thanks."" and left.

Finding a new laundromat isn't a big deal. It's just that the confrontation has been nagging me. Was I really wrong for exchanging a $20 for quarters using a quarter machine? I hate to think I was taking quarters from his customers and hurting his business. But also, is it my responsibility to maintain his quarter supply? I am hindering his ability to maintain his quarter supply? I don't think I decreased his profit, but was he upset that I wasn't increasing it by giving the money right back to him? Did he overreact by telling me to never come back, as opposed to telling me they were running low on quarters and he'd prefer I only used the quarters at the laundromat?

I follow Julie on Instagram. For the past year and a half or so she has been working on an oil painting, and I saw her posted up with the final result. It was absolutely breathtaking. I fell in love with it and showed my husband, who loved it too. I DMd her and wanted to ask her what she thought about selling it. I saw how hard she worked on it and I know she saved her coins for the materials. We agreed on a price of $650, which I think is reasonable for an emerging artist.

I guess Julie told her Dad and her sister about it. My brother called me up and asked me to buy something from Lily too. I honestly thought that he was joking so I laughed when he said it but he got mad. He said that it’s not fair to gift one child something and not gift it to the other.

My mom also had me pick out her dress. My dad and brother don’t care what they wear, so I chose khakis and polos for them (it’s not a fancy thing).

My best friend, for the record, lives in the area of this vacation spot. She doesn’t have to travel and it’s like a half hour drive. I’m paying for the dinner later and her flowers. All I asked was that she buy a $30 dress I found online, to wear to the ceremony and dinner, because it sort of goes with the other outfits. She got a little offended and said that she wasn’t a bridesmaid or MOH, so I couldn’t ask her to wear anything specifically. I offered to pay for the dress and she said that it was fine, she’d pay for it and wear it, but I was being a bridezilla, trying to dictate outfits when I didn’t have a wedding party.

Lori is here at the BBQ and one of her husband's former co-workers kindly asked her how she was doing and told her that he misses her husband. As soon as they started talking this fringe friend, Kate, swooped into the conversation. I had the impression that Kate actually wanted the attention of the co-worker guy. She kept trying to tell Lori how ""she knew exactly what she was going through because she got divorced this year"". (Side note, Kate's husband left because she's was caught cheating). Any comment that Lori said, Kate seemed to have to one-up it. For instance- Lori cut all of her hair off after the accident and uses her hair growth as a physical reminder that time and life are moving on. The co-worker guy complimented that Lori ""looks like she's doing well"". And that she ""looked like a real badass when she shaved her head."" Kate chimed in ""after my divorce, the grief was just too much, I had to go blonde. I just needed the change."" I finally said ""Kate, divorce really isn't the same as death. I don't doubt that you've been through tough times. But it's not the same."" She gave me the most affronted look, and then looked at the co-worker guy and rolled her eyes about my comment. Then she immediately walked over the host of the bbq. The host came to me a few minutes later and said that I shouldn't have brought up her divorce because it's ""sensitive information"" and I was extremely rude for attacking Kate like that.

so one day i had enough of his disrespect and picked up everything i bought him and sold it to a friend, my mother called me heartless and that was the worst thing i could have ever done, and 2 days after bought him another computer, his behavior has not changed and he still acts the same, calling my mother a bitch and all that.

0,"AITA for walking out on my date? | I'm posting via a throwaway account. 

The past year has been very difficult for me. I experienced an extremely messy breakup with my girlfriend after I discovered that she had been cheating on me with a mutual friend. For reasons that I will not explain in this post, the breakup was extremely messy and resulted in me losing the close-knit friendship group which we shared. For some time, I was in a very dark place which I only got out of with the help and support of my school friends. My confidence and self-esteem definitely took a beating, however in recent months I've begun to feel a lot better about myself. Recently, I downloaded Tinder in the hope that I could start dating again. 

After a few false starts, I got talking to a girl. At face value, it seemed that we had loads in common: shared interests, similar taste in music and film, etc. One thing that seems particularly significant now (but didn't strike me as such then) was the fact that she paid close attention to my job. I work in finance and earn a high salary. Nevertheless, we decided to meet each other in person. I decided to book a table at a very nice restaurant, expecting to cover the cost of the date. I should mention, for reasons that you'll understand later, that this is the sort of place where people wear extremely formal clothing (suits and ties are the norm for men). It is also worth mentioning that my friends and I dine here quite regularly and thus are on very good terms with the staff. My friends were dubious about the amount of effort which I put into this date, but their cynicism did not dissuade me. 

Soon enough, the big night rolled around. Given the nature of the establishment (something which I forewarned my date about) I put a lot of effort into my appearance, donning a suit and tie. I expected her to do the same. You can imagine my surprise when, upon meeting in the bar, I found that she had put absolutely no effort into her appearance at all. In a room of smartly-attired people, she wore jeans, trainers and a baggy jumper. I immediately sensed something was off but pushed ahead with the date. Once we were seated I attempted to strike up a conversation only to get monosyllabic responses when she wasn't disinterestedly scrolling her phone. When the waiter came around to take our order she listed off some of the most expensive items on the menu including a £200 bottle of champagne. My patience snapped. I felt that I had been completely played. The only reason why she had agreed to come out on a date with me was to snag an expensive meal. As such, I pretended to excuse myself so as to go to the bathroom. Instead, I headed for the door where I met the maître d who I know relatively well. After explaining the situation, I paid for my share of the meal and left without so much as sending my date a text to tell her I was leaving. About ten minutes later, she figured out what was happening and sent a stream of vulgar and abusive messages.

0,"AITA for kicking a guy out of my house because he was insulting me | So my girlfriend and I had some people over last night, four of her friends and one of mine who had nothing better to do.

We were just relaxing in the living room after dinner, chatting and deciding what we wanted to do next. My girlfriend was sitting next to me and was gently stroking my back, which I like.

One of my girlfriends friends apparently took issue with this and said that it was gay(?? Having a girlfriend is gay?). I haven’t talked to the guy much, only heard about him tangentially when my girlfriend goes and tells me about it after. He’s always been unavailable when I’ve done anything with my girlfriends friends.

So I asked him what the fuck that’s supposed to mean and he said that my girlfriend is acting like the “man” in the relationship. But then he said he’s only fucking around.

My friends and I fuck with each other by “insulting” each other but we’ve known each other since high school, so we all know we don’t mean it.

Anyway I just ignored it and we played twister(not my choice, her friends picked it). My girlfriend and I ended up in a tangled position where she was behind me with her chest on my back reaching for a color.

So of course the guy takes it upon himself to comment and say that it must be just like how we are in bed.

I again asked him what it was supposed to mean and he says that I probably like taking it up the ass(somehow he got this from my girlfriend rubbing my back and a twister game).

I finally lost it and yelled at him and ended up booting him out and telling him to not come back. I mean the guy was like the stupid meme(fellas, is it gay to have a girlfriend?) personified. I didn’t even know people actually acted like that.

That sort of put a damper on the night and everyone else trickled out over the next 10 minutes. I don’t know why my girlfriend is friends with this guy but I’m not going to tell her to stop talking to him.

Anyway today she told me that she’s been getting heat from her friends, and the guy has been telling her to break up with me because I’m an asshole(????). She’s been okay about it with me but her friends are apparently going nuts.

Should I have just ignored it? AITA?",False,False
1,"AITA for making remark that ""you can't tell the difference anyways?"" | Hey, personally very much into coffee-making (The ground your own beans, pour-over, third wave stuff). And own 20-30$ coffee beans, which comes at 3-4$ per cup. I very much wanted to introduce the world to my younger sister, and have been encouraging her to try it out, to which she does and have been making it a habit to do.

Recently, found out she drinks the beans, with ice and milk. Wells, that's not how we drink lightly roasted $3 per cup of joe. And one day, while I was just making a simple Nescafe, milk, and ice (20 cents), the way she makes it. She tried it and tells me that she can't tell the difference. (To my horror, cause it's a 3$ and 20 cents difference per day. I then made a suggestion that she should just use Nescafe then, since she can't tell the difference, and it's rather costly to my coffers at $3 a day, she shrugged and walked off. Continuing with the 3$ a day.  


Yesterday, I made a remark to her that I'll just get her some cheaper beans, which she can continue to enjoy the way she likes while hurting my wallet less. I repeated the words ""you can't tell the difference anyway!"" to her, rather snarkily with a serious gesture.  
She's now hurt. I'm wondering if AITA, or is she just over-sensitive, where it makes all economical sense to just do something that's cheaper if ""we can't tell the difference anyway"" and where it's at another person's expense.

1,"WIBTA if I asked the father of my child (I’m 4 months pregnant, he is not my BF) not to date anyone for the next 12 months? | I don’t know if it’s just hormones making me crazy or if my concerns are reasonable so guys please tell me what you honestly think.

I’m currently 4 months pregnant with my first child. The pregnancy is accidental and the father is one of my good friends. Abortion is not an option for me and he respects that. We are on the same page about making the best of the situation, and our priority is ensuring that we can be the best parents to our child even if we’re not together. Our families are supportive of us and are excited about the prospect of a grandchild, as none of our parents are grandparents yet.

My pregnancy has not been the easiest and I recently moved in with my child’s father (I’ll call him Lance) so someone can stay with me most of the time (he works from home). We’ve been getting along well, but sometimes it makes me feel uncomfortable when Lance tells me about the girls he’s talking to on Bumble. 

For the record, I don’t think he’s doing it with the intention of being rude to me. I think it’s just a habit that he’s used to - as I said, Lance and I are good friends and in the past we would always talk about the people we like or we’re seeing – maybe he just doesn’t think that anything would change now that we have a baby on the way. I get where he’s coming from and I know he still has a life to live outside of being a father to our child, but reasonably or unreasonably I feel uncomfortable that he is looking for a romantic relationship now when I think that our attention should be focused on preparing for our baby (converting a room into his nursery if we continue to live in Lance's apartment, learning how to change diapers/bathe a baby, etc). 

I’ve been thinking about asking Lance if he can hold off dating until our baby is about six months old.  I think that by that time we would have adjusted to having a baby and can have time for dating. At least that’s the timeline I’m thinking for myself, though I understand that my decisions for myself shouldn’t also automatically apply to Lance.

0,"AItA for not blocking guys from looking at my girlfriend and not taking pics of her | Me and I girlfriend recently went to this super nice place in Korea. There were 2 places in particular this happened. Also I paid for this tour to surprise her cause she loves naturey stuff. 

First place was in a garden and she loved it and was taking a bunch of pics and she recently got a selfie stick and was using that. I was just taking pics of the whole area, I'd let her go about and we'd take a pic together when she asked. Near the end of that, she was over the place, she said how I never took pictures of her and she's alway the one doing the selfies with us or asking me to do it rather than me doing it first. 

I've never been the type to take pics of myself. Rather see where I'm at then my own face. I don't know. Eventually she cooled down and we went to the next place. 

First off my girlfriend was wearing a shirt showing most of her back and some shorts. Nothing to crazy like her ass hanging out or anything in my opinion.

As the day went on at this place, she was visibly getting more and more upset. And I asked her what's wrong, and she said guys are just staring at her. I was kind of oblivious to it as I was just enjoying the scenery around us till she pointed it out. I said something along the lines of they're gonna look at us but they're not doing anything to us and there's just so many people here. 

Moments later she's just fuming mad, almost yelling with people around us and goes off saying how I'm not protective at all or care about her and that I should cover her from guys looking at her. Mind you, this is a very touristy area, there's people in every direction.

We eventually go into a gift shop and I buy a scarf for her and she covers her back.

I pointed out that she doesn't read anymore and therefore is not a book nerd, and shoud make a different username.

1,"AITA For going to a funeral of someone I didn't like? | Basically growing up, my uncle was a real asshole to me. Because he was close to my family, he was around a lot and would often embarrass me or lose his temper easily. For example, he threw a pool party and as a joke, went around telling my brothers and sisters/other cousins that I pee'd in the pool. Obviously not a big deal now, but as an 8 year old it was extremely embarrassing. And it was like he'd always single me out as I didn't see him doing this stuff to my other family nearly as much. 

When I got older, I stopped being around him as much and that upset him I guess. Recently he ended up passing in a car accident. My family is understandably devastated and I am there for them, but when it came time for the funeral, I told them I didn't want to go.

I was called selfish and told ""it's not just about your uncle, it's about being there for people grieving too."" Eventually I gave in and went.

The funeral was pretty big as my uncle was popular. I decided to be honest about my feelings toward my uncle if anyone asked since I was basically guilted into going. Someone eventually did say to me ""how are you taking his loss?"" And I told them ""It hasn't really affected me, he was a real prick"" which was poor timing on my part as I realized my grandmother was standing nearby (his mother). 

I joined a conversation going on and they were talking about stories of my uncle in his younger days. I chimed in and told them about how shitty of a person he was to me (mentioned the pool story to them).

Eventually word was getting around and my dad came up to me and told me to stop saying bad stuff about my uncle. I told him ""I am just being honest, you wanted me to come after all."" This set him off and he told me to ""get the fuck out"" loud enough that people standing near us were watching. 

I told him I'll leave and he escorted me to the exit like I was a toddler, as I left I told him ""I hope your brother is burning in hell"" because admittedly, I was a little angry too that I am supposed to suddenly respect my uncle even though my complaints about him as a child always fell on deaf ears.

Basically, he has bipolar disorder and he's always moping around about everything and just in general he's always thinking irrationally. We were just talking about this thing on the news about a kid who committed suicide. That's where it kinda took a turn and he said that he can relate to them. I was already irritated because he changed the topic to something depressing like usual. He also just destroyed the mood. I regret saying it but we started having an argument about it and I was just trying to explain to him that he needs to stop talking about his mental health when he denies to take medication. It ended with me saying that if he's so depressed and if he hates his life so much, to kill himself. I caught on immediately and apologized but he was already hurt by it.

0,"AITA for giving my son ~$15,000 when he turned 18 and moved out, but refuse to give the same amount to my daughter? | My 19-year old daughter Vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. Now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they’ve never don’t ever SEE each other besides a few quick weekend visits. Moreover, they’ve only dated for a little more than a year. 

I told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

The problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn’t have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn’t have to work at all during the school year. 

Since I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

She now says that she’s moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT). She said that now she’s not going to school, she’d rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

I told her I cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. If/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she’s married, I’ll be happy to contribute the money. But it’s not just a free handout.

She’s got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he’s always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiancé, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.

Well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. My wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but I told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and I rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and WHEN she has to move back home. I don’t want her to think I support this decision.

She told me she sorta saw my point, but she’s not going to help me unravel this mess with my Vanessa, she’s staying out of it. I, on the other hand, think she’s acting like a spoiled brat. AITA for sticking to my guns on this?",False,False
1,"AITA for expecting family who comes to visit our 3 month old to help us around the house as well | This is more of are we the assholes as my wife and I are on the same page here. We have a 3 month old who is the only grand child on my side of the family, and the only one in the state on hers, so we have a lot of family looking to come and visit frequently.  Our families live 1-2 hours away so it’s usually more like day visits instead of quick visits.  

Obviously, with me working full time and my wife staying home with a baby who needs almost constant care (along with a 9 month old puppy) and also working a part time remote job, certain house keeping items can fall through the cracks and we get behind.  I will point out that we do keep a clean house, I come home from work most nights and tackle either dishes or laundry, and we pick up the clutter and vacuum pretty regularly.

Our mindset is that if family members come to visit for the day on a weekend, we expect them to do more than just hold the baby, but actually help out by maybe doing the dishes, switching laundry to the dryer, taking the dog for a walk, etc just so we can lean on their support for a small break from all the stuff that piles up.  Some family members are super giving with their time/efforts and are happy to help, but my wife’s mom and step dad basically expect to come and hold the baby without doing anything else.  We have to specifically ask them to do things if we want them to help, and if they do it it’s usually with a pretty snarky/put off attitude.

This was capped off last night when they came to babysit while we went to my company’s Christmas party, and as we were all dressed up and heading out the door, my MIL called out to my wife for help because our son had a poopy diaper and she made us change it before leaving. It’s a small thing but it made my wife confront them about not being helpful when they come to visit, and her mom responded that “that’s not what grandmas are for” and that if we need help we should just hire people for it (they are pretty well off, but we don’t have money for a nanny or anything.)

0,"AITA for cutting off my sister after her miscarriage | Earlier this year, I (20F) was diagnosed with a somewhat rare genetic illness that effects connective tissue. It causes chronic pain, and I am very frequently dislocating bones, it also causes pregnancy to be high risk.

When I was diagnosed, I decided not to have children. I live in constant pain, and I don't wish to pass on my genes to children. I shared this with my sister at least 2 years ago as we have been extremely close since childhood. 

Last month, she had a first trimester miscarriage, and has since found out that due to lesions on her ovaries and in her uterus, it's unlikely she'll ever have children. After this, she called me, extremely upset. During this conversation she mentioned living vicariously through me and my children. I told her I don't plan on having children (again) due to my disorder. She essentially accused me of perpetrating eugenics (?), Saying I was playing god, and saying that children with disabilities shouldn't be born. Given it was so soon after she was told she most likely wouldn't be able to have kids, I took it as grief speaking, however in the 5 conversations we've had since, every time she has made a comment to this effect and frankly, I'm tired of being her punching bag.

1,"AITA for getting “revenge” on my boyfriend cheating on me by reading his really “cheesy” poems on Instagram and tagging his new girlfriend? | I don’t know how much detail you guys need since this isn’t a relationship question but rather my behavior after. So I mean the short version is my boyfriend cheated on me then started dating the girl after he dumped me. I was devastated, I’m still hurt over it. 

Over the course of our relationship he would write me these really bad poems. Even though I was in love, I knew they were bad but I loved that he took the time to write them for me. 

A few weeks ago I was finally coming to terms that I couldn’t forgive him and it was over and I was getting rid of his stuff. I came across the poems and started reading them to myself and it just sounded hilarious because they are awful. So I did one on video and it really made me laugh and feel good so I did one on Instagram and got a few likes so I did several more and posted them. But this time I tagged he and his new girlfriend.

Well nearly everyone thinks I went too far with tagging them. I guess she didn’t react well because the poems were so personal and I revealed things I guess she didn’t know and she either is planning on or has dumped him. 

It was a relief in the moment but now I feel bad. Was I the asshole?",False,False
1,"AITA for being naked in my apartment when I knew a friend was coming over? | So, I need your guys’ help, because I’m honestly not sure if I’m the asshole here or not.

So, this happened a couple months ago. I (25M) had just gotten out of the shower and was drying off in the living room; after drying my hair, I just left the towel hanging on my shoulders, so I was completely naked otherwise. But I was the only one home, and I felt comfortable, so no big deal right? I sat down on the couch, while still naked, and was just scrolling on my phone.

Unfortunately, while I was still sitting on the couch naked, my roommate (24M) and our friend (25F) came home. They both walked into the apartment, and saw me sitting there naked, with my dick and balls out for all to see. My roommate and I see each other nude all the time (not in a weird way, just we’ve been friends forever so we don’t care), but this friend of ours certainly hasn’t, so she gasped. I jumped up, embarrassed, covered myself with my towel, and ran into my room.

Here’s where I might be the asshole: I knew that they would be coming over at about that time, but I got distracted by phone and stayed in the living room too long. Now our friend is telling me that she thinks I did it on purpose, like to get off on exposing myself to her, and she doesn’t want to hang out with us anymore.

0,"AITA for not paying for my daughter to pursue her theatre aspirations? | So my wife and I have four kids, and we told them all that we’d pay for all their education as far as they want to pursue it, but after that they’re financially on their own.  Our two oldest graduated from med school and law school debt free, and our third is currently an undergrad.  Our youngest daughter didn’t want to go to college, but wants to have a career in musical theater, and wants to move to New York to audition for plays.  We live in California, and she’s gotten a few minor parts in some plays, so it’s not like her goals are unrealistic. 

However, she’s just working as a waitress for now (not that there’s anything wrong with that), and wouldn’t be able to afford to move to New York and support herself on her own.  She asked if we could give her some of the money that we saved by not paying for college to help her get started.  My wife and I both don’t want to do that and encouraged her to go to college, take some theater classes and get a degree so if it doesn’t work out she has something to fall back on.  My daughter thinks it’s unfair that we spent so much on our other children’s futures, but won’t help her out.  We would of course support her in her dreams to be on broadway, but we wouldn’t be doing it financially.  So are we the assholes here?",False,False
1,"AITA for refusing to forgive my younger brother? |  A little backstory: My brother and I were always extremely close up until 3 years ago. When he was 12 and I was 20 my mom and I had a falling out over honoring my Grandma’s final wishes to have her small fortune donated to various charities(my mother felt she should have been able to keep most of it). Later that week my brother took me off Facebook, Snapchat, and our shared video games. I tried texting him to ask what was wrong and he said after the argument he didn’t want to see me anymore. 

I was upset but I gave him space thinking I’d talk to him and explain he doesn’t need to choose sides but he never responded back to any messages. Now it’s 3 years later and he wants to apologize and talk it out, I refused and told him he had a chance 3 years ago and that 12 years old imo is an age where your actions can lead to very real consequences. I told him he survived 3 years without me he will survive more.

I get that I may be going overboard on this but he made the decision (stepdad confirmed mom had no part) and I don’t feel he is entitled to forgiveness.

I apologize if there isn’t enough information this is all there is to it. I didn’t get any form of explanation from him and my mom trimmed my branch off the family tree. ",False,False
1,"AITA for having a ""No Exes In Our Home"" policy? | This is from a relationship that has long passed, we broke up for different reasons but this definitely added to it. Anyway...

My GF at the time and I decided to live together, she moved in with me. She was still good friends with one of her exes. I was fine with this but expressed that I wasn't interested in befriending him or being around him. Before she moved in, one of my rules was that her ex was not allowed in our home. This rule applies to me as well, but I am not friends with any of my exes because I don't see the point. 

This rule didn't sit well with her because she felt like she had the right to have any guest over as it was also her home. My response to that was that under no circumstances should I feel uncomfortable in our home. If a person's presence makes me feel this way, then they are unwelcome. Her ex's lack of presence in our home doesn't make her uncomfortable, therefore my preference overrules hers. 

We argued more about it until I brought up that only my name was on the lease. She accepted my policy, but it was truly the beginning of the end of our relationship. Was I the asshole?",False,False

1,"WIBTA if I complained about my restaurant experience | Last night was a goodbye party for a friend (she was moving out of state). I was excited to only have my two youngest with me and getting a little bit of a ""break"". As the server is delivering the food (and all the chaos that comes with that) my 3 year old decided to stand up and touch one of the recessed lights burning his hand. I tried everything to calm him down ice water, even went out to the car and got some burn cream from my first aid kit, which was brand new and had to bring it in to use the restaurant's scissors to cut the package open.

Not once did any of the staff ask he was ok or what happened. When i explained to the front desk lady what happened she just gave a sympathetic nod and then scurried away. He was crying so hard I had to ask for to go boxes and the bill. They didn't even offer to help me box it up. Thankfully one if my friends was able to coax the wailing, drooling, snotty kiddo out of my arms so I could box everything up.

Now I'm not looking for a free meal, I should have been paying more attention to him and realized he was standing in his seat, but the lack of concern frustrated me. Especially since the bill came out to $41 for two kids meals and my food, and I lost out on a good bye dinner for a friend along with being stared at by every patron in the restaurant.

0,"AITA for telling my brother-in-law to give his kids a bath? | My brother-in-law (BIL) and sister-in-law (SIL) have two kids... 6F and 2M.

SIL is super woman and does everything around the house and for her kids. Literally, everything. During the entirety of their kids lives, BIL has literally only changed one diaper for his daughter (6F) right after she was born and the nurses were showing him how to do it while SIL was sleeping. 

Anyway...

SIL recently had a pretty major surgery. She’s mobile, but is really struggling, and hasn’t been feeling well due to the medications she is on. Part of their kid’s Sunday night routine includes FaceTiming their grandparents and then my husband and me to say hi.

While on FaceTime with the kids and SIL, we hear BIL say, “SIL! You need to get the kids in the bath!” She says to him, “can you do it tonight? I’m not sure how much longer I can stay awake. I’m feeling awful.” And he says, “you know I can’t.” Then, he walks out of the room. 

I ask SIL why he “can’t.” She tells us that he feels it’s inappropriate for him, an adult male, to see the genitalia of children... INCLUDING HIS OWN CHILDREN. Nonetheless, apparently it’s fine for his wife? These kids are 6 and 2. It’s not like he’s bathing a teenager.

My husband and I tell her that we feel this is ridiculous and she says it just is what it is at this point and she’s given up on asking him for help with baths and diaper changes. A few minutes later, BIL comes back and says, “SIL, why aren’t they in the bath yet?”

At this point, I’m annoyed. I’ve been annoyed by his lack of help with the kids for years now... but I don’t know. This kind of set me off. 

I say (nicely, but maybe not as nicely as I feel it was), “BIL, why don’t you get the kids in the bath? I’m sure SIL would appreciate it as she still isn’t feeling well and wants to go to bed.” He tells me to back off and that they “have a system“ and I have no right in telling him how to parent his kids. 

SIL tells us she has to go and hangs up. 

My husband isn’t upset by what I said as he’s felt very similar over the years. However, about 30 minutes later, my husband gets a call from his mom saying that while she completely agrees with me, I am essentially being the AH for butting into their marriage. (I’m assuming SIL told her what happened when they FaceTimed her parents after us.)

Maybe I shouldn’t have said anything, but I felt I needed to stand up for SIL after years of dealing with having to do EVERYTHING, including when she’s sick/recovering from surgery.

I am a profesional gamer and that's where most of my household's income comes from and there was a tournament happening on a certain day which i had been training for months. My wife knew how important this was not only for me to boost my standing and fame but also for us to increase our income. My wife is pregnant and is expected to deliver around 3 weeks after the the video game tournament.She told me to go and everything will be fine because the delivery isn't expected and worst case scenario she'll be fine if it happens.

Next day I'm about to start semifinals, this is a big deal, if i win semifinals and make to the finals i will make tens of thousands of dollars and have the opportunity to win many times more that in the finals my wife calls me 20 minutes before the semifinals start saying she's about to go into labor and needs me to come down. I told her i can't and she loses her shit cursing at me nonstop. I have to leave and i hang up on here.

0,"AITA for telling my friend that her movie idea already exists. | My friends think I should have left it for her to figure out and I should have stayed out of it but I think the opposite and didn’t want her to get her dreams crushed by a big time label, as she was planning on taking it to a movie producer.

Basically my friend has had this dream since high school to make a movie, she had been working on this scrip for years and refused to let anyone read it just incase someone was to try and steel it or something.

Finally a few days ago she invited me over to read the synopsis and the first page of the scrip so I could give my thoughts, I was kinda against it as friends shouldn’t really do this but she persisted and I agreed.

After reading the synopsis I realised that it was 100% just a slightly different version of a film that was already out, I was unsure if I should say something at first but the look on my face must have made her think something was wrong as she asked me if I liked it and if she had done something wrong in the scrip. I said I did like it but told her that it’s already a movie, she was crushed.

She actually realised after I mentioned it that it was already a film and had a OHHHHHHH moment.

As an example without giving away the actual movie, imagine Harry Potter with a female lead and a slightly different plot.  That’s how close her plot was to the actual film.

0,"AITA for wanting to talk to a lawyer about some financial issues my wife brought into our marriage? | My wife was married briefly to a guy for about 9 months about 4 years ago. He turned out to be a criminal and a drug addict (all of which he hid from her) and committed three felonies (some big time thefts) and got thrown in prison right before she filed for divorce. He is currently serving an 18 year sentence with chance of parole.  He also has a very lengthy criminal record spanning decades.

I live in a community property state and just recently learned any debt obtained while married is 50/50 split upon divorce even if the debt is in only one of the spouse's name.  Everything was in his name when they were married and he ran up all their credit cards, etc and didn't tell her anything.  He also has to pay substantial restitution for what he did.

I feel it is possible upon his release, he may instigate some legal action against my wife because she divorced him and cut all contact with him shortly after he got thrown in prison.  I fear if he does this, it is possible any judgements against her will also become my responsibility since we are married now but I'm no lawyer.

My wife didn't bring anything into the marriage but I have substantial holdings, a home, etc. that I do not want this felon coming after so I told my wife I think it wise to speak to a lawyer and see what could this felon possibly do to us financially upon his being paroled and what we can do to protect our now shared assets.  

I have no idea what kind of debt this felon racked up during their short marriage but I do not want any part of it.  I have already had to deal with some other things regarding this asshole and I'm not going to let him touch what I have worked my whole life to build up.  Legally, I think it is at least possible, though unlikely, he may have some sort of case against my wife for money and any judgement against her could negatively affect me and my two boys (as well as her two kids).

My wife is upset that I brought this up and thinks I'm overreacting but I do not want to bet everything I have worked for on what I or she thinks this felon may or may not have the legal right to do.  Neither of us are lawyers and I don't want to just sit around and wait for things to happen to us, I want to be prepared for possibilities.

Right before my aunt died, the whole family had gathered for a graduation party for my cousin. (this included my mom, who was invited by my cousin despite my other auntie not wanting it to happen.) 

Basically, my mom asked my dads youngest sister if she could come to the funeral or if it would cause issues and the youngest sister said, ""It would cause too much issues, honestly, you shouldn't come."" My dad said something similar. My mom searched through all her old pictures for pictures of my late aunt and gave them to my dad to have.

I'm pretty sure that's super against Amazon's seller policies to do that. 

But I decided to email them and say I left my review and wanted my gift (I didn't leave a review and still haven't). They responded positively, and then today I got the gift, which was a second one of the same exact item.

1,"AITA for wanting to switch seats with someone at a wedding and then getting mad when they refused? | Some of mine and my partner’s close friends got married and at their wedding reception they had square tables that seated 2 people on each side of the table, totalling 8 people per table. While everyone was taking their seats I noticed that all of our friends who were couples were seated on the same side of the table at their tables. But our table looked different. My partner and I were seated around a corner and there was a single friend of ours, let’s call him G, seated next to me on the same side of the table. Directly opposite me was a another couple who were seated on the same side of the table. So I thought it was weird that my partner and I were the only couple in the room not seated on the same side of the table and that it was possibly a mistake. I also noticed that the wedding photographer was making his way around photographing guests in candid shots and that the candid shots were of couples sitting on the same sides. I then asked G if he wouldn’t mind swapping with my partner so that the photographer wouldn’t assume that we were a couple and take all the shots of us together. I wanted to be in all their wedding photos together with my partner, looking all nice for a wedding. He flat out refused. When I asked him why, he said he wanted to stay seated next to the other single guy at our table (another close friend, let’s call him A). I tried to persuade him by saying that he could sit next to my partner and that also we wouldn’t be seated this way all night, we’ll be dancing and mingling later and it would just be for the photos at the beginning. At this point my partner had stepped in and also asked to swap. A was taking G’s side saying he also didn’t want him to swap. At this point we were having a hushed argument around the table until eventually I gave in and just accepted that he wouldn’t swap.

My husband wasn't happy with this but I put my foot down and said I wasn't working or discussing it until after the baby was born.

It was a difficult pregnancy and the warnings my mum gave me weren't really enough, nearer my due date I was constantly sore and had difficulty sleeping. My husband was never there for me and was always at work so I relied on my sister and mum to help me out. He'd get home late form work each day and would spend all his time on the sofa or at the gym. My tossing and turning in bed trying to find a comfortable position annoyed him to the point that he started sleeping in the second bedroom.

To cut a long story short I feel like I've gone through this pregnancy alone and he hasn't helped me at all or been there for me. Even when i went into labour he was at work and said he'd meet me at the hospital, I had to get my sister to drive me to the hospital.

I was so annoyed and angry at him that I just didn't want him in there stressing me out. I asked the hospital staff to not let him in and I only wanted my mum there with me. She supported me throughout and I had a beautiful baby girl and I let him in as soon as I'd been cleaned up.

I do like playing D&D but a huge plus to all of this is that she gets to spend time with them often. 

The problem is the house. It has become increasingly filthy over the past few months. Partly due to the baby husky that they bought to add to their pack of 4 dogs. That dog (with the help of the others) has destroyed that house. They do not bathe the dogs at all and they are free to come into and out of the house as they please by way of doggie door. Which adds to the literal layer of dust on all hard surfaces in the house. 

Whenever the dogs would make a mess (pee or poop) in the house, they would just apply the big daddy fix. They would just pull out a puppy pad and place it over the piss/poop AND THEN LEAVE IT THERE! 

I swear to you that for two consecutive weekends we went over there and I saw the same disgusting puppy pads covering up the same mess from the weekend prior. 

The house is gross for that reason but also because they don’t clean. They don’t sweep or mop the floors. They don’t disinfect anything,, They don’t wipe down the counters, they don’t scrub the toilets or clean the sinks. The list goes on. You name the cleaning activity and they don’t do it.

Besides the fact that I think they are living in a literal health hazard, I am allergic to dogs. So I’ve been toughing it out but can’t take it anymore. I’m not right for days after going there.

I’ve brought it up to my wife and it turned into a huge fight. She thinks I am an absolute asshole for wanting to say something to them about it. She tells me that I have no right in telling people how to live in their own home. She feels the exact same way that I do about the house being disgusting but she thinks it’s the absolute rudest thing I could possible do. She would rather I just say that I can’t play there because of the dogs. Which is half the truth. 

I could always just pop and allergy pill and tough it out. But the combination of the HEAVY pee smell and layers of filth on anything really bums me out.

I on the other hand think it’s an intervention level crisis. I feel like it is our duty as family members to bring it to the attention of people that just don’t see it as a problem.

This whole thing just blows my mind. I literally can’t understand why I would be the asshole in this situation for wanting to tell them (at the very least) why I can’t attend anymore if they insist on hosting there without doing basic cleaning. 

I don’t understand how telling family something like this is rude. 

Please give me your opinions on the matter. I really want to understand this. My wife is probably thinking about ways to make my life tough while she’s decompressing in the bath tub right now.",False,False
1,"WIBTA for not returning a phone accidentally sent to me | This has been bothering me for a couple weeks now and I will try and keep this as short as possible. FYI I'm on mobile so sorry it the formatting is weird. So about a month ago I went into a well known tech store to upgrade my phone to a galaxy S20. I wanted the color of the phone to come in black, but at the time I didn't know that type of phone did not come in that color. The person who I was dealing with apparently did not know either, and he ordered the wrong phone (S20 ultra) because he saw it came in black. Now this phone he ordered was about 400 dollars more than the one I wanted, so when he rang me up, the total was obviously wrong. He realized the mistake, got a manager over, and rang me up for the phone I wanted. 

Now here is the part where I don't know if I am the asshole or not. My phone came to my house, as planned. However, the other phone that was 400 dollars more ALSO came to my house about a week later. When I left the store originally the guy told me that they had canceled that original order. So I checked my balance and I was still only charged for the phone I wanted. AITA if I also keep the phone sent to me on accident? I was going to return it but everyone is telling me to keep it because ""it was their mistake"" and ""they are a big company, they won't miss it"".

0,"AITA for asking for my dead mom's jewelry?? | ok... so I've been thinking about this for a really long time. My mom died when i was super young (4 years old) and i do have memories of her. When i would come to visit her at my grandparents house, i slept in her room. I'd often look at her jewelry box/ chest and what was in it. After my mom and grandmother died in that house, my grampy just left the house abandoned. He then thought he was dying of cancer, but he survived. During the time of when he thought he was gonna die, he gave the house to my uncle. So my uncle moves in w/ his family (wife and 3 kids). They renovated the house and everything. I asked him about my mom's belongings and some stuff that i had in that house. He just said ""it all had to be thrown away."" I was very hurt by that, but understood that that was probably the case. However, i went into the basement there and found all kinds of furniture and pictures there (I'm very into history and genealogy, considering the fact that i hardly know that side of my family). I ask him if i can look at that stuff he says yeah sure. A few years later, i go into my cousin's room (my mom's room, where she died.) and i see the familiar jewelry box/ chest from my childhood... that i know is my mom's. I then become very overwhelmed with sadness and anger... i didn't show it, but i was severely hurt. Also, a year or 2 later my other cousin, said yeah these were all your mom's stuff. Again, I'm very hurt and talk to my dad about it. My dad seems to think that i should allow these 2 girs, who never met my mom (their aunt), to just keep all of my mom's belongings. I'M BEYOND FILLED WITH ANGER. I ask my uncle, but then he turns it around to me, saying ""you have my mom's jewelry chest that I've been looking for."" My grampy gave me my grandmother's jewelry chest for a birthday, with no jewelry in it because he gave it all to his new wife. Am i wrong for having my grandmother's jewelry chest?? I'm genuinely confused and was considering giving it to him. But he'd just give it to one of his daughters. 
So... am i wrong for asking for my dead mother's jewelry chest?? Everyone has been treating me like im an asshole for asking for my moms things. If my cousin has it, i still want it because she doesn't understand the significance that it's had to me PLUS SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW MY MOM.

0,"AITA for not picking up my upstairs neighbor's friend at 3am? | Obligatory ""on mobile"".

So for some background: my upstairs neighbor and I go way back to high school, and were housemates at one point as well. I consider him to be my friend. He drinks and sometimes overdoes it, and there are times when there's no talking to him when he's like this. During these times he's been known to want to be social or ask favors at what I consider to be inappropriate hours/circumstances. Over the years I've come to accept this is just one of his ""things"" and it usually doesn't lead to anything major. The drinking is relevant because I suspect it might have been a factor in this situation.

As for me, I get up for work very early in the morning (3am, start work at 5am). I'm a fairly crucial opener, so unless I'm too sick to work I really need to be there. 

I was getting ready for work the other morning and there was a knock on the door. My boyfriend answered and it was my upstairs neighbor asking if we could go pick up his friend who was stranded downtown. My boyfriend said no, as his license is currently not valid and even if it was, I'm the only one with a car and I was heading into work soon. 

So I'm walking out to my car and he's outside. I don't know if he was specifically waiting for me, but he asked me again and I told him I really had to be at work and couldn't do it. I asked about calling an Uber for the stranded friend, and he told me ""she's lost"". So not only would we be going downtown to pick up this person, we'd have to actually locate her as well. :/

I ended up going in to work, but I still feel kinda bad for it. I don't think it was at all unreasonable of me to decline, but I keep thinking ""what if she was in trouble?"" or ""what if something were to happen to her and I could have prevented it?"".

I'm honestly not sure why an Uber wouldn't have been an option unless they didn't have money for one, but I would have been fine helping them out with it if that was the case. I was kind of in a hurry, so I didn't stick around to find out. I haven't talked to him since and I hope he isn't upset with me and that his friend is okay. AITA?",False,False

She was definitely very attractive, and I wanted to approach her, but it was a higher-end restaurant and she was with a group of her friends.

Before we left (her group had started eating later than us) I saw her on her iPhone and sent her a note with my phone number over airdrop. Luckily, no one else was using their phones.

I saw her look down, then smile, and I felt very pleased with myself. I told my (F) friend what happened after we left and she got kind of angry with me. She said I was being a creepy douchebag.

I thought it was respectful, since I didn’t put any pressure on her and she could decide whether or not to text me of her own free will. I do want to know if this is douchey, though, so I’ll know not to do it again.

1,"AITA for not reading my wifes novel? | So a few years ago for my wifes birthday I surprised her by getting the novel she wrote published. Got her hard copies for family and friends and loaded her new kindle with the book so when she opened it she saw her book on it.

 She asked me to read it but I dont read, it was my punishment growing up (read a book a day while grounded) and I just associate reading books with being punished. I'm not illiterate I just dont read for fun I read articles that interest me. She has been bringing up for years but now its getting to a point where she brings it up whenever we fight. I did something wrong and somehow the fight leads to ""...and you still haven't read my book!"" 

I feel like I did my part for her book and reading it would just cause her to be even more mad at me. The genre isnt my cup of tea if I even wanted to read, think teen girl novel similar to twilight (just the target audience not the story).

1,"AITA for avoiding a coworker who said they became friends with me because I seemed lost? | Hey! Sorry for bad formatting, I’m on mobile. 

I (31 f) moved across country with my boyfriend about a year ago and transferred from the department store I was working at to one over here. My job is to provide customer service, set up orders, and it’s a very chill job where you stand around and approach people as they come through.  

When i started this job initially on east coast, everyone was friendly, helpful and people who didn’t know me made a point to include me. Over here it’s different, I’ve been open and friendly but it was hard to make friends here. After a month or two, I started to think maybe they didn’t want to talk and this was a job and to focus on that, while still being friendly if people wanted to talk. 

Today a coworker(55m) whose moving to another department told me he initially became friends with me because I looked lost and he wanted to make be the person who would actually talk to me. I know, I know... it might sound sweet like he was trying to be friendly and saying he was reaching out to me... but I read it as him saying he became friends with me because he felt bad for me. I do talk to a lot of coworkers now and have made friends in a new department. 

after he said that, I kind of avoided him the rest of the day because I don’t want to be a pity friend. I told another coworker and he agreed with me but I also feel like TA because he was trying to reach out and maybe felt like i needed it.

1,"AITA for charging my friends more than I’m paying? | Obviously at first glance this sounds bad, which is why I made this post.

Compared to my friend group, I’m a big golfer. None of them had really ever had interest in it in the past other than me. I still rarely ever played but if anyone within the group was considered the golf guy it was likely me.

Recently I’ve had a few different friends ask me to go to the driving range with them, after a few visits I saw a membership discount card where you pay an upfront fee and get cheaper balls, after about 20ish visits it pays for itself and you’re getting cheaper balls. It was a gamble since I didn’t know how much I’d really go but I bought it.

After I bought it, I buy a bucket of balls for $10 ($14 without discount) to split with them. When asking for payment I charge them $7, and I “charge myself” $7 as well. This way we each contributed $2 to the cost of the card. This is how I planned on paying for the card when I originally purchased it, although I did not tell anyone. If I go alone, I charge myself $4 for the bucket to go towards the cost of the card. My plan is that after 20 visits, I’ll have $100 from overcharging and the card will be “free” for everyone to enjoy, meaning that once its paid off I’ll only charge the $10 price to split. 

Now some of my friends have said that it’s not fair that I’m basically expecting them to pay for my card. I see where they’re coming from, but they’re paying the same price they would have had I never gotten the card, and once it’s paid off they’ll be able to enjoy it with me for free. Given that I have to be there to use the card I’m already contributing the most, and I also go alone sometimes too.

Ultimately I see where they’re coming from, but I feel like what I’m doing is better for everyone. I know it was my decision and I didn’t consult anyone but I feel like since it didn’t change anything for anyone upfront, and eventually we all get cheaper balls that it’s better for everyone.

His grandma (my husband's mom) was visiting around that time about two weeks ago, and I was taking my son to go use the bathroom. She then decided to tell my him ""Be careful, a monster might pop out of the toilet!"" My son then started crying, and he refused to use his potty and wet his pants instead. My husband and I asked Grandma what the hell she was thinking, and she only got defensive and insisted that it was just a joke. She refused to apologize. So we kicked her out of the house.

My son has been refusing to use his potty since then for the past two weeks, and we had to put him back into diapers for the time being.

1,"WIBTA for not going to son's wedding?? | 

Here's a little backstory. My 29 y/o stepson (SS) was released from prison this fall after serving 12 years. His mom left him and DH when he was a baby and DH raised him. When SS was 14, he decided he wanted to be with his mom and took off for the East coast. Mom was a dopehead, which DH or SS didn't know, and she had SS commit a robbery to feed her dope habit.  SS was caught and given adult straight time. Mom walked and basically ignored SS after that. We live in the Midwest backwoods and SS was raised here.  SS is and was a good kid.  His mother's manipulation landed him where he was. This is important.

A few months before SS was released he met a gal (B) who worked at the facility and they became ""friendly"".  As a result, she was fired and he got transferred.  All of this happened about 6 weeks before SS's release date.  He was supposed to come home, here, until he met B.  When SS was released, he moved in with B and now they're engaged to be matried in June 2019.

 B comes from money, definitely upper upper middle class at least.  SS is was raised in the backwoods until age 14 and spent the next 12 years in prison.  Polar opposites but they make it work. I'm happy for him, really, but neither DH or I care much for B.  She's too uppity.

SS has put me in the position of getting to DH to their wedding.  DH is really butt hurt over SS's decision to stay with B and wants nothing to do with her.  I've told DH he needs to suck it up and be there for his son.  I can convince DH to go but I'm having second thoughts now.

B and her people are way out of our league. We would stand out like a shit stain on a white sheet and from what we've seen from B so far, it would be pointed out to us. DH is a complete backwoods redneck with no filter. I just don't see this turning out good so WIBTA for not going to the wedding?

I’m all about different strokes for different folks and trying not to judge people based upon their hobbies and interests and personal choices in how they live their lives, but people who are really into horror films creep me the fuck out.  

My spouse and I get to know a couple through a shared sport’s team and the four of us end up hanging out a few times. Nice people, easy to hang out with, we do a couple of dinners and board game nights and they’re place is always a nice night out.  One night we’re over at their place and they ask if we feel like watching a movie, and they show us their collection of DVDs. It’s mostly horror, and a lot of hardcore looking horror at that. I say I’m not into horror and they launch into how much they love it and it’s fun and an escape to watch. They push me to watch one and I politely say “Hey whatever floats your boat”, but I am strongly adverse to horror and I don’t want to make a big deal about it, but no chance I’m watching horror.  We pick something neutral and finish out the night, no big deal.

My spouse and I get home and I tell her I’m not interested in hanging out with them anymore. She knows I’ve got a thing about hanging out with people who are into horror and understands it’s a hard no-go with me but she’s annoyed because good couple friends are hard to find and she doesn’t want to throw away the friendship over their taste in movies.

Anyway, we blow them off a few times and because we see each other through our sports team often it eventually becomes obvious there’s a thing. Eventually the husband pulls me aside and asks “is something the matter, I just want to know if we did something wrong or something?”

Now it’s awkward and I decide to just tell the truth thinking it’s the adult thing to do and level with them. I say “Listen, I didn’t want to make a thing out of it, I just really have a thing with people who are into horror movies and when I saw your collection and you guys talked about it, it’s just something that weirds me out. It’s my personal thing, you guys are great, but I just don’t really hang out with people who are really into horror because I really really don’t like it.”

Long story short, they get super offended and tell me I’m being ridiculous and am a shitty person for ghosting them because of what movies they like. It becomes a thing on our team and now my spouse is bitter at me for blowing the situation up by being unnecessarily direct about it.  I sort of don’t care what people that are into watching torture think about me, but I’m wondering if it was offsides on my part to tell them the real reason or if this thing is my personal problem and I should have just shut my mouth and made up a polite excuse?

This is the kind of tiny shop were we see the same people every day. Sometimes I see our regulars 4+ times at day because they don't want to go outside to grab a coffee/snack. I have worked at this shop for 3 years and have gained some real friendships with out regular customers. Most of our regulars don't have to order because we already know what they get and often we see them and chat about their lives while making their drinks. 

There is one woman who always treats our staff like shit. I see her maybe once a month and she ALWAYS ends up screaming at whoever is working because they don't have her drink memorized. The problem is she always comes in with a friend and then when we explain we don't know what she wants she claims we are ""humiliating"" her in front of them because ""she is a regular and should be treated as such!"" However it's always her friend/guest who pays.

Before christmas she bought like 10 coffees for her office and then 2 hours later came back screaming that the coffees were all garbage and we have embarrassed her with her coworkers and that we need to give her the money back. My manager at a total loss gave in a she got her money back. The next day she bought the SAME 10 coffees and 2 hours later put on the exact same show and got her money back AGAIN. The third day she came back demanding her money my manager told her she wasn't getting anything and she flipped. She spent so long holding up the line and telling everyone that walked in that we were ""robbing her"" that my manager gave her the money.

I have not seen her since that week (so roughly a month as usual) and she came in last night while I was closing up alone. She brought a friend in with her and came up demanding ""her regular"" and when I told her I didn't know what that was she launched into her usual screaming fit. She said she ""always comes here"" and ""spends so much money we should be treating her better"". Her friend paid (like they always do) and she continued to talk shit while I made their drinks.

After the christmas drink issue I couldn't take it and snapped. I turned on her and said straight to her face. ""Well how can I remember what you drink, you only ever come when someone else is paying."" She turned bright red but immediately shut up. The funniest part to me was that her friend didn't at all seem offended by my comment and instead just looked at her and when she said nothing they both just took their coffees and left.

1,"AITAH for inserting myself into random strangers conversations? | Context: I'm talking about when two people--or one person and a pair of airpods--get into a confined or quiet space (elevators, airplane, etc.) with other people and start or continue a LOUD dialogue between themselves.

I just have a pet peeve about rude, selfish narcissists who think they're so fucking interesting that everyone around is *dying* to hear how ""omg, did y'all hear what A said bout B behind C's back?!"" or whatever the conversation is about. 

So lately I've just been innocently chiming into these conversation as if I think they're talking to me directly. It's actually pretty amusing when I inject my two cents into the middle of a conversation. Usually I just get like ""WTF is this creep doing"" looks and then they shut up, but I have been called an asshole for butting into a private conversation, to which I usually just smile and say something like ""oh, you weren't shouting so we all could hear?""

0,"WIBTA If I tell to my cousin's wife that I'm not interested in her religion? | Well, for starters, I live in a very religious country, my entire family is religious and I respect that. I wouldn't refer to myself as an atheist, probably agnostic since there are still a lot of questions with no scientific answers, but just hypothesis. Still, I respect other people's beliefs, I just don't fully share them. My favourite religion is being a nice person. 

Anyways, the thing with my cousin's wife is that she's a fanatic (her fanatism is so blind, she does not go to a hospital for treatment to her skin cancer, but instead just prays until she heals magically) that would constantly try to push her beliefs into other people, doesn't let other people talk and trusts whatever a book or a priest says. My cousin is nothing like her though, he just lets her be because he does not want any problem.

The thing is, I go there quite a lot because my cousin is a really good mechanic so he helps us a lot with the maintenance of our cars and trucks. So, last time I went, waiting for my cousin to finish, she bombarded me with a lot of religious stuff I really didn't care about to the point I got really tired of her being totally abnoxious and had to excuse myself to the bathroom until the job was done. 

I have to go next week, so if it happens again, WIBTA if I just simply tell her ""I don't care?""

Only during the holidays will he sometimes get home little bit later. I understand that he has a job with long hours, he is a mail carrier but he rarely has to walk his route anymore. I am not saying I understand the position is in, but I am saying it is possible for him to cook for her.

She works also and when she isn't working she is getting stuff around the house done and doing things for my Dad as well, that he may not be able to get done, such as getting groceries or picking clothes up for him at the store. He comes home and generally goes down to his office and plays on the computer for a while.

My Mom(51) always cooks him food, he never makes his own except if he realizes no one will be making dinner for him and he has to cook instant food or something easy. He will linger around and be like ""are you guys eating"" bc he sees that no one has made food and no one will be making any because we all are tired.

He also will get hungry from seeing something my Mom had made of hers and will be like ""I should have you make me one"" like he is too lazy to even make something as simple as an English muffin pizza. I would get it if she only did this sometimes, but he always has her make his food. Even if its just heating chicken nuggets in the oven.

I approached him the other day and told him it might be nice if he makes my Mom dinner every once in a while just because I feel that he has enough time to do it, even though he works. He got irritated (like usual) and ignore me and laughed in my face because I guess I asked too much of him.

My mom has been trying to get me to either take some community college classes or get a job. I’ve been avoiding both of those things. She has offered to pay for college, but I know it would just be a waste of money. I can’t mentally handle school or work.

She’s never taken my mental health seriously. In fact, she almost refuses to acknowledge it. I have aspergers, and most likely depression, and she’s never had any interest in dealing with it beyond sending me to a therapist once a year to get prescribed meds.  I spent two straight days in bed, only leaving to get food in the mornings, and once I finally pulled myself out of that cycle she immediately reminded me that I needed to get a job.

0,"AITA for shouting at my brother after he repeatedly interrupted my night with my husband | So when all the colleges shut down my 19 year old brother asked if he could stay with us rather than our parents, which I thought was kind of sweet that he trusts me that much but quickly became very tiresome once he moved in.

We live in a one story house, and it’s pretty small, so you can hear anything going on in the living room and kitchen from the master bedroom. The spare bedroom is used as my office, and my brother is staying in the basement. But he has some strange habits. At night he likes to make smoothies, like at 10 at night he’s using a blender. And he doesn’t go to sleep until 2 in the morning and he runs the TV at full volume all night.

My husband has been really stressed the past couple weeks and I could tell needed a relaxing, quiet night. I planned on making a warm bath then giving him a massage afterwards, and then we could just relax. I asked my brother beforehand if he could be quiet in the kitchen and keep the TV volume down for yesterday night. 

Well when my husband went to the bathroom for the bath, my brother knocks on the door and asks if he could borrow shampoo because he ran out. So I go into the bathroom and get him shampoo. Then 10 minutes later he comes back asking if we have an extra towel because he could only find one. I get him the towel and tell him to stop bothering us.

When my husband got out and I started giving him a massage, my brother started running the blender despite me asking him to be quiet. It really ruined the mood and it always sounds awful. He then turned on the tv to full volume. Then 5 minutes later he knocks again and asks if we have any strawberries.

I got pissed off and yelled at him that he’s an adult and can look for the fucking strawberries himself, and that I asked him to be quiet and he ran the blender and knocked on the door a hundred times.

He just said “someone’s angry tonight” in a sarcastic voice then went into the basement. I haven’t talked to him at all today and I don’t think he’s left the basement. My husband thinks I was overly aggressive and while he was annoying he wasn’t intentionally malicious and I should apologize for yelling. I don’t think I should.

0,"AITA for not skating together with my daughter and my ex at my daughter’s birthday party? | Little backstory: my wife and I got addicted to meth and got involved with dcfs. They took our 3 children (7f,5f and 3m) and placed them with my mom. Shortly after this my wife and I split up and she moved in with another guy. He was an old friend of mine so my kids know him but can’t see him because of our situation. 
My middle daughter still won’t accept this and thinks once we get through this my ex and I will get back together. It’s like she thinks the judge is not letting us be together. So I’m having almost daily talks with my daughter trying to get her to understand that her mom and I will not get back together and her mom has a new boyfriend(fiancé)
Back in October my middle daughter had her 5th birthday at a skate rink. My mom invited my ex as well which I have no problem with. We can be civil especially for a birthday party. 
Anyways, my daughter asks me if I will skate with her and then also grabs her moms hand. She then starts smiling and saying “we’re a family again” I then pull away and tell my daughter to go ahead and skate with mommy for a while and we can switch off. I was not comfortable with this. 
My ex brought this up today and was saying I don’t know how to coparent and I should have no problem skating together with our daughter. 
In my opinion it’s only making my daughter think that one day we will be a family again. I feel like she will only take it worse if we keep up the charades.

1,"AITA for finding my husband's parents? | My husband was adopted from a foreign country. His adopted father died when he was young and both of my parents are deceased so our family is very small. DH has never wanted to know his birth parents. His adopted mom has always kind of talked down about them whenever the topic is brought up, and talks about adopting like she should receive an award for bringing him here. I was also adopted and nobody ever talked about our parents to us that way, even though my parents lost me over drugs and alcohol. Eventually I did track down both my birth parents though. Now deceased.

A few months ago we had a scare with an auto-immune reaction and became concerned for our kids. The doctors asked about generic history. I later tell DH that he could know if he called the agency and started the process. He doesn't want to because they gave him up. The area was in a bad way and I try explaining that he doesn't know the exact reasons why and reiterated what the doctors said about genetic history. I said we won't be around forever and both of our families are shrinking, isn't it great there are more people out there maybe wanting to know us and our kids will have a big family again. He says if they gave him up they aren't anyone he wants his kids around.

A few weeks ago I found his parents. For medical history and for them. They weren't allowed to have another child and knew adoption would at least be a chance for him instead of abortion. I didn't tell him. They understand why he's mad but they're grateful he's safe.

Then one night he was going through our photos on the cloud and saw a picture of one of his relatives.

""Who's this?""
""Oh, I think he kind of looks like you, don't you think?""
Bitterly(I think he was jealous actually)""that guy doesn't look anything like me""

Later I asked again if he would ever consider meeting his birth parents, and he flat out refused. I said I know you're hurt but maybe they're looking for you too. He said that's what they get for giving him away. So I stayed silent.

Then yesterday he started to piece together the bit about the picture. I explained it was for our kids, and for him and for them to have closure about their child. I said as a parent now wouldn't you be heartbroken if anything came between you and your kids that you couldn't prevent. I didn't think it was right for his adopted mom to be dragging his birth parents the way she does. That she did a wonderful job raising him and doesn't need to stand over people in desperate situations to prove it. He left for his adopted mom's and neither of them will speak to me now, which sucks because he has all the money and the bank cards and the car and neither of them will pick up so that I can take care of the kids.

I feel like his birth parents deserved to know that their son is safe, and that they have beautiful grandchildren. They are my children's family. They were already robbed of their family once.

0,"AITA for cutting off my brother | AITA for cutting off my brother?

I cut my brother off and I think I'm justified but other family members think I'm over reacting. 

Background, I had an extremely rough marriage. When I left my ex husband I literally fled the state in the night without telling anyone my destination. I told my work I was leaving but not where I was going. I didn't even get my mail forwarded. I have very carefully cultivated a life that doesn't involve my ex but ultimately he learned what state I lived in when I filed for divorce. I make a point not to give my information to anyone who is in anyway in contact with him. He's the kind of man who lashes out when he wants money for drugs and this whole $1200 stimulus has brought him out of the woodwork messaging anyone he knows trying to get a piece of it.

In comes my brother. My brother and I have only been talking for about a year due to our own relationship issues and have a very tentative relationship. We keep things pretty superficial, memes and stuff, unless discussing his life. He won't discuss mine in any detail because he says it's hard for him. That's fine, honestly it probably is. Just saying cutting him off isn't losing a best friend.

So my brother messages me to say that my ex was trying to get in contact with ""us"" which I took to mean him and I. I asked him not to keep talking to him and he gave me some unsolicited details about Ex's woe begotten life. I then shared why I didn't want him to keep talking to him in detail. That's when he says that the messages didnt come to him but to a ""friend"" of his who passed the messages on to him. Alarm bells go off for me. I keep my distance from anyone who associates with my ex at all so the idea that my brother has some sort of secret mutual with my ex made me sick to my stomach. I obviously can't tell my brother's friends not to talk to my ex so I asked who the friend was so I could preemptively block them on facebook to be sure there were no friends of friends connections that would give my ex any info on me. My brother refuses to give me a name saying the friend is very private and discrete and has asked specifically not to have his name given to me. I told my brother I'm not screwing around with my safety and he can either give me the name or I can be done talking to him and cut the connection off there. I don't want to kill mine and my brother's fledgling relationship but I feel justified in burning any bridge I need to in order to keep my ex from crossing the one that gets to me.

1,"AITA for cutting my sister off because of her decisions as an attorney? | My older sister, Jane, was recently arrested and charged with fraud. We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.

This is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.

I know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's ""guilty of a lot of things.""

Last night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.

Amy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.

Of course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.

me: u dont know how to cook rice on a stove top?

he instantly got defensive saying “i dont know how to cook” & “i dont eat rice that often. i know that i cant cook. why would i need to be able to” so i questioned him to what he meant by that and he said “but why should I know?”

me: ...... to be a functional human? and independent?
BF: im not planning on moving out till after im 25. Thats 9 years. im sorry that i don’t know how to cook rice off the top of my head BUT I DONT COOK
me: you really want to have to rely on ur mum for 25 years?
BF: i dont get whats so hard to understand. i can make food,i just don’t cook. i don’t need to eat sushi everyday
me: making rice isnt really cooking though. rice is a staple food. just... you dont think its babyish to rely on ur parent for so many years?

He said he doesnt rely on her and that he does make his own food but “doesnt eat rice very often” again so i said

“cool if u dont know now, but why wait till ur a full ass adult to learn to make the basics of food?”

he then went on to say that his mum is a chef and loves cooking so she always will just do it and make all his food. Then back AGAIN with the “i dont cook!” and because he doesn’t cook he cant make food off the top of his head. Its boiling water...

Me: i go and find recipes and buy the food to make a meal. you dont ever do that?
BF: no i dont I DONT COOK. how can you not understand that
Me: and thats kinda concerning to me
BF: cooking isnt something i enjoy
 
i asked how long he was going to use that excuse and he said he didnt want to keep talking because i was being rude & “looking down on him”

AITA for thinking/ saying thats not an acceptable mindset to have still at 16? Its more the fact he hasnt tried to learn, doesnt want to and thinks relying on his mum for 25 years is ok that made me pissy. It shocked me to think hes being so lazy to not try take notice of how his food is prepared. boiling water then putting a cup of rice in it isnt rocket science or something you have to “remember how to do”. This attitude let me down so much. Im disappointed that hes so immature for just letting his mum do everything for him. Just because your mother is willing to doesnt mean she should. I will admit maybe I was a little rude but I was honestly very shocked at what i was reading. 

Am I the immature one? Should I have been more understanding? Is not knowing how to boil rice at 16 almost 17, a reasonable thing to be shocked and un-approving of?

1,"WIBTA If I outed my BIL for not having a degree? | Throwaway for reasons. My BIL has always been a bit of a screw-up. The frustrating part is that nothing ever seems to bite him in the ass. For example, he has a DWI conviction from a while back. For whatever reason, the county never reported it to whatever system, so it doesn't appear on any background checks that are done on him. 

He also never got a college degree. Oh, he went for 5 years, but he never actually graduated. Wasted his parents money all that time, with nothing to show for it. He only needed to re-take one class to graduate, but never actually got around to it. The school has a limit of 7 years (I think) to do that, and in those 7 years, he never managed to re-take the class. Now it's too late, and I don't think he has any desire to do it anyway.

He used to never actually tell people he graduated. He'll just say ""I went to University of State."" So he never used to actually say he had a degree from Univ. of State, at least not that I heard. About a year ago, he got a pretty great job. No idea how he got it, although I think he sort of knew someone who knew someone else. It's in a field that is sort of tied to what the company I work for does. I'm in a different city, but everyone in this industry kind of knows everyone else, so we have a lot of professional connections. All companies in this field tend to be smaller. Ours are no different, although the company I work for is a pretty major player.

I went to his company's website, and right there, plain as day, is his picture and bio, including a line that he has a Bachelor's Degree in I-Forget-What from University of State. All of that is complete bullshit, so he obviously lied to them.

WIBTA if I told his employer that he doesn't have a degree? Honestly, I don't really care about degrees, but he's just flat-out lying. And frankly, he doesn't deserve this job. He can also be kind of a jerk. For example, he will be completely professional and pleasant when he has to, but as soon as he turns around, he'll laugh about what dumb asses those people are.

I failed the admission exam and now I’m a student in a Business Information Systems department, which is roughly 1/2 Computer science, 1/2 Economics and other related subjects (Accounting, Maths applied in economy, marketing and so on). This department belongs to a Business Administration Faculty. 

This semester we had our first subject related to programming at all and I noticed that several classmates just can’t keep up with the rest of the class - they have never been in touch with programming and they don’t even know what CS is for. 

This is the reason why professors decided that curriculum should be adapted for them, so now we are doing the same boring things I used to do in highschool (C language), in a very slow pace, so basically I learn nothing at school.

It started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.
I get a call from her around 11am. ""What the fuck is The Almanac?"" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says ""I always thought you remembered this stuff..."" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my ""playbook"" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.

0,"WIBTA If I told my Girlfriend the fact her co workers dislike/hate her is probably her fault and not theirs | So, context is key here so please read before rendering upon me your judgement.

Me and my Girlfriend have been together for almost two years, we moved in together 6 months ago and it has been great, she is probably the sweetest woman alive and I love her dearly but I have seen a different side of her these past 2 weeks or so as she has been working from home.

Now I know she has trouble at work with quite a few co workers, I always went off from what she said about it and how she is as a person and figured it was them being *ssholes for no reason because my girlfriend admitedly tends to avoid conflict and can be a bit...meek I suppose? I have told her to go to her boss about ut a load of times.

Now let me be clear she hates how it is at her work, sometimes she comes home stressed, other times she almost cries and the worst occurance was when she did not get a promotion and the talk around the office was that multiple people had complained about ""Refusing to work under her."" Which caused her to be skipped over.

Now as she has been working from home I pretty much see how she is when working and it is not pretty to say the least, she is like 100% different from her usual self, rude, entitled, mean, short etc all come to mind all in all she is thoroughly unpleasant to be around when she is working, at first I figured she was just stressed by having to work from home, but at this point I realize this is just how she is when working/in a rush/under pressure and given she works a pretty competetive job that is pretty much all the time.

Now if she is anything at her job as she is at home when working I am 100% sure her co workers disliking her us her fault, hell if I did not know her I would dislike her by the way she is when working, she is like a different person.

Now given she has so much stress at her job from her co workers, it might ve a good idea to point this all out to her, but I am not sure whether I would be the *sshole by doing this, after all I have no idea how she us when at the office, just how she us when working at home.",False,False

0,"AITA in relation to my GF's attempt to lose weight? | I've been dating my GF for 3 years. She's upset at her current weight. She's put on about 100lbs since we started dating. I've never mentioned it because she has bipolar disorder, and as I struggle with depression I fully understand how food can take the edge off when you get seriously overwhelmed with depression. But for health reasons and of course other reasons, of course I would like for her to get back to a healthy weight. 

My girlfriend's bipolar disorder has been a challenge for me, as where I would normally be assertive in a relationship on issues - I often have to back down in arguments because she responds poorly to being challenged. I often feel like I'm walking on ice, but I do my best to try understand her and work at helping her and supporting her as best I can. 

She is not happy with her current weight, and constantly remarks about it and has been complaining about it for over a year without doing anything about it. 

 I tell her we can work on it together as a team, and both fix our diet. I feel this is the best way to go about it, rather than telling her that SHE needs to lose weight. I don't want her feeling like I'm initiating it, or that it's a journey she needs to take alone. Or that I'm pushing her to do it. For it to be a healthy journey, it needs to be something she is motivated to do and if I do it with her, then it doesn't feel like it's all on her.

So, last week she decided to work on her diet. She was upset today because she hasn't lost any weight yet. I told her to not worry about the short term results - that it had only been a week, but to focus on months down the line to see changes. She was extremely defeatist and said she'll never lose weight. This kinda irritated me, because it had only been a week since she started. 

I felt like she hadn't fully committed, because she was drinking soft drinks and eating chips which are high in carbs so I brought that up, if she wants to see results quicker - that cutting out the junk food completely (rather than cutting down) will help her. Now I understand she's trying to make a change, but the defeatist attitude after only a week is difficult to work with. 

She then got angry at me and told me to ""stop arguing with me about my weight"". To which I replied that I wasn't, I had never in our entire relationship brought up her weight, and was just discussing her diet and how she was eating and drinking things that will make her progress slower. 

She then told me to drop it and leave it alone, and is now in a huff with me for the past few hours over it. I understand this is the nature of her bipolar disorder, and she will shut down anything she's challenged about something. 

Am I the asshole for challenging her defeatist attitude on her results, when she was taking short-cuts with junk food?",False,False
0,"AITA For refusing to mow an area filled with dog poop on my friend's parent's lawn | I have been best friends , We'll call him ""Ben"" for 15 years and his wife, ""Sarah"" for 10 years. We have done a lot together and are very close. They recently sold their house and are currently staying with Sarah's parents until they find a new one.

 I know her parents fairly well, and on the rare occasion will go over for dinner at their house. Ben and Sarah have two dogs and in the past,  I have watched them/house sat on the weekends when they go out of town. I do this for free, as they are my friends. 

A month ago, Sarah mentions ""Oh, by the way, we need you to watch the dogs at my parent's house the week of July 26th.""  I figure it is just the weekend, but apparently it is Friday-Friday. I tell her I really don't want to do that and that'll be an inconvenience seeing's my work is 40 min away and I have to be up super early. She mentions that she will pay me (half hearted) and I tell her it's not about the money, and that if she can find anybody else, I will do it. 

Fast forward to last Friday, and I get there after work and there is a itemized note for me. Halfway down the list the parents mention ""if you can mow the lawn, we would appreciate it, here's $40 for your troubles"" also, I smoke, (nasty habit) but would never smoke inside someone's house (I figured given history, that would be known, but number 8 is ""thanks for smoking outside"". That comment heavily annoyed me, because it seemed very passive aggressive and not needed. 

Well, I work in a factory 50 hours a week and it gets upwards of 130 degrees. The last thing I want to do is mow a lawn in 90 degree weather when I get home. The only reason I did it, was to be nice. Anyways, they have their dogs on leads, and the whole side of the house is covered in dog poo. I mowed the front, sides and skipped over that section. 

I text Sarah, that I mowed everything but that area, and that Ben could finish it when he got home.  I get the text back ""Please tell him that so it gets done. She paid you and I don't want it to be unfinished when we get home"". That sent me over the edge and I was fuming. I am going out of my way to watch their dogs and she can't be compassionate and realize I don't have to do it? 

Anyways, I kept my cool (for the most part) and responded ""I'll let Ben know. Your mom can keep the $40 though"".  I feel that I did them a huge favor and I was taken for granted. I am still hoping i'm not crazy they realize they were in the  wrong.  So, AITA here?

1,"AITA for saying some harsh stuff to a rude and irresponsible parent? | Hi everyone,

So this happened yesterday when we were having a small family gathering (me and my parents, my aunt, my cousin and my aunt's husband) to celebrate their return from abroad and my cousin's birthday (a week late but birthday is still one of the reasons). We (me and my parents) haven't seen them for ten days so naturally missed them.

Anyway, we went to a restaurant for dinner and next to our table, a single mom, her sister, her two children, their grandmother and a babysitter were sitting. For a while everything was okay but then the children started to literally scream non-stop. We were obviously disturbed but didn't say anything. 

It is a child-friendly restaurant, no problem with that but the restaurant provides some stuff (such as a portable DVD player with animations or drawing book) for kids to play and they didn't request any of them. Plus there were many more families with children and all of them were quiet apart from these two.

This screaming goes on for like half an hour so and my mom and my aunt started to look at the mother for making her to say something and silence the kids.

Instead, the mother said to my aunt something like: ""why are you looking at me, you've raised a kid as well, it is their every right to play and I can't make them stop. If you are disturbed then leave"".

After this my aunt and mom started to reply back and I said to the mom ""you're the cause of the noise and disturbance so you need to leave"".

While I was saying this stuff suddenly my mom got really angry,stood up and screamed to her for getting her manners together because the mom switched to an informal and rude tone rather than a cover-polite one.

Well, normally I am really really shy, I have social anxiety but as I saw my mom like that something just clicked in me. And I decided to say some harsh and offensive stuff. 

\-So I first said that ""these kids grew up to be a catastrophic failure, just make them again"". 

\-She then replied to me ""so you think you are not a failure"". 

\-I later responded that ""I wish there was a parenting license so that we do not need to deal with you and these kids"".

\- She replied that ""well there has to be a licence for human being first so that I do not have to hear those things"".

After that, the argument stopped, the kids were quite and they left soon after.

It may be unimportant but it also turned out that they were regulars to that restaurant and the manager and waitress tried to consolidate them but said nothing to us which I found rude as she is the one started all this and I was about to go and start and argument with the manager as well but my family stopped me.

0,"AITA for telling my landlord to stop going into my room? | Hi all. I live with a live-in landlord who owns the house. There's usually another housemate but she moved out recently. I live here without a contract and pay cash in hand monthly. It's an arrangement that has worked fine for us both so far.

My door locks from the inside but not from the outside. I value my privacy and personal space a lot, so when I moved in I asked the landlord why the door didn't lock. He said it was for ""safety reasons"", and because there is a boiler access point in my room that would occasionally need to be checked by a repairman. I said ok, as long as people aren't coming in and out of my room and I'm notified about any planned repairs, that wouldn't be a problem.

While I was out today I received a package. Usually when one of us receives a package, we leave it on the stand by the front door. Instead of doing that, my landlord took the package, went into my room and left it in there. I found it when I got home.

A few minutes later when I went into the kitchen to cook my dinner, my landlord came home and said ""Did you find the parcel I left in your room?"" I said yes, but didn't say anything else. Then he started complaining about the fact that I'd taken off my duvet cover and mattress topper, and how he doesn't want me to do that because it'll ruin them. I said ""Yeah but I put a blanket down on the mattress while I took those off."" He went on a rant about old tenants not properly taking care of his house and things and told me again to put the covers back on. I'd taken them off to wash them, but I didn't say anything and he retired to the living room.

I got angrier and angrier at the thought that he'd not only gone into my room, he'd also stayed there long enough to look around and realize I'd taken my bed linen off.

I decided to confront him: ""We don't have a written contract but we have a verbal agreement. I pay you monthly for ownership of that room. You infringed on my privacy by entering a room I pay for. Please don't go into my room again, and if you absolutely have to, please give me notice in advance.""

He said ""I didn't go in there to snoop around. I leave my own bedroom door wide open. Past tenants have made a mess of my house and hoarded kitchen utensils in their rooms. I have to check your rooms to make sure that never happens again.""

But I've always kept my room in a good condition, I've never stolen any of his kitchen things, I haven't stained any carpets or broken anything in my room or elsewhere, and have never given him any reason to think I'm damaging his property.

 I(26M) have been wanting to watch Detective Pikachu for the past few weeks. Unfortunately for me, after asking out 4 different groups of friends and my girlfriend (24F let's call her Joy), everyone is a lot more interested in Endgame. With John Wick releasing last week, I'm probably gonna have to wait till Detective Pikachu releases on Netflix because the hype will switch over to John Wick. The following started last weekend and the ""date"" is supposed to be tomorrow (24/05)

After a bit of pestering and getting an adamant no from Joy, I jokingly told her ""Fine, I'll just go on Tinder"" only to get a ""Hah, like that'll work out"". So I downloaded Tinder, where my profile was from 3~4 years ago, changed only the bio to ""I just don't wanna watch Detective Pikachu alone"" and got to swiping semi-seriously till I fell asleep.

For context, (I think) dating apps aren't exactly a thing where I'm from and (I think) I'm only above average in terms of appearance so expectations were low. So imagine my surprise when I wake up to a match (23F let's call her Jenny) asking whether or not I was serious about the movie. I excitedly said yes, asked when she was available and where she lived/worked so we could go to a theatre that wasn't too far away from our places/workplaces depending on the situation.

It didn't occur to me that I should tell Jenny that I'm in a relationship until I told Joy about the match. Throughout the entire time, I thought Joy was ok with it. She joked about how I'll end up watching the movie alone once I told Jenny. I came clean to Jenny ASAP and told her that if she was still interested, I'd pay for the tickets, popcorn, drinks, etc. and the ""date"" was still on. Normally, I wouldn't do this but I admit I was tunnel visioning pretty hard. I probably shouldn't have assumed it from Joy's replies but I also told Jenny that Joy was ok with it since it's just a movie and dinner (might as well right?)

Fast forward to yesterday, we were having dinner and I showed Jenny's Instagram to Joy. This is probably where I might be TA for possibly making Joy insecure by commenting on how gorgeous Jenny is (a sentiment that Joy vocalised first) garnished with an ""I didn't think I could land an 8.5"".

After desserts, I felt like Joy was giving me the cold shoulder. Nothing aside from a goodbye and no ""I just got home"" text from her. Till today, Joy hadn't replied to several of my texts asking her how work was, etc.

I've also asked if she objects to the ""date"" with Jenny just to be sure. No reply still. I'm still planning to watch the movie tomorrow. Joy might have just been too preoccupied/tired to reply. Am I over thinking this or WIBTA if I followed through on the ""date""?",False,False

He and I were taking the same algebra course. Everything was okay until end of semester when I had to present an ordinary exam.

I failed that test so I presented the same test again (you can make the same test twice in case you fail the first one).

Anyway, everything was fine until Timmy, who presented both ordinary exams, went to the teacher (Sofia) and he demanded her his first test. She told him that he needed to wait because giving him his failed test would give him an unfair advantage over everybody else.

Timmy was very rude tu her, started yelling and throwing tantrums because he didn’t receive his past exam. Sofia refused to give him his exam and Timmy failed. All the classroom saw this happen.

Two months later Sofía told us that Timmy (trough his parents) tried to sue her because of that. Obviously that didn’t work out, but all authorities were really scared there was backlash from this so they fired her.

Fast forward 2 weeks ago. The exact same thing happened with another professor. Timmy was about to fail so the authorities fired him to avoid any repercussions with his family.

We couldn’t believe it. It was completely ridiculous but that’s how it all went down.

Me and a bunch of other students that also shared classrooms with him reunited and wrote a letter that demanded the authorities to do better and, at least make some investigation because firing someone that way is illegal in this country.

We send this letter not only to faculty members, but to diverse government organisms so this teachers could, at least, defend their careers.

Every news article in my town are talking about a 14 year old kid that was dropping off college after two and a half semesters because it was too difficult for him. It’s uncertain wether or not Sofía and John (the other fired teacher) are getting their jobs back but everything points out to them teaching again next year.

We’re all very happy to hear that except Timmy’s family hates us but specially me because I started it all.

What do you guys think?

TL;DR brilliant kid in college started sueing all teachers who failed him so me and a bunch of students made a letter to the authorities and the kid decided to drop off.

You could say she is sort of locally famous. Her father is a writer and he wrote a lot of local history and she has continued that. Her career  has the chance to really take off 

A very close friend of mine recently got into her writing. He has been a huge fan of hers since he found and read a few short stories she published back in college. 

He has started buying up and collecting all her books and short stories. Even going so far as to have her sign a few. He is a teacher and is using some of her works in one of his classes and he asked her to come and talk. She agreed. They even had a lunch together after. 

I am glad they are getting along but I am super uncomfortable with him collecting items she has owned and sold or items she has signed. 

I totally get being a fan. I am a fan of her myself for other reasons.

He recently bought her father’s old writing desk in an auction and has put a picture of her and her books on it. 

I don’t want to encourage him not to like her works anymore but maybe tone it down a little bit. Maybe don’t ask me about her all the time when we get together or zoom in right on to her when she enters a room. It is a little odd I see him at every once of her public events.  I asked him if maybe he could recognize I am dating her and I don’t want to be around her super fan all the time. And not collect items that belong to her just because they belong to her. That was probably too vague. 

I found a post on a local forum about how his writing really shaped him and he felt connected to it. It read really intimate and I couldn’t help but say something to him about that. 

Maybe I am just being weird about it. My fiancée says people are just weird sometimes but she is overly nice to everyone. She says it is weird he seems to always want to talk to her at get togethers and not just me since they barely know each other.

She was kind of annoyed and panicky so I explained what happened. She said I should've just asked the guy to move, but I said that it was starting and I didn't want to make a scene. The guy came back five minutes later and shoved my shoulder and asked angrily why I was in his seat. I said that it was my seat and offered to show my ticket. He stormed off without saying anything else. A minute later he came back with a staff member and was complaining pretty loudly to her that I was in his seat. I didn't want to get kicked out of the theatre or cause any trouble or anything so I just apologized and got up. I went and sat in that empty seat that was in the middle of one of the rows and watched the rest of the play.

I met up with my girlfriend at the end and she refused to speak to me until we got back home. She was pissed. She says I should've stood my ground, but I didn't want to annoy that guy or the staff member. If he wants to sit in that seat then sure he can have it, I don't really mind it's just a seat. He bought a ticket just like me and he deserves a seat. She says I ruined our date and she just wanted to spend time with me. I wanted to spend time with her as well but I think it was just unfortunate how it worked out.

0,"AITA for not telling my wife to give a more sincere apology for scratching my father | My wife wears fake nails that are a little longer than her fingertip. She also talks with her hands. She was sitting between me and my father on the couch and talking to me enthusiastically and accidentally scratched my fathers arm when he was reaching forward.

She turned around immediately and said,” oh my gosh, are you ok?” He wasn’t bleedig or anything, but had like a 2 inch red mark from the scratch. I absolutely heard my wife say “sorry about that” to him.

A little while later my father approached me and demanded that I have my wife apologize again because she wasn’t “sincere enough.” I denied him because she did apologize and this shouldn’t be a big deal. He called her trashy and told me she couldn’t come around again until she apologized. Frankly I don’t really want to go back to my fathers house if he’s going to be that way about my wife, but am I the asshole for saying no to having my wife reapologize and for avoiding my father until he apologizes for overreacting?",False,False
0,"AITA for not wearing a bra? | I share an apartment with two other people who are married, we all pay rent and utilities. We've lived together for a few months now. I'm a well endowed woman who hates wearing bras and the first thing I do when I get home is go to my room and take my bra off. This is a bra that has been fitted for me, but I have frequent chest inflammation and taking off my bra relieves some of the pressure. 

Recently my roommates told me that they're *very* uncomfortable with me not wearing a bra in the common areas. None of us are religious and are honestly really liberal so I was shocked when I heard this. To be clear I am NOT walking around shirtless, however I will admit that sometimes I wear very form-fitting shirts without a bra but I did clarify with them this complaint applies to not wearing bras in all shirts including the loose fitting ones I wear for pajamas. 

I told them that in my mind the physical pain of me wearing a bra whenever I'm not sleeping is much more of a burden than them being uncomfortable at the sight of female nipples poking through a shirt. Other roommate with breasts says it's really not that bad to wear a bra all the time once you get used to it and in her mind it's much worse that two people are being disrespected by one person's (in?)actions, whereas I don't see my nipples being disrespectful to anyone.

1,"WIBTA for telling my friend the bitter truth about how she's become very shallow and that is the only reason she has shitty relationships. | I'm done being the shoulder my friend uses to cry on every few months after her latest relationship fuck up. 

I've known her for a long time but in  the last couple of years, she  had a health scare and  lost a lot of weight and really got herself into exercise and fitness. I support her new found positive body image and confidence but she's completely going about using it in the wrong ways. Falling for every single guy who charms her at a bar, or every other fuckboi with a gym rat body who chats up everyone in the gym uncomfortably.

1,"AITA for not sleeping in the basement during a tornado warning? | Last night when I came to bed my wife was up, frenetically  getting dressed and gathering up some blankets, pillows and stuff.  She told me we were under a tornado warning and that I needed to gather our three year old daughter up and bring her down to the basement.  Around this time, the tornado sirens started blaring.

My wife is  extremely sensitive to storms.  She gets very worried and anxious, and has confided in me that she loses sleep during nighttime storms, worrying about all kinds of disaster scenarios.  I don't shame her for these feelings, but I generally don't pander or validate them.

I got our daughter down to the basement without waking her up and we started looking at the storm tracker.  The tornado warning was in effect from 11 to 11:30.  It was now 11:15,  and the sirens had stopped.  Our house was *barely* within the confines of the warning, and it didn't seem like we were in that much danger; just caution.  Our basement has a loveseat and couch.  My wife was on the couch with our son, my daughter was on the loveseat and I made a decision; I wasn't going to be able to sleep on the floor, and headed back upstairs.

My  wife didn't seem to object to my decision.  As I kissed her goodnight, I made a joke to try and lighten the mood.  I said ""if I get blown away and you find my body, remember I want to be cremated.""

This morning, there were seemingly no repercussions.  We had plans for father's day with my mom and dad, and headed  over to their house.  Not long after getting there and my mom, out of nowhere, goes ""so you wanna be  cremated, huh?""  The comment clicked immediately, and I knew I was in trouble.  All three of them started telling me how irresponsible, selfish and insensitive I was.  My wife couldn't believe I'd leave her to try and sleep alone in the basement with fears of me blowing away in a tornado  racing through her mind.  They couldn't believe I'd risk  leaving my children fatherless just to avoid sleeping on the floor.  My dad, who I recently started working with, couldn't believe that I'd risk this new venture we've started.

At this point, I'll point out that our area was recently ravaged by an F4 tornado.  It was awful, and a lot of the damage is visible right off a highway, so we're all driving by it frequently.  It's fresh in our minds and I will admit it's chilling to observe.

In any case, the argument that ensued was drawn out and ugly.  Of course I got accused of ""ruining"" father's day.  At this moment I still don't feel like IATA, but I still might be being overly defensive, which I have a tendency to be.  AITA?",False,False

He makes a good amount of money but the money he sends to his mother a decent chunk of his monthly income. There was a rough patch in which we struggled and I always thought assumed it was because our horrible financing skills but when I learned about this I was extremely frustrated. He comes from a poorer lifestyle and I always knew his mom struggled to provide for him and his other siblings. He is already living relatively frugally and has no problem sacrificing a few things in order to help his mother out. But it frustrates me knowing that he sends that much when we could allocate it a lot better. I asked him about it and he said it was non-negotiable but I know if I push hard enough I can get him to stop.

0,"AITA for selling my engagement and wedding rings from my ex husband? | We separated about 2 years ago. We got together when I was 16, he was 18 and were together roughly 5 years before being married for nearly 4.
Without going into the gory details, he was not the greatest husband, I suffered many forms of abuse throughout that relationship but eventually found the courage to leave him.
We aren't involved in each other's lives anymore, but are still on speaking terms, but only when entirely necessary. We still live in the same (reasonably) small town and are both seeing other people.  
I pretty much tell no one the things he did to me in that relationship, only my 2 closest friends who helped me through the break up, my sister, and my boyfriend. I originally kept quiet out of respect for him because I was still in that abused 'he's not that bad' kind of mindset. Now I keep quiet just to be the bigger person. He (being the manipulative sociopathic person that he is) has spun a whole web of lies about me to all the people who knew us as a couple, leaving out every terrible thing he ever did and placing all blame on me. That's fine, it doesn't bother me any more, but I'm just trying to paint a picture of why I don't want any attachment to him.  

Anyway...  
He bought and paid for the engagement ring which was worth about $2500 (he got it half price I believe) and I bought and paid for my wedding ring* which was about $1200. I want to sell them a) because the money would be good, even though I'm sure they're not worth much now, and b) because I want to be rid of them and what they symbolise.  
My boyfriend and sister think I should sell/pawn them, but my friends don't think I should. 
They think it would just make me look bad and if people found out it would just kind of make me look like the awful person he has told people I am... I'm also scared that one day he will ask for the engagement ring back and I won't know what to tell him.  
To be clear: he has never mentioned them and never asked for them back. However if I sell them I do not plan on asking/ telling him, mainly because I'm afraid of him and don't know how he would react + It's just another story to tell about me.  
*I have no real issue selling the wedding ring as I paid for it myself .  


So WIBTA if I sold the rings without telling him?",False,False
0,"AITA for how I replied to an online businesswoman trying to get me to pay to review her product? | I(19f) have a small makeup account on instagram. I basically post pictures of my makeup and sometimes I post pictures of products I use.

As my follower count rose I started to recieve pr packages occasionally. Basically a makeup brand contacts you and they ship some of their products to you for free. A legit business won't expect you to use their products on camera, only if you get paid money (and only very big ""influencers"" actually get paid). It's basically getting free product, no strings attached.

A few days ago I got a dm from a small jewlery shop telling me that they really like the aesthetic of my page and that they would like me to try out some of their products.


I was vary at first since a lot of scams and MLM pitches start that way but I looked at their page and their business was small, but 100% real.

I said that I was interested in their offer and she sent me a long text telling me their ""requirements"":

She told me that I would get 30% off my first purchase and then I would have two post about my new jewlery once a week to get 60% off any of my future purchases.

This wasn't really what I was looking for so I thanked her for their interest in me, but I have to decline their offer.

That's when she sent this text:

""F*cking influencers, always thinking they can get everything for free"" 

And then:

""F*ck you""

I was shocked to say the least, then I got angry and I snapped. Now that's where I might be TA.

I replied back:

""Seems more like your business is failing to me...people would buy your shit if it was good and you wouldn't have to try and scam people. Good luck""

0,"AITA For Continuing to Listen to Music my Girlfriend Doesn’t Want me Listening to? | I f(24) have been listening to the Insane Clown Posse since I was 10 or so. I don’t see myself as a Juggalette or anything. I am the opposite of a stereotypical Juggalo/Juggalette.

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about a year now. We moved in together about 4 months ago.

I like laying on my bed and playing music on my phone without headphones. Not at full blast, just to where I can hear it. I only do this when my girlfriend is gone or in another room. 

The first time I did this, she was in the room next to the one I was in. I was playing ICP songs. After about 15 minutes, she asked me to either turn it down or find something else to listen to. I turned the volume down and then played other music (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, etc). Later she told me she was uncomfortable hearing the music as she didn’t like the lyrics. I completely understood and was not upset at all. 

The next day, she was in another room and I was alone in our room. I decided to listen to some music, ICP. I had the volume almost all the way down, so I could just barely hear it. The headphones were in another room and I didnt feel like getting up. I had fallen asleep after a while.

I guess she walked in while I was asleep and caught me listening to it, because after I woke up and went to go see her, she seemed pretty upset. She said something like, “I told you I didn’t like you listening to that music, stop it” or something. I didnt recall her telling me not to listen to it, just her saying she didnt like it. I told her that I wouldn’t make her listen to it and I’d keep it quiet, but I can listen to any music I want to. 

I’ve continued listening to ICP, quietly or with headphones, but she still “catches” me here and there and is obviously not happy about it. So AITA?",False,False
1,"WIBTA if I backed out of my offer to pay my ex-boyfriend's mom for the flight she purchased for me (as a gift) for an upcoming vacation? | I'm not sure how much of this background info is relevant, but just in case: My (now ex-)boyfriend and I are both broke graduate students in our late twenties and were together for 3 years. In that time, my parents paid for him to come along on two big vacations with my family. I have never gone on a vacation with his parents. My parents are lower-middle class and his are upper-middle class. We were each close with each other's families and his mom even spent Thanksgiving with my family one year. His mom has never been anything but sweet and welcoming to me. 

About four months ago his mom announced a family reunion vacation this September. She invited me to join and paid for our flights. We were both really looking forward to it, and I was grateful for her generosity.

However, unfortunately, we broke up last month. While I was the one who initiated it, it was (and still is) very hard for me. Nothing terrible happened and there were no betrayals or anything, but we had been having many communication breakdowns and incompatibilities and I reached a tipping point where it seemed like the right thing to do. It's been rough and we're both heartbroken. We're no contact right now, but not on bad terms or anything.

When we broke up, I messaged his mom to say thanks for everything, I'll miss her, and I'm sorry it turned out this way. I also (and this is where I messed up) offered to reimburse her for the flight she had bought for me since I wouldn't be coming now. I was trying to be polite and end things as maturely as possible. I sort of assumed she would decline my offer. 

She thanked me, said that she was ""sad for us both"" and then gave me her Apple Pay info so I could pay her. I was surprised at this, but it was my offer so I figured I'm on the hook now. She then sent me the receipt and said the portion I owe her is $750. This was more than I expected. My only income is my student stipend, so $750 is a lot for me. I told her I didn't have that much up front and asked if I could pay her in monthly increments of $200. She said that was fine.

I've since told my friends this and they think it's absurd that I should pay her at all since the flight was a gift. I wasn't expected to pay her if I went on the trip, so why should I if I don't go? I see their point, but think that since I offered I should just suck it up and pay now. So, WIBTA if I now backed out of my offer?",False,False
1,"AITA for not feeling sorry for everyone with loads and loads of student debt? | At some point, you have to know what it means when you say, ""Yes, please let me borrow that next $10,000. And the next. And the next."" I've seen how shitty loan servicing companies are and I know no one expected that (my wife is dealing with Navient, but her loan was only about $8k). If it were between a) signing up for a $50,000 loan (let alone $100,000 like some I've heard of) and b) finding a job to pay for junior or community college then transfer or find a company that pays for tuition and pull out all the stops to work there, I would much rather not sign my life away for the ""four year experience.""

I know it sucks. I'm not saying your ordeal is fruitless. But a flat tire comes out of no where. Rain clouds can come out of no where. But signing up for student loans was you. 

I understand the American dream of getting a college degree. My sister was the first one on my dad's side of our family to graduate college. It was a big deal.

1,"AITA for bluntly telling my daughter that she in no way is capable of parenting? | I'm almost 70 years old, my daughter is in her late 20s. I had to adopt her as I have never been able to get pregnant myself. While my daughter is married and graduated college, she is not... mentally healthy. That's just the truth.

She was a deeply disturbed child. Always unhappy, always on the edge of freaking out. I tried to help, but she never wanted to hear it. She displayed some distressing traits, but not regularly enough to get it reported. She could never focus on anything and still can't. I am shocked that none of the places she's lived in her adult life have ever burned down, because she frequently started fires as a child out of negligence.

She has always rushed for substances to cope with anything unpleasant in life. As a teenager, I had a suspicion that she was abusing cough syrup, but was never able to prove it. She has always drank too much. I'm sorry, but when you're regularly drinking entire bottles of wine and daily need a shot of liquor to ""fall asleep"", you have a problem. But she was ""doing well in school"" and then ""had a good job"" so I wasn't able to comment. I know now that she's likely just a functional alcoholic. She's always flirted with Xanax, but was never given a regular prescription.

She always wanted children. After getting married, she actually did stop with the drugs and alcohol and got pregnant three years in. She lost the baby fairly late stage (18w). I hate to say it, but that's for the best. She and her equally...not well husband held a funeral for the child, which I of course attended. 

They were devastated, and for health reasons had a full year wait to try again. The year has passed and they're having the same difficulties and more. Her husband, my son in law, is a frequent flyer in the psych ward for depression issues. She's gone back to previous drinking and now takes Xanax on a daily basis. Her old medical issues that forced her on the pill are back. 

She is in therapy that clearly doesn't work and is always in hysterics about it. I'm sorry, but objectively, this is for the best. I'd rather go to a funeral a month for the same dead child than subject a living one to a life with these two as parents, with the high chance of inheriting it themselves.

She wants to still be called a mother, which people oblige her in. I told her honestly that she needs to get herself and her partner in order before she should even think of getting pregnant and that a woman popping pills every day and washing it down with alcohol is in no way a fit parent.

My sister, myself and my husband share a home as of a few months ago. And I also enjoy puzzles. It's something I like to do to unwind (I know I'm boring at 30 years old) but it's relaxing. I've had a few old puzzles out and she's finished them on me, but I haven't kicked up a fuss 

Recently I bought a new panoramic Christmas puzzle to get me into the spirit. I asked her if she wanted to join me, she was more than welcome to, but to not do the whole thing without me.

About thirty minutes later, Jack started getting dizzy and said he couldn't breathe. We called emergency services and he was brought to the hospital were we found out that he suffered an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients in the food I served. 

Jack wants me to pay for the cost of his hospital bills, because it was my food that caused his allergic reaction. I don't think I should pay because 1. I believe it's not on me to ask every guest and their plus one if they are allergic to anything in the food I am serving, 2. He is the one with allergies so he should have asked if my food had the ingredient he was allergic to, 3. It turns out he did ask James and James told him that my daughter is also allergic to that ingredient so we don't use it. Which is true, my daughter is allergic and we don't use it when she's there but she is away in college right now so we do use that ingredient. 

My husband thinks we should just pay since it is our food that caused his reaction, we are liquid enough to pay for everything and to not make things awkward with James.

0,"AITA for leaving the surprise birthday party my wife threw for me a little early to fulfill a promise to a friend? | My wife and I have been married for 2 years. I turned 30 last Thursday. On Friday my wife threw threw me a big surprise birthday party at our house. I was completely shocked. She invited 30-35 of our mutual friends, decorated our whole house, cooked food for the event (and catered some), organized games and even got a friend to act a a DJ. The party was a lot of fun and I appreciated all the effort she put into it. I arrived at the party at around 8:00 and by 12:00 most people had left but there were still a few people there hanging around. She and her 2 sisters were starting to clean up

The thing is I have a good friend who owns a night club. That Friday was the opening day of the club and I had promised him I would make an appearance to show support.  I had mentioned this to my wife in the past but she doesn't know this guy very well an I guess didn't take it that seriously. I had also asked my wife if we had any plans that Friday and she would just say she wanted to go watch a movie, so I figured we could watch the movie and I could still go to the night club with no issue. Well alas, this surprise party happened and although I truly appreciated it, I didn't want to break the promise to my friend so at around 11:45 when the party had winded down I decided to leave to go to the club to fulfill my promise. My wife didn't make a huge deal about it at the time although I could tell she was annoyed.

However the next day she was obviously angry about it and told me she thought it was rude to just leave a birthday party she put so much effort into to go to a club and I made it seem like I didn't care. I again emphasized how appreciative I was of the party but this is something I had promised the guy but she doesn't seem to understand and says I could go to the club ""any day"" and thought was an asshole for just leeaving guests and her sisters there to clean.

Some of our mutual friends are saying the same thing and think it was weird that I just left. I think everyone is being ridiculous. I didn't know about the birthday party when I promised my friend I would show up and I just didn't want to break a promise.

0,"WIBTA if I reported my cousin to the police? | My cousin(25m), let's call him Will, got in trouble with some gang members for taking their cocaine under the pretence he'd be selling it, but instead he sold their customers bags of table salt. 

Will got caught with a whole lot of the coke by police, but marginally avoided gaol and was bailed to his parent's house.

Will's parents kept having threatening men showing up at the house demanding money. He was moved to my Gran's house a couple of hours away so the gang wouldn't find him.

My Gran(72) is starting to show early signs of dementia with very poor memory and other unusual behaviour. She is leaving for a cruise in February. 

Will's bail conditions are he has to have Gran with him at all times and he's not allowed internet access (among other conditions I don't know). Will has been telling Gran he's going for job interviews and leaving the house for a few hours at a time. He frequently uses Grans home computer for internet access. 

The family are worried that Will is fooling Gran and still accessing drugs - going off site to get his fix. We're also worried that he'll get in trouble with a local gang or the gang from his original town will find him...if they do, in our area there is a high likelihood that they will burn her house down. 

There is no one else in the family who is willing or able to take Will. Gran seems to think she is doing the right thing by taking him in, but the family would prefer he was in gaol where he can't get himself or Gran into trouble... yet no one will report that he's breaching bail conditions because he's family.

It’s extremely complicated, and she has been known to be abusive and manipulative in the past. I’ve been in town over the last few weeks since I have time off between jobs. The first week in she already started getting to me. I went to visit my brother and SIL one day and unloaded on them about my irritations with my mom. I might have said a few choice words about her too.

Anyway, things have settled the last couple of weeks and I’ve actually been enjoying my time at home. My relationship with my mom has been on an upswing. We decided to book a trip together for a few days since this will be the last time I’ll be home for a while.

When I told my SIL, she seemed shocked that I was going on a trip with my mom. I assumed it was because the last time I saw her I was upset and venting. After a couple days I received a phone call from my brother. He requested that I no longer discuss the “drama” that goes on between my mom and I to SIL because it colors her view of my MIL and she has a hard time compartmentalizing her emotions towards her when she knows what she can be capable of. He also said it makes me look hypocritical to complain so much and then go on a trip with her.

i (20f) have one other sibling, my sister (24f). we are both living at home right now, me due to my university sending everyone home for the semester and everything thats going on. my sister did live about 5 hours away for almost 3 years for her job but moved back home around early/mid february.

her and i dont have the best of relationships, she is rather temperamental and is almost always visibly annoyed whenever i interact with her. i keep my distance from her and am a rather quiet person to begin with. when i am home i usually spend most of, if not all my time in my room and only interact with my parents (and now her) when it comes to eating meals together or just having general conversation. i dont instigate with her due to the fact that she goes from 0 to 100 with me almost all the time regardless of the situation. we have had this type of relationship my entire life, things would get rather physical when we were children but it did start to improve when we got older and she moved away for school and then for her job. so i did have about 7 years of it being just me and my parents and her on holidays, and then me going away to school. things were very tolerable. when she was home things were very civil and out of the \~1-3 weeks that she would be home we would have maybe 1 or 2 arguments so everything was looking to be very hopeful and on the road to improvement.

that is unfortunately not the case. due to the current global state, my mom, sister and i have been in my home while my dad has to leave due to his job. my sister really only fully respects my dad, she treats my mom similarly to me, so having all three of us stuck within our house basically 24/7 for the last 2 weeks is the farthest thing from ideal. ive been operating the same way that i usually do, so there isnt really much if any overlap between me and my sister. but for some reason every time we do interact there has been some reason for her to go off the deep end on me. it has been constant to where i cant even exchange a couple sentences to her or even my parents without her jumping down my throat for *literally* no reason.

last night i told my mom that if my sister doesnt start to treat me like an actual human being, that i am going to not acknowledge her while i am here at home, and that once i move out i am going to basically cut her out of my life until she realizes how much of a massive bitch she is. luckily my mom did not defend my sisters actions and does realize there a large problem, BUT told me that i was being selfish, that i need to not take it personally because she treats almost everyone that way, and that i was overreacting by saying that im going to cut her off.

so WIBTA if i cut my sister completely out of my life until she actually treats me like a human being with respect?",False,False
1,"AITA for asking my sister to compromise on cooking? | Throwaway 

I’m (23M) currently staying with my sister (30F) and her boyfriend (34M) due to me living in a shared house with roommates and we needed to isolate. I’m finding everything very stressful right now due to being laid off, not being able to see my gf and being in an inclosed space. 

My sister and her bf have been very good to let me stay, the bf is currently working remotely while my sister is at home as she has had to close the restaurant she works at. So we are all constantly around each other. I am paying them a small amount of money for bills etc while I stay. My sister does most of the cleaning/ laundry and all the cooking since she is a chef. She is also vegan /strict vegetarian and the problem is I don’t really like the food she cooks. Her bf is not vegan as he occasionally eats a steak or burger at a restaurant or BBQ or something. But he eats my sister’s food at home.   

I’m already feeling stressed about the situation and the disruption to my daily life and I just want to occasionally eat something familiar that I actually like. I talked to my sister about this and she says she can’t believe I’m being so petty when there’s a global crisis going on and the food supply networks might get disturbed, so I should get used to have to change my diet a bit.  
  
I have offered to help with some of the chores in the household or do yard work if she will compromise and cook me something I can actually eat, but she says she’s not making two meals and she doesn’t want to cook with meat. She says if I want to eat meat products that’s fine, I just need to order a small fridge to store them in, thoroughly wash plates/pans after using them and buy and prepare my own food. However I don’t really have the money for constant takeouts or buying appliances right now and I don’t really know how to cook anyway. My sister told me to ‘look up some damn recipes then’ and that I’m being selfish considering how she is letting me stay in her house in the first place.

1,"AITA for missing the birth of my first child so a mate could spend time with her dying grandfather? | This is a horrible situation and I need to know if my wife is justified. 

My wife gave birth to our first baby 3 days ago. We've had a rough few years with 2 miscarriages and a stillbirth at 37 weeks. So my wife was terrified this whole pregnancy. 
I am a firefighter and was on duty when my wife went into labour. Her doctor said that it would likely be a while so I decided to stay at the base for a little longer because it is about mayhem and we're never enough people anyway. Then one of my mates gets a call that her grandfather had a heart attack and will probably not make it. Obviously she was devastated. Things got really hectic we got called out to another fire and our captain said one of us could go but not both. I told my colleague not to worry she should go and spend time with her grandfather since it will be her last chance. So I had to go out and missed the birth of my child. I got there 2 hours after my girl was born. I felt horrible and apologised profusely to my wife but she just yelled at me, said I let her down in the scariest moment of her life and then told me to leave. So I left and waited in the hallway. 
It's been 3 days and she refuses to say anything apart from the bare minimum related to the baby. They can leave tomorrow and she's informed me that she was going to stay with her sister who recently had a baby too until she ""knows what to do about our relationship or what's left of it"".

I understand that it must have been scary for her but my reasoning is that only one of us could leave and I will have a whole life to be with my child whereas my mate only had a few hours with her loved one left",False,False

Context: My roommates and I live on the 4th floor of this apartment building and one day for no reason the firealarm starts blaring.  I know this isn't a drill so I grab my coat and run out of the apartment, I don't want to be caught in the fire especially if it happened on the second or third floor.

&#x200B;

So, I hightail it out of my apartment and start running down the stairs and I can definitely smell smoke.  On the way down between the second and third floor staircase there's a woman with her kids walking down slowly.  I call out ""excuse me!"" as I run down the stairs, the mom doesn't care and so I run past and knock over one of her kids as I run down and outside the building.

My roommates join me soon after but so does the lady and she insists that I'm an asshole for knocking over her kid.  To be honest I don't think I'm an ass hole for trying to save my own life here, if anything she's the ass hole for moving so slowly on the stairs when there's a damn fire in the building.",False,False

1,"AITA for asking my friend who wrecked my car to pay for the damages when I asked her to drive? | A few days ago my friend and I went out to dinner at a pub. She doesn’t drink, but doesn’t mind that I do, and I ended up having one too many and asked if she would drive my car that we came in back to her apartment we were both staying at that night. She agreed, and along the way she hit a pothole that busted my tire. 

At the time, I didn’t care whatsoever, seeing as I was drunk, and we both changed the tire having a grand old time and resumed home. She apologized profusely and I said it was okay, it was an accident of course. A tire isn’t the end of the world. At the time she didn’t offer to pay for a replacement, but I didn’t ask her to until the next morning. 

The next morning I was clear-headed, and brought it up to her. I said “hey, I know that was an accident, but I really don’t have the money to pay for a new tire right now” and offered to split it 50/50 with her, which I assumed was more than reasonable. She blew up at me, throwing the fact that I drank and asked her to drive in my face, and again that it was an accident, but it was my car. 

We kind of went back and forth but I wasn’t great at standing my ground, and at this point we aren’t speaking. I DO feel terrible that I drank and that’s why she was driving, but it was a complete anomaly, which is also a reason I feel that we should at least split it 50/50, because it wasn’t anybody’s true fault. I probably would have hit it too. Now I just feel terrible about drinking but I thought I was doing the responsible thing.",False,False
1,"AITA for making my girlfriend cancel her birthday gift? | Next Saturday is my Birthday and my girlfriend had planned that we‘d go play lasertag with 8 of my friends. I do however not have 8 close friends and thus she invited a few guys as well that are somewhere in between an acquaintance and a friend. My girlfriend paid €220 and each of my friends would pay only €10. All 10 of us are university students and have very limited budgets. 
Originally this should have been a surprise but I asked her to tell me beforehand because I have a lot of studying to do and need to plan my time accordingly. 

I feel like she created an economic incentive for my friends and not so close friends to come to my birthday, which I absolutely hate because i‘d only want to see the friends on my birthday that also want to see me not the „friends“ that want to have fun on my girlfriends budget. Additionally I feel like she just spent too much money. 
Because of that I asked her to either let everyone know that they need to pay their own share and to tell them there is no obligation to appear after the initial commitment by them or to just call it all off and say i‘m sick, which she decided to do as the other option would have been very difficult to communicate properly. 

She is now really sad and mad at herself as she feels like she should have known i‘d not want her to pay any of that.

But today she put on a smaller tank top, and some shorts, looked in the mirror and asked if the top made her look fat.

Now my girlfriend isn’t fat per se, but she’s a little chubby. She’s still attractive, but she’s not a 2% body fat supermodel. Neither am I, but I don’t get upset if someone points it out.

I said she looked great, and she said that I didn’t answer the question. I asked if she really wanted to know the answer and she said yes. I said the top was a little small, and not super flattering. She then got mad and said that was rude and then started crying.

At this point I got annoyed, and said she shouldn’t ask trap questions if she’s going to cry about it afterwards. I gave her a perfectly nice answer in the first place, and she wanted an honest answer.

She claimed she wanted “support”. We’ve been fighting all day about it.

0,"AITA for naming my daughter after my stepsisters deceased child | When I was 8 my parents got a divorce and my father shortly afterwards married another woman. She had a daughter from another relationship who was 3 years older than me, let’s call her A

My mother died when I was 16, and her name was Amina. She was a wonderful person, kind, caring beautiful just amazing in every way. I was devastated when she died, and I guess I always knew that if I ever had a daughter, I would name her after my mum.

My stepsister A got pregnant at 21 and had a daughter who she named Ameena. At first I was surprised by the choice of name, especially considering it’s quite an Arab/ Muslim name and she doesn’t really have any links to the cultural or religious aspect. 

Another thing to note is that me and A are not close, she didn’t like me and often bullied me when I was younger, After 3 years of hell I decided to move in with my mum permanently and didn’t see my father often, but after my mother’s death I moved back with my father.

Anyways A’s daughter died when she was 10 months old due to SIDS. 10 years later, A has never had any other children after the death of Ameena.

A few months ago, I gave birth to my daughter and named her after my mother Amina. (My husband loves the name as well) It is a different spelling but essentially the same pronunciation.  My father is still married to A’s mother and we are quite close. He was shocked when I told him but understood. However A and her mother (my stepmom) think it’s incredibly disrespectful that I’ve named my daughter Amina. I have even gotten a lot of hate from friends of theirs on Facebook, who call me an Asshole.

I believe I’ve done nothing wrong especially considering I’m not close to A at all and she will never really be in my child’s life. Whilst I understand the death of her daughter must be extremely traumatic, I’ve always said that I would name my child after my mother.
My father has backed me up which has caused some issues with his wife, but has told me to reconsider her name.

I was adamant that wouldn't happen and we got Nila a 1yr old Husky German Shepherd 6 months later. To put it bluntly **I fucked up big** . Nila was too much.She needed so much exercise and attention that I basically had no time for a life because I also had school, was constantly cleaning up her damages, and Nila was not training well. So I threw in the towel and mum took over and Nila changed for the good which did hurt tbh.

I'm now 16 (17 at the end of the month) and have really matured since then. I have even done some  dog sitting for a friend and loved it! I know I'm now ready for the RIGHT type of dog.

Recently i've been hiding some stuff i buy from my family because they won't shut up about sharing. At the begining of the month, i bought some noodles because we were running out of food due to quarentine, and i made sure to buy everyone's favorite flavour. My favorite flavour is spicy chicken and my little brother favorite is just chicken. Middle of the week, i came back from work and was ready to eat my noodles but for my surprise they went missing. I asked my parents and they said my little brother said he would eat them. I confronted Thomas about it and he said i was being selfish for not sharing my noodles with him, even if he had his noodles, and i was too tired to argue so i decided to not stress about it and just went to sleep without dinner.

At the end of the week i went to the market with my mom and bought chicken nuggets and other basic stuff to stay home one more month, and also some oreos because we had some money left. One package for me and other for Thomas. As soon as we went home, Thomas ate all his oreos. Next day same thing that happened to the cup noodles happened to the oreos. I also left some chicken nuggets on the table to cool down for my dinner but he ate all of them without saying a word and when i tried to talk with him about it he said it was my fault he ate my chicken nuggets because i did not told him that they were going to be my dinner. This time i gave him the silence treatment and decided to confront my parents about it.

I think Thomas is not just being selfish but i also think he has a eating disorder. I saw some documentarys about childhood obesity. My parents never stopped him from eating anything he wants at any time of the day, since he was little. I went to talk with them arguing that he was this close to getting health issues due to their poor way of raising him, then they blamed me for being dramatic and because i was making Thomas upset for being too selfish to share my food and that i had no right to teach them about raising kids because i never had any. I got really angry and just stormed out. I started to buy stuff just for me. But they found out i was hiding food from them and said if i keep doing it they will kick me out and i told them i would only stop if they stop my brother from eating everything in the fridge. Now, at the past days, my mother started cooking food that she knows i don't eat or buying my brother his favorite snacks and nothing for me.

I talked with my friends about it and they said i'm being too harsh on him because he's just a kid and he could even get sick from wanting to eat something so much but not eating it (that's a popular saying where i live) and that i should apologize to my parents for saying they were raising him wrong.

Sally was hurt and Jim was angry, he said that of course she is going to parent the kids, but she has always made it clear she is their 'co-parent' and that she loves them as if they were her own but they have a mum. 

Jim said Sally doesn't have to let Him use her car to get them to school, or drive them to see me (he pointed out i dont pay for gas or wear'n'tear on the car), that she doesn't have to send me photos of the kids, Jim doesnt have aphone, or answer when I call. That Sally changed everything in her life for my kids, turning the spareroom from her personal area to a bedroom, getting a 4door car to fit 3 carseats/boosters, making allergy sensitive meals for my daughters and sharing her living space everyday. 

I feel like I'm right, they are my kids, even though they live in her house. She shouldn't be at their school, talking to the other parents and volunteering. She shouldn't be telling my kidsto say Pardon instead of What, thats MY job. Her parents shouldn't be so involved, she should just let them live there and Jim be just the Dad. No Co-parent, no stepparent, just one parent, and parental figure. I'm so madthat Sally believes that she isnt doing anything wrong. Now she's refusing to drive down on the weekend, I was going to have the girls overnight, because the gas and hotel would cost too much and Sally also wants to see her grandparents before they go on a trip.

0,"WIBTA if I send my mother a letter of grievances and don’t invite her to my college graduation? | I was never a “good” kid. I always got into trouble in school and this obviously put a strain on my parents. However, by the time I was about 13 I cleaned up my act. I started to actually excel in school and eventually got pretty involved with JROTC. When I was 15 I decided to take Calculus and Physics at the nearby community college the following fall, because my high school didn’t offer them. At around the same time, my mother, who had just returned from a trip to her home state of Oregon, began to talk about moving away from rural Arkansas where I grew up. 

This is where things started to get pretty complicated. Late spring of that year, my mother called me into her room and asked me if she “could leave.” At first I wasn’t sure what she was asking, but she explained her plan was to go back to Oregon to find work. Then, once she was stable, we could all join her. In the meantime, my stepfather would stay with me. However, my parents quickly found out they could not afford rent on two places at once and convinced my older sister to rent the house and take care of me. My stepfather went to go live with my step-grandparents(sgp) down the road to take care of my sick sgp.

Things went fine until winter when my sister decided to move out to her boyfriend’s. I thought that one of my parents would come back and stay in the house with me, but instead I went to my sgp and, along with my stepfather, they asked me straight up, at 16, “What are you going to do?” I had a job, but it could not cover nearly everything. I ended up staying with friends for long periods of time, eventually working up the nerve to ask “Could I live with you?” Unfortunately, a lot of people are taken aback by questions like that and I always felt awkward asking. However, eventually, I was allowed to stay on a sheep farm for $300 a month. I couldn’t afford it because my job refused to give me more hours, but it was the only option I had. I begged my parents to cover the difference and after a bit of back and forth, they agreed.

Thankfully, from there, my life began to change. In my Junior year of high school, I received a full scholarship to boarding school. At boarding school, I found a love for mathematics and have gone on to study math at one of the top private universities in America. Next year I will graduate, and I don’t want to invite my mother to graduation. I am partly still upset that even though all this shit has happened, we have never talked about it. And partly upset because nothing has changed. Recently she has been contacting me asking about graduation, but I am on the fence. I don’t think she has made a good faith effort to get to know me or be present when it mattered and only at the end of college does it seem she might care. She did not even try to come to my graduation from boarding school. So, WIBTA if I sent my mother a letter explaining why I feel this way, and informing her she is not to come to my graduation?",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting my fiancé’s parents to pay for our wedding because I’m worried my parents will be hurt? | This is thorny. My fiancé and I got engaged a few months ago and are now wedding planning. 

His family is very wealthy, much more so than mine. After hearing the news they offered us 60k to help pay for the wedding, which is an insane amount to me. Anyways my fiancé was overjoyed because we were planning on paying for it out of pocket (~10k) and now we don’t have to spend anything. 

HOWEVER, I don’t want to take their money. For one thing I don’t feel comfortable having them pay for a wedding when my parents can’t contribute in any way. It would feel like my parents are “lower status guests” at the wedding in my opinion, since only one side would be splashing cash around. 

My parents are a lot less well off than his and it’s something that’s given me pause in the past before. I just don’t want our wedding of all things highlighting this fact. 

But the issue now is that I have 0 savings due to recently graduating school so the entire 10-20k for the wedding would come out of my fiancé’s personal savings. He can’t understand why I’d rather spend our own (or “his”) money than his parents free money but I feel like he’s being intentionally selfish/cold hearted by not considering my parent’s feelings.",False,False
1,"AITA walking away from a vet bill i caused | (cant think of a better way to sum that up that doesnt become convoluted or make you want to just scroll past)

TLDR: dog i was walking attacked another, i promised to pay the vet bill and it was agreed it could be paid over time. The dog (i was walking) owner told me not to worry about it, hell handle it. Carer of the other dog refuses to contact the owner directly after payments were missed so i told her im no longer responsible for paying the bill and if it gets done, shes threatened to lawyer up

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, heres what happened first off

&#x200B;

Mum had an aggressive dog who i walked sometimes (on leash). On walks I always made sure to muzzle her just in case, because of her aggression, one day i didnt

&#x200B;

There was a small dog across the road and Ruby noticed it before i did and she bolted.

&#x200B;

The small dog ended up being flown to a vet surgeon to get its gut sewn back together. The owners didnt report Ruby

&#x200B;

All in all my fault 100% it happened. Ruby wasnt wearing a muzzle, I wasnt being vigilant etc. Thats not the question

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The old mans carer came out and talked to me and told me they wont report Ruby but that the old man cant afford the vet bill if the little dog makes it. I told her not to worry about, I'll make sure its paid. Essentially anyway

&#x200B;

I told my stepdad what happened, and he told me not to worry about it, Ruby is in his name, hell pay for it and sort it out. It shouldnt have been my job to walk her in the first place. This is what he told me

&#x200B;

So I contacted the carer and I told her that the payments would be made from my stepdad, Rubys owner. She said she doesnt care where it comes from as long as it does come, and agreed to a payment plan of whatever we could afford as long as it happened

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A couple months pass, no contact, when she sends me a message tellin me her brother is a cop (relevance?) and she is willing to take this to court to make sure this vet bill gets paid (little dog made it) I asked her what she meant and she said only two payments have come through. I couldnt get ahold of my stepdad to see what was up, but, on the advice of my sister and housemates, I gave her my stepdads direct number so she could talk to him

&#x200B;

I made clear that Ruby was my stepdads dog and he has made himself responsible for the bill

&#x200B;

So Ive decided if she contacts me again about payment I just wont respond. I told her something along the lines of how her best bet was to contact my stepdad and if she decides against it then I wont be held responsible for any payment or lack thereof. I wont be chasing it up, the owner of the dog has release me from that responsibility

&#x200B;

I cant remember her response but it had something to do with a lawyer

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Its been 4 months and nothing more has come of it

Everyone is currently employed or in school except Brett.

My mom still has to go in to work as her job has been classified as essential, I have been working from home since the second week of March due to what's going on right now and everyone else has either been laid off or stopped working due to slow business (my dad is self employed). So it's just my mom and I working and paying all the bills, me more than my mom as I earn almost triple than she does and I told her to save her money for retirement. I work from 8-4pm and mom works from 2pm-11:30pm. 

I work for a bank (transitioned from a contract role to permanent the first week of March) and am working out of my bedroom, my job requires quiet to focus and my family has been alright at keeping it down when I ask, but after 10-15 minutes of quiet they start getting louder. Watching tv, listening to music or having conversations.

I kept a log of how many times I had to ask them to keep it down on Thursday and Friday...over 20 times both days! It's really frustrating as I don't feel appreciated and it's annoying to have to ask grown adults to be quiet. Half the time I ask they laugh at me, especially my sisters.

Everyone sleeps in until at least 10AM since they aren't working and because my mom works the night shift she doesn't get up until 11.

Anyways, I've been in bed since 11PM and have to be up by 6AM to get ready for work. It's currently 12:35AM and I have not been able to fall asleep yet as my entire family is awake right now. 

Mom is watching Youtube videos in the living room with the volume turned all the way up (cause she as hearing problems) and won't accept my offer to use my ipad or laptop to watch with headphones as she doesn't like wearing headphones. My brothers are in the basement, which is right below my bedroom, playing video games on the PS4 and the computer. My dad just went to sleep, but turned a movie on his phone at full blast. My sisters are in their bedroom watching Youtube videos and having a very loud conversation.

Everyone is using the internet to do all of this, which has been under my name for the past two years. Prior to that it was under my dads name, but I paid the bill.

0,"AITA for asking my girlfriend to help me out with rent and bills because she lives with me now? | I will try and keep this story very mutual as i understand you are only hearing it from my side of the view. Some history about me, I have had some very poor relationships and I know I am not the perfect guy, however I am 'too nice' sometimes which makes people walk all over me. I had a job where I didnt require a place to live due to excessive travel. It was a wonderful job and I unfortunately got let go. This amazing woman let me move in with her and her family and she has really been there for me when times are tough. I had enough money to get my life back on track and within one month of living at her parents with her I got a car, job and an apartment. I got the apartment in my name because i have been through a relationship before where things ended up not working out and I was screwed. I guess you learn from your previous relationships. She helped me move into my new apartment along with helping me buy new furniture and she came with me to purchase my new car. She has really been there for me. She immediately moved in with me and I could tell after a month she wasnt that comfortable. Maybe it was because of the drastic change from her parents? or maybe it was because we moved towards the big city? I still will never know but I could tell she was very uncomfortable. 

My wake up costs are nearly $3000 dollars. Yes i know this sounds like a lot but my new job was paying well. Rent $1650, Car $400 with insurance, Phone bill, other bills, student loan. Yes it comes close to about $3000 dollars. Insane right?

Well fast forward 5 months later, I asked her to help me out with rent even if she could pay me $500 and possibly groceries. anything as this point because it is very expensive for me to be paying for both of us. She works full time 40 hour weeks. She makes about $3000-$4000 per month before taxes. She would never help me out!

Its getting to a point where I am coming off as a dick now because she is not helping me pay the bills at all, and i keep confronting her. Her excuses make me even more upset like how she said she pays her sisters gym pass and she doesnt even go. how does this effect me or even us? One of my friends asked if she splits the rent (idk why he asked but i was standing right there) She blatantly lied and said yes she helps a lot. I confronted her about this, she still just plays completely dumb about it and tells me she has no money and comes up with excuses where her money goes. 

I cant keep doing this. I told her 'love' isnt enough to keep this together if she wants to be in a relationship it needs to be made together it feels very one sided right now....  It just sucks because im not that kind of guy that would just end it based off something like this but enough is a enough.

0,"AITA for spooning/bear hugging my girlfriend on the air mattress in her parents living room | My girlfriend and I are thinking about getting married so we’re visiting her parents together before we actually get serious about it. They put an air mattress in the living room for us because they don’t have a guest room. I personally wanted to stay in a hotel but my girlfriend said that it was worth saving the money.

When we sleep together(literally) I tend to bear hug my girlfriend. Imagine if you wanted to tightly hug a pillow(which is how I slept before), I do that with my girlfriend. And she loves it. She used to sleep with a super heavy weighted blanket to sort of simulate being held, and she doesn’t use it anymore. So no problems with her.

But last night we slept how we normally do, and her parents woke up before us and came into the living room and saw us. They got super pissed off and said we shouldn’t be doing that when we’re sleeping out in the open and it’s inappropriate. We were both wearing full length pajamas, it’s not like anything was going on. My girlfriend says I should just let it be and apologize but I don’t see what we’ve done wrong?

1,"AITA for not giving my girlfriend cocaine? | Occasionally, some friends and I (M22) do coke on a night out. Like with any hard drug there are major risk factors involved and you always hear horror stories. But I try as far as possible to be responsible when partaking and since I've also done my fair share of substances in the past, can also keep track of my body and know when to call it quits.

Today we are going on a pub crawl and my girlfriend of 3 years (F20) asked me if she could try some. I refused to give her any. She hasn't tried much except for weed and I feel as though she doesn't know much about these sorts of drugs and has only really heard about their effects from my experiences with them. Aside from that, my main reasoning is that I care deeply for her and seriously don't want anything to happen to her. Even more so, if something did and it was because of me, I'd never forgive myself really. She trusts me and my judgement so I don't want to betray that by giving her a substance her body may react poorly to.

Anyway, she lost it at me and her point is obviously that she is an adult and can do as she pleases. Fair enough, I also told her that if she wants to go source it and pay for it herself, I cannot stop her. I'd still be uncomfortable with it... But I wouldn't be the one enabling her or dealing to her.

I am protective of her, but am I being overprotective? Most of them time I don't think I'm like this. I feel like a hypocrite, but giving her hard drugs has always been a sensitive area for me.

0,"AITA for not washing my hair? | Last night, I (f, 31) was cooking a dish that requires a lot of onions to taste right - I chopped about 3 onions. My boyfriend (m, 31) complains every time I cook onions because he says they make his eyes hurt. I offer to stop almost every time he complains, but he says he likes to eat them so I should still cook with them. I also rinse the onions before I cook with them because he tells me that helps minimize the sting although I have my doubts about whether that works.

I was slowly caramelizing the onions when about partway through, he started protesting that his eyes hurt and they were stinging. I was in the kitchen and he was in the living room, but it's an open concept space. At some point I went to hug him but he had to run away from my hug because he said my hair must be trapping the onion scent and the hair was pushing the scent into his eyes. 

The dish takes a long time and I was making a lot so we could have leftovers, so eventually he fled to the bedroom with the door closed because he said his eyes hurt so much and he couldn't take it anymore. I didn't tear up at all, by the way, not even when I was chopping them. Sometimes I'm affected, but not this time. 

I didn't finish until about two hours later, past eleven pm (I didn't cook as efficiently as I should have, so it took me way longer than I expected). Because I was exhausted, I showered and went to bed without washing my hair since I washed it the day before and I'm not a daily hair washer anyway. I was hoping that after so much time, the raw onion would no longer be in the kitchen air, in my hair, etc. But it wasn't the case, because after I got into bed my boyfriend said my hair was still making his eyes hurt and he was upset that I didn't wash it. 

I was very tired and sleepy and I had work the next day, so I didn't get out of bed to wash my evil hair and I just told him I was sorry but I was very tired after cooking so much. I went to sleep while he complained about his eyes.

I tried to reach out to him, get him to be more involved, and he says he has anxiety around babies because prior to his daughter, he'd never changed a diaper or really interacted with any children, baby or otherwise. He tells me his experience with kids is limited to the times he was a kid himself. Contrastingly, I've been much more involved with children my whole life.

My niece is 5 feet tall and 145 pounds. She gets teased at school and she's pretty unhappy at this weight. My sister serves a lot of junk food and sabotages my niece's health. She's a single mom and the dad is not in the picture. She uses food as a comfort tool for the both of them. My sister always uses excuses, such as that my niece won't eat vegetables or she's too picky. 

At my house, Friday is usually pizza night, but we eat healthy the rest of the week to make up for it. Sometimes, the food that my niece gets at my house will be her only serving of fresh fruit or vegetables, so when she comes over, I cancel pizza night. The reason that I give is that it's not polite to order pizza for guests and I'd rather serve something fancier. It's usually flown under the radar. Instead, I would make roast chicken and vegetables with fruit for dessert, or a quinoa dish with vegetables and chickpeas. My niece would participate in the cooking and she's certainly capable of eating healthy food. 

One night, my kids, who are 9 and 11, told my sister that it's unfair that we cancel pizza night on Fridays and asked her if they could come over another night. My sister asked me to clarify, and I said I cancel pizza night because niece loves to explore new dishes that I make for her. she told me that I'm singling out my niece and fat-shaming her.

1,"AITA for being upset that a waitress spilt coffee all over me at a work event, as an intern? | tl;dr: Waitress spilt coffee all over me and drenched all of my shirt at a work brunch. I have anger management problems but did my best staying calm - so all I did was vent to my coworkers about it while the waitress was gone. I told a full-timer I expected compensation of some sort for her actions since I shouldn't have to deal with a ruined shirt. The full timer dry cleaned it herself with her money and brought it to me later. My boss said she was embarrassed. This was 2 weeks before my internship at Google ended and I had no time to redeem myself - so I did not get the full time job offer.

This summer I had the pleasure of being an intern with Google for their business side, I did customer experience for Google Ads. On a Saturday we had an optional event where we went to brunch. I was sitting in the middle of the table - it was split with interns on one side, and full timers on the other. I sat next to my boss as well. Everything was going great, we were all talking and what not. Next thing you know, the waitress bumps into me (I am sitting down the whole time, so I wasn’t at fault here at all) and she spills cold coffee all over the back of my white t-shirt. The whole back of it was drenched. She did apologize for the mistake and tried to go get towels.

When she leaves to get towels, my intern group is laughing at me since they thought it was funny. Well for background, I am sensitive and get booty hurt easily. So I was visibly upset. When the waitress left to get towels, they asked why I was upset. I let them know and they asked what I expected her to do since it was an accident. I told them that I expected there to be consequences for her actions because my white Nike t-shirt that costs like $40 will now be stained. I said she should make it up to me somehow by reimbursing for dry cleaning. She came back and gave me the towels and it was not enough - I asked if she had any souvenir shirts that they sell that I can have to wear since drying the shirt wasn’t feasible.

As she did this, one of the full timers pulled me aside and we walked to the side of the restaurant and talked. She said I wasn’t being “googley” enough and that I wasn’t representing Google properly. I told her that I have anger management problems and that I was doing my best at keeping my cool. I told her that by venting to the interns (while she was away) was my outlet to making me feel better. I told her that I wanted my shirt dry cleaned. This full timer said to just keep quiet and she will take care of it. She ended up taking my shirt later that day and brought it to me the next week.

Fast forward and my boss told me at our weekly 1:1 meeting that she was embarrassed about it and that I should apologize to the group and full timers for acting like that. This was 2 weeks before the internship ended, so there was no time to redeem myself. I ended up not getting the job offer. I know this is what mainly caused it because I hit all my performance metrics and was the 2nd best on the team in terms of job performance. But since it's Google, they look mainly for ""Googleyness"" which means they look for good people and aren't so worried about performance.

So… Am I the asshole for acting like this? I do have anger management problems and honestly this was the best in this scenario. I was so upset, but I never once showed it to the waitress. I was never loud about it, just venting to the team. Was it reasonable to want my shirt dry cleaned? Why should I have to suck it up and lose money?

0,"AITA for not letting my mom smoke at my house? | My wife and I decided not to allow anyone to smoke over at our house any more, even my mom who is a heavy smoker. We have a young child with another due to be born in a month. 

There are of course many health reasons why you wouldn’t want 2nd or 3rd hand smoke around babies and children, and additionally the smell , even on clothes, gives my wife a very bad headache and makes her feel sick.

We had let her stay the night before as she lives about 3 hours away. Every time she has stayed it takes us days to air out the house to where we don’t smell it any more.

I can tell she is very hurt by this and does not really understand, and she says that she feels unwelcome in our home. I can understand that she may have an emotional reaction at first and feel this way but I am very frustrated that she is acting like we have banned her from ever seeing her grandchildren or that we dislike her as a person. 

She is still welcome to come and visit/stay but all we ask is that she not smoke. She can vape, chew nicotine gum, get a patch, we don’t care as long as she isn’t lighting up. Smoking down the street or wearing a jacket while she does isn’t an option, we tried that and the odor is still an issue for us. 

I feel like she is choosing her cigarettes over her grandchildren. I know it’s an addiction but surely asking her to go a few hours without smoking isn’t unreasonable.

1,"AITA for not wanting my dog to always be in my room with me? | Just for clarity, I love my dog to death and he's a sweetheart. We sleep in the same bed on most days and I honestly find comfort in that.

Here's the reasoning for this post. I am roommates with my sister and we work sort of opposite schedules. Most nights, I work 7p to 7a and most days, she works 7a to 330p with a 10a to 7p shift about twice a week. 

When I get home from work, my sister is already gone, so I do my morning/pre sleep routine and grab the pooch before going to bed and we go to sleep for  most of the day, for which he's normally pretty chill about and let's me sleep until I wake up.

Only sometimes, my sleeping overlaps when my sister gets home and when he hears her come through the door, he goes bonkers with excitement. He's a small dog, a silky terrier, but he does it all. Barking, whining, jumping off the bed, vaulting off my back, basically ensuring I wake up long enough to open my door and let him go greet my sister before closing my door again and going back to sleep.

I can't sleep with my door open. Even if someone opens it while I'm asleep, I tend to wake up almost immediately because the feeling is off. The bad thing is, my doorknob is broken so it can't lock and my little dog can push it open with relative ease. If I try to ignore the door opening to sleep some more before work, he's whining and scratching at the bottom of my bed to be let on. If I try to block my door so he stays out with my sister, he is scratching and whining at my door loudly until I get up to bring him back inside and on my bed. No guarantee he'll stay on my bed because he may jump down to sniff around and then whine to come back up.

I have asked my sister a lot to keep him entertained while I sleep. Or, at the very least, keep an eye on him. She will for a little while before just sitting on her phone or her laptop at the other end of the house while he comes back to my door again and she typically says 'she didn't realize he left the room'. Especially this on the weekends when I still have to work but she's off and he wants to do this 'wake up' routine earlier when he hears her moving around. Honestly, it makes me frustrates when I try to rest before work but have him constantly trying to wake me up.

Like I said, I dearly love my dog, but AITA for getting frustrated about this? It's almost every day this happens and I just want my sleep sometimes. But I still feel guilty because I know he constantly wants to be near me or my sister but still.",False,False
0,"AITA for requesting a new nurse because my usual one always smells of cigarettes? | I’m a dentist, I don’t own the practice but I work for a large corporation which owns many practices in the area. They provide the nurses. I only work at this place once a week but have had the same nurse for around a year. She’s not a heavy smoker but would usually go out for a smoke two or three times a day

She’d only go if she had the time to spare and is usually a good nurse albeit I do have to remind her about washing hands regularly and other basic hygiene things. 

I’ve talked to her a few times about the smell when she returns from her smoke breaks a few times and her usual course of action is to spray a load of deodorant on which I feel doesn’t really fix the problem. It just mixes with the smoke smell to make an even heavier suffocating smell.

1,"WIBTA if I rescinded my offer to pay for my friend's lodging? | When I was very drunk, I offered to pay my friend's ski lodging for his birthday weekend so we could all go skiing at a resort, because he was waffling on going or not because of the price. When I was sober, he reminded me of this fact, and I told him I didn't want to pay anymore, and I'm sorry I offered that. He said he didn't know if he wanted to go anymore, so I offered to pay 50% because I was really desperate for the trip to happen and I needed more people.  

This was last week. After reflecting on this, I realize I don't want to pay for any of it and I think he manipulated me. Although it still is my fault for getting drunk and offering in the first place.  The biggest reason I want to rescind the offer is that he has pulled some bad stuff with money in the past. For example, one time we split a bottle of liquor and he thought I drank a couple more shots than him, so when I Venmo requested him, he demanded me re-Venmo request him the liquor minus $1.50. A couple months ago, we all planned to go away for a fall cabin so I counted him in, and booked the AirBnb, we actually planned this trip together. Then the day before he decides he doesn't want to go, leaving me with the whole bill. He refuses to pay his part because he isn't going. But it was too late to cancel. In general, he plans nothing but expects to be catered to. But this is his birthday weekend, and I offered to pay. In general, I tend to be overly accommodating and plan everything, put it on my card, make concessions, and try to acquiesce to people when they aren't happy which is how I got myself into this situation in the first place, because I offered something I wasn't willing to give and I will resent him for it. WIBTA if I told him I made a mistake and he could either pay his entire lodging, or not come? Or should I suck it up? 50% of his lodging for me would be $60 extra, so I would pay $200 instead of $140. I can afford it, but so can he, he makes great money.

He was with another friend of ours while making the call, and asked if that friend was invited.

He asked me who was invited and for explanation of why certain people were not invited.

He asked about staying in town a week after the wedding to spend more time together.

I told my wife-to-be he is just very excited, he wants everyone to be there, he wants to have fun and spend time with us. She thinks it was all very inappropriate. She is particularly mad that he asked to hang out for days after the wedding. She said we already have friends and family still in town for 1-2 days after, but asking to spend the week after the wedding with a newly married couple is highly inappropriate and highjacking their occasion.

0,"AITA for doing my goddaughter’s eyebrows? | I have a goddaughter who is 12 years old, Mia. 

Yesterday Mia’s mom (my best friend) called me because she finally got a double shift at work and needed someone to be with Mia. I’m just chilling at home so I told her to drop her off. Mia and I are really cool. We always watch a couple of movies and pop some popcorn when she comes over. 

Mia is blessed with beautiful, dark full brows. They contrast her lighter hair, in a very nice way. It gives her a very unique look. She does have a a unibrow though. 

 I do hair and eyebrows professionally, so I always notice and compliment Mia on them. She is self conscious about them. 

When I complimented her on them yesterday, she teared up a bit. She said that she is being bullied badly in school and that they send around a meme on Snapchat of a smiley face with a unibrow to mock her. She was so happy when school got cancelled (but they are still sending the meme!!!)

It broke my heart, I asked her if she told her mom and she said that her mom told her that they were just jealous. She asked me if I do my eyebrows, and I said “ yes. A lot of ladies do their eyebrows.”

She asked me if I could to anything to her eyebrows, I said maybe. I text her mom to ask, explaining what I was going to do, and we watched a movie. The movie went off and I didn’t get a response. So I went ahead and did her eyebrows. I plucked the middle and shaped them up slightly, mostly maintaining their natural shape. 

She was so happy. She probably stood in the mirror for half an hour looking at herself. She just lit up and came out of her shell. 

When her mom showed up to get her, Mia was eager to show her new eyebrows. Her mom was sooo mad though. She started yelling at me in front of Mia. 

She’s all, “Who told you to do this? Got my baby looking grown, she’s a little girl you don’t need to be doing anything to her face.” 

I was like, “girl she loves it, she is so happy. I will do all of the upkeep for free no problem, and I’ll teach her how to do them herself. You do your eyebrows too!” 

She didn’t care what I had to say, and took Mia (crying) off. She sent me texts later saying that she was disappointed In me she doesn’t have any family and depends on me as a friend to help her with Mia, I’m one of the few people she had and I let her down.

0,"AITA for supporting and visiting my stepson while he is in prison against his father (my ex-husband) and mother's wishes? | My 19 year old stepson pleaded guilty to a violent crime and will be going to prison for a very long time, perhaps the rest of his life. I don't want to go into the details of his crime, but he admitted to doing it and is ready to receive his punishment. There were some mitigating factors, but that does not really matter. He did the crime and he pleaded guilty and he won't be leaving prison anytime soon.

When his father and I married, I was much younger than he was and I was naive about the situation. Stepson was 14 and his mom and dad fought over the joint custody of him. His dad is the type of man who thinks that being a parent is more about owning a child than actually loving them, so he would ignore his son as much as possible and would only pay attention when stepson was in trouble. His mom is a functioning alcoholic. Both his parents have high paid jobs that they focused on more than their son.

Stepson was basically allowed to do whatever he wanted and was often in trouble. Drugs, fighting, stealing, he was arrested more than once as a teen. I was pretty much the only one he would listen to and it caused some problems in my relationship with his father. His father and I divorced partly because I could not handle the drama and stress in that relationship. Before I left, I told stepson that if he ever needed me, I would be there for him.

Fast forward a few years and I got a phone call from stepson in jail, saying that he did something bad and needed help. He had tried calling his mom and dad, but they both hung up the phone on him. When I tried calling his dad, he never answered the phone and ignored my calls. I didn't want to abandon stepson, so I helped him get a lawyer and stood by his side during the legal process. Stepson knows he messed up and all he can do now is try to become a better person. 

His father found out that I had helped him and ever since, he has been calling (I don't answer) and texting me about it. He thinks that his son needs to face the consequences of his actions alone and that by helping him, I am enabling him and that he should be left to rot alone in prison. His mom left me a vicious voicemail and read me the Riot Act about being involved and that it wasn't my place to do anything in stepson's life. 

I asked my boyfriend about it and he thinks I am involving myself in a situation where I don't belong and that stepson deserves to be cut off from everyone. That if his hypothetical stepson had committed that crime, he would be so disgusted that he doesn't know how I can look past it to visit him in prison. And I know that what stepson did was awful, but I don't think anything is black and white in this world. He committed a crime, but it does the world no good to throw him away and not give him any chance of redemption.

1,"AITA for letting someone walk into me | Firstly, let me start by saying that one of my big pet peeves in life is people walking (or driving) in public whilst not looking where they're going. 

So, a while ago, I was walking down the street with my friend. We noticed that, coming the other direction, was a professional looking woman in her late 40s/early 50s. We also noticed that she was engrossed in her phone and not, at any point, looking up to check her surroundings. We were fated to be on a collision course if we both kept going in a straight line.

As a matter of principle, I decided to hold my course. I was staring at her intently for about 10-12 seconds (whilst continuing to walk forward), waiting for her to look up and notice that we were there. I would have been happy to move a little if she had seen us but I chose not to. 

Inevitably, we collided. Only a brush of shoulders but it was enough to dislodge her phone from her hand. I didn't stick around to assess the damage but the sound of phone hitting floor and the mutterings of sadness I could hear from her were enough to assume the phone had some damage.

I could have easily taken a step to my left (she would have then cut through me and my friend) as it was a wide path but I didnt think I should have to move for someone who can't look where they're going.

0,"AITA for wanting divorce mainly because wife has never been to work for last 9 years? | I'm a foreigner, living in a European country and married a local there. After marriage, I said she should look for a job as the life was very expensive there and almost all of my salary was being used to pay bills and everything. After one year, she said she wanted to study master degree as it would help her to get a job that she wants. I agreed, she enrolled and completed a 2 year degree in almost 4 years.

After that I asked that she should be looking for jobs, and she sometimes sends the applications. But it seems to me that she has given up on everything. Most of the day she is on her computer playing video games, and then sleeping almost all day.

It is literally impossible to talk to her. As soon I try to talk, it always follow the same pattern:

**Step 1:** Crying

**Step 2:** Shouting while giving reasons: ""I am applying for jobs, what can I do if no one wants to give me job?""

1,"AITA for being furious with my fiancé because he's excited about Game of Thrones tonight when my grandfathers funeral was just on Friday? | I will say up front, I am devastated and may not be thinking rationally. My grandfather raised me for several years off and on after my mom died and my dad was in the Navy. He is one three people (the other's being my dad and fiancé) that I truly love the most on the planet. He was absolutely fine on April 18th, on April 19th he had a massive heart attack and was gone instantly.  I am literally beside myself with grief. We had planned on spending the summer driving around the area where he grew up in Northern Louisiana so he could show me where he was born, where he went to school and on and on. I am beside myself that among everything else we won't be taking this trip and I'm in the middle of cancelling reservations and have to explain that my grandfather died over and over to hotels and airlines. It's just a constant reminder of how sad I am. This comes after planning a funeral, going to the funeral, dealing with hundreds of people telling me how sad they are and on and on. 

My fiancé had been really great through the whole process and was a lot of help to me and my dad. I have to give him that. But this morning I was literally on the phone with United Airlines trying to explain why we won't be going on the trip, asking if ""proof of death"" is really necessary. 

In the other room I heard my fiancé on the phone with someone and he said ""I am so fucking excited about game of thrones tonight, I haven't been looking forward to something like this for months!""

I lost my shit, like literally hung up with the airlines and started screaming at him that not only are we getting married and he should be looking forward to that and plus what the fuck, my grandfather just died and he has the nerve to be pulling this shit with me now. After all I'd been through in the past two weeks to hear him say that the thing he is ""most"" excited about is a fucking TV show? I kicked him out of the apartment and told him I never wanted to see him again (which of course isn't true). 

He just texted me that he's giving me some time to chill out and he'll come home whenever I'm ready to see him again. Now that he said that and didn't get mad at me, I feel really bad. Am I an asshole or am I just not thinking clearly because of grief?",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my sister that I will always see her as a sister and never a mother? | I'm 21 and my older sister is 35. I was raised as her little brother since birth. Two years ago I found out that my sister is actually my biological mother and that my parents who raised me are biologically my grandparents. It was a shock to me but I've had two years to process this information and I think I've come to terms with it. I still consider my grandparents as my parents. I was raised by loving and caring parents and never had to want for anything. I love them dearly. 

On the other hand my sister and I had a very difficult relationship growing up especially during my teenage years. I felt that she was extremely overbearing and overprotective. Even though my parents allowed me to go out with friends and gave me a curfew (11pm) my sister would often call and demand to know where I was, what I was doing, who I'm hanging out with etc. She tried to stop me from doing things she thought were too dangerous. She tried to stop me from swimming in our condo swimming pool because there was no life guard there despite the fact that the pool is tiny and not very deep. She also secretly asked her boyfriend to tail me and my friends when we went cycling at the beach because she was afraid I would drown in the ocean. I was 17 at the time. Me and my friends were cycling and I turned around and saw her boyfriend casually following us on a rented bicycle. It spoiled my mood and ruined the outing. At the time I thought she was just being a weird, overprotective sister. My friends all thought she was really weird. None of their older sisters behaved this way. But now it all makes sense. 

Since she revealed to me the truth about my adoption she thinks she can transition into a more parental figure in my life. I am really uncomfortable with that. I was raised for many years as her brother. It's just strange to see her as a parental figure after so many years. She made an emotional post on facebook about how she finally told her ""son"" the truth and ""reconnected with him"" as a mother. I didn't say anything at the time but was very uncomfortable with it. Yesterday she reintroduced me to a family friend as her ""long lost son"" in front of my mother/grandmother. I was pissed and said out loud that she is my sister and will always be my sister. She's not my mother and will never be my mother. I can't explain why I was so angry. But I was really furious. She burst into tears and left the room. Didn't come out for the rest of the night.

I admit I instigated it by wording something poorly that she took the wrong way and it became a misunderstanding. After the misunderstanding happened, I tried to explain to her what I meant and apologize for how what I said came across.

Well things kind of went in a wrong direction from there because she began to tell me how she feels like we've grown apart since college and how she feels we are different people now. I asked her if one argument between us could really change our entire friendship and reminded her of all the things I've done for her in the past and how she has misunderstood me multiple times in the past but I never once held that against her and just apologized and moved on because I care more about our friendship than petty disagreements.

Well this seemed to cause even more issues because she accused me of holding the past over her head and not accepting how she feels. She even said something random about how I always try to act like I'm on some higher moral ground than her, which really confused me because I'm not telling her how to do anything, just explaining how I am as a friend and how I feel like she doesn't care about me the same way I do about her.

She ended up calling me and telling me she needs to figure some stuff out and thinks it's best if we're not friends and that maybe our paths will cross again in the future but for now that it's not working.

This is my first time posting and mum thinks im being unreasonable but would like to know if I would be a Ahole 

Lil bit back story (me in my 30s) found out around the same time my much younger sister (24) got pregnant due in Feb next yr  and I am basically infertile PCOS with strong possibility of  Endometriosis so while im grieving my choice of wanting kids in the future is pretty much taken away from me (as I pictured myself as older mum)

But not once have I rained on her parade, I told her about mine doc results and notes, she shrugged it off, but it is whatever my sis can be self centred and well being a first mum I guess its expected shes excited  for herself and I was for her, still am certain degree..

Anyho she already TOLD me that ill be babysitting if our mother ( soon to be Gran) can’t, when im not working.. I was “err ok then”

We found out its going to be a Girl which of course all happy about, I am such a bow girly girl in some cases that I went out bought the little one some bows for her when she gets to 3-4 years old IF she wants to wear one (cheap version of Jojo bows) .. but my sis is DEAD against that idea, she doesn't want her daughter to dress up in anything I LOVE and bows out of the question.. 

I explained, well if you want me to baby sit can’t I just dress her just for the day?……NOPE shes practically screaming at this point NO bows no fairy/mermaid dresses NOTHING because that means shell be just like her auntie and doesn't want that ( I love fantasy creatures)

I told her that hurts I cant have kids so I wont be able to experience anything like this formyself , would be nice just have a girly day with my future niece, im not trying to be a parent its just have fun.. 

Yeah she does not care its her word is final,

So I said ok then fine, I will not be baby sitting, do no expect me to go out my way to change nappies (diapers), clothe or bathe her I will not be responsible for her, you will just need take her with you to do errands etc and I walked away..

My mother thinks I been unreasonable because shes a new mum and I need to let it go and just sneak it while shes at work or whatever, but I feel she being to petty for petty reasons, not legit ones

So folks would I be A hole?

Now, several months back I bought tickets to go to a music concert, which was several hundred dollars, and I've been looking forward to until 3 days ago. My sister apologized to me because she knew I wanted to go but because of the funeral, I wouldn't be able to.

Now, up til this point I didn't say anything about the concert, and was sincere about her daughter, but I didn't think she'd assume I was coming.

I didn't have a close relationship with my niece, and I didn't consider her immediate family, and while I am upset and saddened that she passed, I didn't feel obligated to attend the (edit) funeral. They live 8 hours away as well and even if I drove at 4am, I wouldn't arrive until after they've almost entirely completed the ceremony.

Would I be the asshole if I went to the concert?",False,False
0,"AITA For Supposedly Excluding My Friend's Wife | A friend and wife visited for a weekend. They come into town on a Friday with their two dogs, I insisted they bring the dogs so they didn't have to board. I have plenty of room to accommodate. Dogs were friendly, however would be bark/whine if left alone.

Saturday morning: my friend is already awake, hanging out on the couch. Make breakfast together for everyone. Everything is great.

Hang out all day, go hiking, midafternoon friend's wife gets a headache. Get her coffee and snacks and she rests in their room for hours. I prepare dinner by myself. We all eat and have good conversation. My wife attempts to put our 2 y/o to bed. Around this time we stable our dogs. Ask my friend to come with me in the dark to put them in the barn. I assumed his wife would want to stay as she had the headache earlier and their dogs would bark/whine if we left them alone. Come back to the house, ask friend if he wants to eat more, get a snack together for everyone.

Next morning friend wants to treat us for breakfast. Breakfast place has a special monkey bread on Sundays: cinnamon or Nutella. Ask friend which he would like and order that. He and I eat the majority, his wife didn't touch it. Head back home, they get their things together and head home. Seemingly great weekend.

Monday afternoon: I am going to be near him next weekend for work. Text him to get dinner Friday night and hang out Saturday morning. He replies he is going to check with wife.

Monday evening: Friend texts me wants to chat. Call him, I can tell something is wrong, his tone is somber. Friend goes on to ask if I purposefully was excluding his wife from things during the weekend. I am shocked, flabbergasted, and offended as I spent quite a bit of time and energy preparing for and taking care of their needs while they were with my family. I assure him that I was not excluding her. He cites the three examples narrated above: the trip to the barn, the late-night snack, and the Nutella monkey bread. He goes on to say that he had observed my behavior and wanted to be assured that I not exclude his wife. I defend myself and apologize repeatedly, no change is had in his demeanor. At this point I assume his wife is directing him to have this conversation with me. I am not buying that he observed this and with no pressure from her initiated the phone call. He goes on to state that he naturally includes everyone, and would not have acted like I did. Conversation goes on for longer then needed and is of course uncomfortable at the close. He does thank me for the weekend and assures me his wife really enjoyed her time with my wife. Also shares that he and his wife cannot get dinner on Friday or hangout Saturday morning. We haven't spoken since then and I honestly don't know if I want to.

In my mind if he had perceived I was excluding her, he should have made an attempt to make me aware or he himself could have included her by sharing the invitation.",False,False
1,"AITA for getting angry when my friend insisted on talking about my relationship? | My relationship with my boyfriend has been going through a difficult stage for the past few weeks, and whenever I need someone to talk to about it, I almost always talk with my friend Camila. My boyfriend has made a couple of noteworthy mistakes in our relationship, but I still feel like we both genuinely care about each other, the good in our relationship far outweighs the bad, and we genuinely have a chance of working through our issues through communication and understanding. My friend, on the other hand, is suspect of everything my boyfriend does, and insists that I should ""punish"" him whenever he does something wrong. I've listened to my friend express her opinion about the topic, but it got to the point where her negativity became really excessive, and I told her I didn't want to talk about it anymore. 

Instead of listening to me, she decided to double down by telling me ""y'know, I honestly think you should just leave him. You can do way better!"" I got angry with my friend, and left her house. Later on, she called me, and we discussed what happened. I told her that I feel like she should be respectful about when I don't want to talk about my *own* personal life. She said that I owe it to her to hear her out when she has a new point to make (suggesting I leave him), because she has been there for me and listened to me for hours.

1,"AITA For choosing my friend over my boyfriend? | So, this happened some months ago and recently i talked with a friend about this who considered me an asshole for this but i really feel i'm not.

&#x200B;

Last year, i participated in a student exchange program and went 10 000Km away with 3 friends of mine and my boyfriend and i were dating for 3 months. So, my group of friends used to joke about me and one guy(wel'll call him T) in my group saying we would be hooking up during this period, but it was all jokes and of course nothing happened. My boyfriend did not enjoy hearing these jokes, but i made my best to assure him everything was going to be ok. It was all jokes to make fun of me and stuff like that, just the way they are. My boyfriend and i trust each other completely and it was not a big issue. During our time abroad me and T faced some challenges and were the ones in the same university, so we did a lot of stuff together and got really close friends.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend started working during that time and actually, together with some savings, managed to purchase tickets to come visit me during that time which i thought was awesome but here comes the key issue. His visit would be during a period of time where me and T(since the other 2 were still in classes) would be traveling, and T initially didn't want to come with us(did no want to intrude) but i thought it was nonsense so i finally convinced him to come. We wanted to to a place in the north(while my boyfriend was with us) and then go from there far up north to visit some friends(that came to the same continent) which meant my boyfriend would have to leave a day earlier(from the 7 days there) to catch a return flight back home. This made my boyfriend upset because he would waste basically 2 days from this trip there on flights where we were supposed to be together but couldn't now. I talked about this with T but he insisted on going there still and suggested i go south with my boyfriend so when i go north again we could just split in between and would get the most of our time together. However, this would mean that T would be alone for 7 days and i didn't want to be that friend who abandons her friends for a boyfriend.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend sad i had to choose and i got conflicted and didn't choose anything. He said he felt hurt because i wouldn't choose him over T and i said some friendships to me are more important than my boyfriend. I don't necessarily mean it now, but back then we were dating for only 3 months so... 

Eventually he said we could go north all three of us but we ended up going south since T agreed when he understood my boyfriend's case.

1,"AITA for changing my will? |     I(71M) am a modestly a really wealthy man. I am now suffering from kidney failure. I have extensively looked for a donor but have not found one. In my will, I dictated that my children will receive my assets. But certain events have happened that caused me to reconsider my will.
    When I was younger, I worked hard to make it to where I am now. This caused me to have a larger than life ego. I married and had one boy and then another girl. As the children grew up, I held them to unreachable standards. I restricted their access to any social activity and anything else that I considered a distraction.  My wife saw this and was horrified. She told me to change my ways. I refused and this lead to a bitter divorce. My children were 17 and 15 at that time. I blamed my children for this and refused to see them anymore. 
I turned into a very heartbroken man. This caused me to dive into work to avoid all this pain. In turn, I became very successful. As time went on, I realized how horrible and abusive I had been. I decided to reach out to my children and try to mend our relationships. 
They saw how I had changed and decided to forgive me for what I had done. I thought we had good relations now. As my time was coming to an end, my children decided to meet for a few last times. During one of these meetings, I had to excuse myself to the bathroom. As I was walking back, I heard them talking about me. I decided to listen to what they were saying. I was shocked to hear that my daughter saying that she was capable of donating her kidney to me. She had chosen not to donate to me as she wanted me to die and get all my assets sooner. My son only agreed with her. I immediately burst into the room and told them to get out. It seemed to me they had only started a relationship with me so they could receive my money. I decided to change my will so charities would be able to receive it instead. I thought they didn’t deserve it anymore. After they had left, I was getting tons of texts from them about how their actions were justified because of how much of an abusive father I had been. I felt bad but still did not consider this enough to change my mind.

1,"AITA for not giving (delaying) a gift for girlfriends birthday |  Hello,

So her birthday is on April 15th. Obviously malls and shops are closed and getting anything interesting was much more difficult.

Obviously, I could have done something myself, but my manual skills are poor, I can't draw... and getting materials is well, much more difficult cause of the lockup.

I could have also ordered something nice online, but I really don't like doing it. I barely buy things online, mostly when Im forced to. It just feels off for me to buy something without seeing it with my own eyes, checking it out first. I have a history of buying things online and regreting soon after, because they weren't a good fit after all or looked better on pictures. Besides, I am just so used to buying things in traditional shops I didn't really consider buying anything online that much.

So there I was, giftless, on April 13th, and I knew I won't have anything good enough for her on time. We were spending that day together and in the late evening I've asked if she'll be cool with me giving her a birthday gift later than on her actual birthday.

She was a little grumpy at first but she agreed.

On my way to her place the day of her bday, along with buying stuff she wanted me to get because she forgot, I've bought her her favorite flowers, her favorite sweets and pack of chocolates, because after all I really didn't want to come empty handed, and have at least something for her to give that day.

The next day she chatted me up. She was mad after all.

She found it incredibly unthoughful of me not to get her anything. She made comparissons to how on my birthday she put all this effort, got me a cake, came earlier to decorate the venue I made reservation in and gave me quite a big gift (bought together with some friends). She feels neglected and uncared for, and is incredibly sad that I wouldn't make an effort to get her something online earlier or even make something by myself. The argument went for literal hours, I apologised, promissed to put in more effort next time and made it really clear that Im just sorry I didn't meet her expectations. But she just couldn't stop giving me crap.

She didn't care that shops are locked and buying things online really isn't my thing, that I asked her if she's ok with getting something later and she said she was, that after all I did get her her favorite flowers, sweets and chocolates. And I that really ment it when I said I want to get her something later.

Nothing could make her feel less devastated and uncared for, none of the above, not repeated apologies. She made comments about how other men are capable of planning in advance, she is capable of planning in advance and she simply thinks that I don't care about her enough to make plans properly.

I find this hurtful and not true at all tho. In my opinion I have a right to give her something later than the actual date, especially since I've asked 2 days before and she said it she'd live with it, ESPECIALLY given the lockup situation.

1,"AITA for being angry about a joke my boyfriend made? | Last week, my boyfriend and me went to a bar with a few people from our university. This was the first time we spent time with these people. There were 5 women and 3 men and the two of us. We were playing some games and one guy said: ""the boys here have to drink one drink for every hot  woman sitting at this table!"" 

My boyfriend drank one drink and said to me: ""I'm not allowed to drink more than one anyway, right?"" and laughed. 

He insists that this was a joke and he wanted to be funny but I didn't find it funny at all. For me, this means that he finds those other women hot and I'm not okay with this. He said he didn't think about it before making the joke and apologized.

I hadn’t gone to church with them since Christmas so I agreed to go today. My mom, dad, me and my sister went. I hurt my knee doing leg press at the gym a few days back, and my doctor told me to rest Background: I’m not religious but my family is. I hadn’t gone to church with them since Christmas so I agreed to go today. My mom, dad, me and my sister went. I hurt my knee doing like press at the gym a few days back, and my doctor told me to rest my leg whenever I could. 


As we were walking in the usher asked us to take up the gifts (This means to bring up bread and wine to the alter halfway through mass, only takes about 5 min sometimes not even that)


I respectfully thanked him but declined and brought up my injury. As I was talking, my mom chimes in and said “The 3 of us can do it!” (Meaning my parents and sister) the usher thanked them. *It is worth noting my mom has terrible mental health and tends to use religion as a crutch for her anxiety*


Halfway through church my family left me to bring up the gifts. I was sitting all alone in an empty row: the front row of the section of seats we were in. I was hurt. My family chose their religion over me and none of them even thought about me. I was really hurt. They left me alone. Family is who I’m supposed to support and be able to fall back on if friends fuck me over. But now I feel like my family fucked me over and I only have my friends.


After church ended, I told my family that I felt ditched by their actions. My family got very defensive and started yelling at me. I lost my temper after a few minutes and eventually told my dad to fuck off and get some control in his relationship. (My mom was yelling at me and kept agreeing with her no questions asked. He always does this so in my head my nickname for him is “Little Spoon ____” My Dad is extremely passive and I don’t want to be like him when I have my own family)



Things kept escalating to the point where my sister started crying. (I feel guilt for this, I was much more mad at my parents then her.) Parents threatened to cancel my gym membership if I swear or argue at them again. 



It’s been a few hours since this died down but I don’t think im going to mass with them anytime soon...

We have always been close and my parents have always been supportive of most of what Will and I have chosen to do. They have never been vocal about lgbt things except passing comments like “Oh they are so cute together” and things like that. 

Well, Will came to visit me after school let out three days ago and in a flurry of tears said that he was gay and how I’m the only one who knows and that nothing will ever be the same and that he just wishes he could die so he wouldn’t have to “go through all of this.” I know that he is bullied at school a lot for being quiet so I’m sure this is what is on his mind about being gay and his classmates bullying him even more. 

Obviously I was super concerned when he told me this and since I live on the other side of the city, I offered him to stay at my place for the night. 

The whole night I didn’t sleep because I was worried about his safety. I got up a few times in the night and checked on him sleeping just to make sure he was okay. I spent all night tossing and turning and trying to decide what to do. 

The next morning I drove him to school and he didn’t say anything except for thanks for the ride and he made me promise not to tell anyone. 

I don’t think I can take on the responsibility of his safety alone. Least of all because I live on the other side of the city and I can’t be there for him most of the time. I think that the people that he lives with should be aware of what is going on so they can keep an eye of him and keep him safe. I know that they would accept him.

I told this person, “Mind your fucking business.” I know this wasn’t a very clever “comeback” but the other patron didn’t respond at all. I then left the bathroom. 

I told my friend who I went to the movies with about it and they said that the person didn’t deserve to be cursed at but I obviously wouldn’t have cursed at the person if they didn’t talk to me like I was a fucking 5 year old so I don’t think I did anything wrong.

We cannot divorce because the legal logistics would rattle shareholders in our company. Therefore, she agreed I could see others if I kept it away from the family.

I have been dating this woman for about a year. At first we were careful not to show PDA when we went out but over time she told me how much that hurts so we started being affectionate when we were out on dates.

A few months ago, somebody from my daughter’s school took a picture of me kissing my partner and posted it on social media. My daughter ended up throwing a tantrum because it was a topic at her school and she got a bunch of comments and questions.

I explained that it was an agreement that her mom and I had, and I deserve to be happy.

Things have just cooled down, but for my birthday yesterday, my partner ended up sending me a present and a note that said she loved and missed me. She also sent my daughter a card congratulating her on finishing middle school. 

My daughter started screaming at me that she wanted this woman out of our lives. My wife also got mad because my daughter was sad, claiming I wasn’t keeping it away from the family and that I let this present thing happen in front of my daughter’s best friend, who she invited over for cake. 

However, she forgets that I really wanted to spend time with my girlfriend for my birthday but I abandoned that desire for the sake of the family.

1,"AITA for reporting fraud | Throwaway

I'm an audiologist and I do work for the VA. I, personally, feel that hearing loss claims are ones that fraudsters erroneously select the most thinking they can just ignore the beeps and get some quick cash. 

This guy comes in with a claim for hearing loss. Now, to be clear, you don't need to be deaf to get money from the VA. You can have normal hearing that shows a decline over time and still get a rating. The guy is doing fine. Hearing is looking normal. Then we get to a point and he basically gets everything wrong. So I call bullshit and tell him that his hearing his normal, I know what he's doing and he needs to cut it out so we can finish the test. 

He apologizes, he does look a little nervous, but he says that the small space he's in for the test is triggering a panic attack and that;s why he jacked that part of the test. Guy was a submariner so I'm not buying his claustrophobia excuse.

I note in his record that I think he was being noncompliant with the test and potentially trying to manipulate the results. That's usually all it takes. This guy, however, within a few days of the test withdrew his claim. I suspect he withdrew his claim because I called him out rather than just making a note and he didn't want my accusation to turn into a fraud investigation. 

This kind of pissed me off. I'm tired of people trying to cheat the system. My BIL is a VA Special Agent so I called him to tip him off to this guy. He tells me that it isn't going to go anywhere because 1) the guy withdrew his claim and 2) proving he tanked his test, or tried to, would be somewhat difficult as his lawyer would almost certain argue he actually did have a panic attack since the rest of the test was perfectly normal participation. He suggested I just let it go.

I chose not to.

The guy is employed as a police officer. So I called the misconduct tip line for his department and basically laid out that he was trying to cheat a compensation exam. An investigator contacted me and thanked me for my tip and said they may need to subpoena some records if they find enough to warrant more investigation.

My BIL is telling me that I fucked up big and I shouldn't have done basically any of the things I've done aside from making the note in my report. From my standpoint, if more people stepped up and actually vigorously pursued fraudsters then there would be less fraud.

I’m 24, my spouse is 27, and the friend in question is 20. We’ll call her Abby.

I met Abby in class at college; then further talked to her when I was tutoring her for a class.

Abby is very needy. She constantly sends messages to myself and my spouse about her issues. Which is fine, 20 can be a shit age and we all had to go through it at some point. But it was to the point where my spouse had to mute her on Facebook because of the barrage of messages.

She was diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed medication to alleviate some of these issues. But it’s just not enough.

I wouldn’t mind supporting her when I could, but she doesn’t seem to remember anything that I or my spouse tells her about ourselves- simple things like ages, she forgot my spouse had a hearing problem and can’t drive, forgot that I was disowned from my family for being gay, things like that.

It really boils down to me feeling like she’s not invested in either friendship. And I normally wouldn’t have so much hesitation in cutting out someone, but we are her primary emotional supports and her family sucks.

0,"AITA for ‘undermining’ my boyfriends weight loss efforts in front of his family? | My boyfriend decided he wanted to lose some weight, and somehow got sucked into a dark hole of only drinking water. Apparently it’s completely safe but he is essentially living off his own fat reserves.

I think it’s deeply harmful and I am worrying about his health, in a month he has lost THIRTY lbs and it’s just ridiculous. He was 340 lbs before and now he’s 310.  I mean, I get that he wants to lose weight but in a month? I love him and I want him to be okay. 

He is bragging to his friends that he’s lost weight by fasting, etc. Privately I have spoken to him and told him let’s do this the healthy way, he needs to be accountable about this instead of starving himself, etc. I also think it’s unfair that he’s talking about this to his impressionable younger brother and sister when we went to visit.

His younger brother in particular seemed to be hanging on to every word my boyfriend said (his brother is 14) and I didn’t feel comfortable because he was asking about him doing it etc. My bf encouraged it and said he’d lose a good amount.

I mentioned that my boyfriend was not doing this with advice from his doctor and that it was healthier if he (my bf’s bro) just focused on speaking to his doc if he had any questions about losing weight. I also said  ‘bf is not going about this the right way’ which I felt appropriate because I have a close relationship with my bf and his family and felt I could speak freely. 

When we left my boyfriend was furious and said that I was undermining him, that I was making his efforts out to be dangerous etc.  I told him that I was proud he was losing weight but worried at his method, AND I said that telling a 14 y/o to just not eat is the last thing he needs to be doing.

0,"WIBTA for asking a girl to stop talking about her depression? | I've known this girl for 3 days and I basically already know her life story. TMI isn't a thing with her.

She has, without fail, in every single conversation I have ever had with her, slipped her depression into it. We talk about books and ""Oh, I can't read Orwell's stuff. It aggravates my depression and then I have to cry alone in my room for several hours"". We talk about history class and it's ""And I can never do my homework because I'll just sit there staring at the page thinking about how useless I am. Just repeating useless, useless, useless to myself like a mantra."" She walks up after class, sits down next to me, and the first thing out of her mouth is ""I missed the bus because I had a depressive episode in sixth period and my teacher wanted to talk about it. Have I told you that I was in therapy in seventh grade?""

I don't know how to respond half the time rather than the occasional ""Oh, that sucks"". I know what she wants me to say, of course. She wants me to say ""No, you're not useless"" then list stuff I like about her, or ""No, you're not a burden"" then proceed to to lie about why I don't mind wasting my lunch for her, or something along those lines, but I don't because I don't want to feed that kind of dependability. Does that make me an asshole? I obviously don't think she's useless, but I don't want her leaning on me like a crutch. I don't want to become her comfort object, there when she needs me, dropped when she doesn't.

I don't think it's really her fault. I think she just has a really hard time reading social cues. Her laugh, for example, feels incredibly forced and she tends to talk over others. She might also have several mental problems, and might be on the autism spectrum. 

My main problem is that she's essentially made me responsible for her emotional well-being and I don't want to be. I have nothing against people with depression. I have depression. I have a therapist. And maybe that makes me an even bigger hypocrite, but at least I don't go shoving my problems down strangers throats (other than on Reddit, obviously). And it'd be different if she only talked about it every once-in-awhile like my other depressed friends, but she doesn't. It's every single time she opens her mouth like her personality revolves around it or something.

She's miserable and has low self-esteem and I get that but at the same time I don't want her to make me responsible for her mental health. I have enough shit to deal with without her. I don't mind continuing the friendship, I just don't want to be responsible for making her happy.

I'm fairly certain that I'm her only friend. If I tell her she can't vent to me she probably won't have anyone else she can talk to. It might be being selfish and incredibly narcissistic by trying to get her to stop talking about her problems but I hate feeling responsible for her.

1,"AITA for refusing to change the dress I wore to my cousins wedding? | Yesterday, my cousin got married. She had a formal black tie dress code.
I wore this dress:

https://www.prettylittlething.us/silver-sequin-split-midi-dress.html?isSwatchLink=1

Before the church ceremony her mom and a couple of brides maids came up to me and asked me about my dress, and asked me if I would change so I didn’t make the bride uncomfortable. I said no, I didn’t see any reason that my dress would make her uncomfortable, and I didn’t have a dress to change into. I surely didn’t want to wear the potato sack that they had for me to change into. 
Between the ceremony and the reception, I was asked to change again, and I said no. I told them that if the bride wanted me to change, she could tell me.
The rest of the evening I heard comments about my dress, people saying I was trying to upstage the bride, but that wasn’t the case.

I don’t have a lot of nice clothes and don’t really want to buy anything new. The nicest outfit I own is a hand sewn replica of Margaery Tyrell’s dress from S2E3. It is gorgeous and to me looks more like a nice dress than something from a fantasy TV show. 

My sister said I would be a major asshole if I wore this dress since it would take attention away from our cousin. I told her at least I would be covered up and not flashing my tits everywhere like I know she’s going to. She called me a name, I called her one and that was that.

0,"AITA - Told classmates to ""buckle up"" then I was called a bully | I'm in a nursing program with 30 other students. We're pretty close and we group chat a lot. These classmates IMO have developed a complaining attitude about every assignment and request, even though our workload has significantly decreased since covid-19 came about. We just got a new assignment, which will take 1-3 hours due in 11 days. Many students immediately started complaining about how it was ""sprung"" on them and they are too overwhelmed to do it. 

I work 40 hrs/week and found that the assignment wouldn't be too hard to complete... So out of a little irritation, I said ""well as nurses we are going to have to be flexible and deal with things that spring up unexpectedly. Buckle up."" 

This wasn't taken well, and a fellow student expressed that people are stressed because of covid-19, and that they shouldn't let a ""bully who minimizes their struggle get them down. Some things that are small to some are large to others.""

0,"AITA for setting the date/location of our wedding without our families' input? | This is actually ""are we the asshole"", we being my fiance and me.

We got engaged June 2019, and decided to get married in June 2020. There was a certain band that we wanted to play at the wedding, for sentimental reasons, so our primary concern in setting the date was being able to book them without any scheduling conflict.

As for the location, we currently live in Queens, NY. My fiance is from Long Island and his family lives there, and my family is from/live in Vermont. The majority of our guests are coming from NYC. We chose a venue on Long Island partly because it was convenient for us, but mostly because we found a beautiful venue with an excellent wedding package that was in our budget.

A detail that I think is important: my fiance and I are paying for the entire wedding by ourselves, with no financial contribution whatsoever from either side of the family.

Since we informed our families of the details and sent Save The Dates, everyone has been attacking us for leaving them out of the planning. My family in particular has been complaining about having to travel for the wedding, with various members (my grandmother and dad in particular) saying that they might not be able to come because traveling is too much of a hassle. They've said I should've had the wedding in Vermont to accommodate them, instead of in New York. My fiance's family is less upset about the venue, but his mom started a literal screaming match when we told her that we'd set a date because ""you don't make a wedding without consulting the family"".

We really feel like both sides are being selfish and unsupportive, but I'm wondering if we were the initial assholes for making independent decisions? It's really hard to navigate wedding culture, everyone seems to be so touchy and opinionated about everything and it's hard to figure out what the ""correct"" thing to do is. Did we fuck up? Are we assholes?",False,False

A few days later I noticed that he followed her on Instagram and she was popping up on his phone quite frequently.

This morning things came to a head and I asked him to unfollow her. He responded by unfollowing her and then deleting his Instagram account because he ""might as well"" since it ""obviously creates problems."" This is not the first time we've had an issue with him pushing boundaries with other women (for example, he let his ex stay at his house for a few weeks and lied to me about it) but it is the first time I've asked him to delete or block anyone, so I don't THINK I'm being unreasonable, but I don't know how to judge at this point.

1,"AITA for alerting family of my brothers’ crap and telling my brother he’s no longer welcome to family events or my life | Long story short my oldest brother has a sixteen year old son who has a mental disorder preventing him from communicating, having a conscious, and eating regular food. He has a feeding tube and overall is just a sweet eighty pound kid who doesn't have a single evil bone in his body. My brother also has a 14, 12, and 9-year-old. 

The entire family loves this sixteen-year-old boy and hell climb into your lap and giggle and just have a good time. He is literary like a baby minus the crying. I’ve also watched him daily years ago and not sure where my brothers concerns are. My brother, whose also kind of entitled didn’t give me a dime for driving 10 miles Monday-Thursday (watched him all day Friday and Saturday)

My brother relayed that he’s worried about one of his other kids hurting the sixteen year old as the other three have anger issues and know how to manipulate to get others in trouble. Plus he didn’t want to change pullups for the rest of his life and that he doesn’t want to take care of thirty six year old down the road, so him and his (new) wife are thinking about putting him into a group home.

Normally this would be fine, but I know my brother. He never made time for his sisters, his brothers, or myself growing up. Each single person came last…and I get it that he was in his twenties and thirties at the time, but it doesn’t take much effort to even say hi. My sisters and brothers know him… this innocent baby boy will be forgotten and won’t have a father or mother anymore (mother also didn’t want him several years ago)

1,"WIBTA if I declined to meet the new guy my mom has started dating (less than a year after my dad died) because he's a felon? | I'm a 27-year-old guy.  My parents had been happily married for 25-30 years when my dad died on June 20, 2018.  At some point this past spring, my mom (52) started dating a guy (37) from work.  She talks about him a lot, and while things seem to be moving surprisingly quickly between them, it's not my place to say what she can and can't do with her life, and ultimately I want her to be happy.

Several weeks ago she mentioned to him that I enjoy target shooting as a hobby.  Apparently he immediately went out and bought a gun despite having no prior experience with firearms.  I thought this was a little weird, but whatever, everyone has to start somewhere.

However, last week my mom told me that he introduced her to marijuana, which is still illegal for recreational use in our state.  She said that they ""only"" use it about three times per week, which seems like a lot to me, but again, it's not really any of my business.  The problem is that I've purchased enough guns to know that the following question appears on the form when you buy one:

> Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?

Lying on this form is a felony, and as a lawful gun owner with a license to carry, it bothers me that he committed a crime like this, even though it's unlikely that the police will ever find out about it.  And not only did he break the law while buying the gun, but he's also continuing to break the law simply by possessing it per the ATF:

> Therefore, any person who uses or is addicted to marijuana, regardless of whether his or her State has passed legislation authorizing marijuana use for medicinal purposes, is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance, and is prohibited by Federal law from possessing firearms or ammunition.

My mom has been asking me to meet him.  My younger brother immediately refused because he doesn't want to see my mom with anyone other than my dad, and I could tell that she was upset by that.  I don't particularly want to be friends with this guy either, but I was planning to suck it up and do it for her because I love my mom and treasure my relationship with her.  But after she told me about the marijuana, I just don't know if I can respect him as a person.

**I want to be crystal clear that I have nothing against recreational marijuana use in and of itself.**  In fact, I wish the government would hurry up and legalize it at the federal level so I can start using it occasionally too.  What bothers me is that he committed a felony by lying on his 4473, and it's hard to see my mom with a criminal (regardless of whether he's been charged), let alone welcome him into my life.

0,"AITA for cutting in line? | Today I went to the store to buy some lunch. After getting everything I need I walk over to the check-out and join the queue. There is one man in front with me with me, his items are getting scanned by the cashier. There is also a basket with some groceries on the floor in front of me. I assume they are from the man in front of me. 

A few seconds later another man walks over to the basket and starts placing the items on the checkout band. When he is done he leaves again to get some more groceries. The man in front of me just handed over the money to the cashier so I decide to cut in line and put my 2 items in front of the items of the man that is still shopping, thought it was weird that other people should wait when it's his turn while he is still shopping. 

The checkout process of the man in front of us takes a bit longer because he is paying €200 in cash with bills of €10 so they all had to be checked if they were real. During this process the man that was still shopping came back and started a discussion with me because I was cutting in line when he was gone.  I tried to explain to him how a store works and that he should first grab everything he needs and then join the queue.

1,"AITA for finding my mom yelling at the cleaning ladies kind of funny? | My parents hire a group of three cleaning ladies to clean our house bi-monthly. For a while now, my mom has been complaining about how the quality has gone down. Basically, she said they did well at first, but since my parents have been hiring them for 3 years, the quality has slipped. My mom also says our family is overpaying (a few other families in the neighborhood hire the same cleaning ladies, and we're paying more than they are).

The thing is, my mom's a very timid person. She always tells the ladies to clean well and points out specific things they could be doing better, but they basically ignore her. For example, she wants them to clean up the sinks and all that well, but they don't. And my mom is too shy to tell them again or be authoritative, so she doesn't reprimand them or anything for ignoring her.

However, my mom also has a habit of occasionally getting angry and giving lectutes.

So, yesterday, the cleaning ladies came, and as usual, a lot of stuff wasn't done that well. My mom had finally 'had it', so to speak, so she pointed out all the stuff that wasnt cleaned properly and demanded it be cleaned. They insisted it had already been cleaned properly and that she shouldn't 'talk to them that way', and this devolved into a shouting match which ended in them quitting and telling her not to call them again.

I found the whole thing very funny, if only for the absurdity of the situation. For one thing, it's really funny how my mom has been timid and has let them do whatever they wanted for 3 years, and suddenly blowing up at them, as opposed to establishing authority from the beginning. 

My parents are both mad at me for finding it funny. My dad, on one hand, says yelling at someone you hired is no laughing matter, and my mom should apologize. My mom says I should've supported her more, because they weren't doing well.

I disagree with both. My mom has the right to tell them that they're not doing well if they aren't. But she also made the wrong move in letting them ignore her orders for 3 years and now suddenly insisting they do things properly. That's just not how it works: if you don't act authoritatively, people will slack off.

Well, when my SIL got home, she made the kids lunch and didn't say anything about the now clean Kitchen. She asked how I was, and what I did today, and I  said  ""oh nothing really, just did a bit of cleaning"" 

She said ""oh a little bored then?"" And asked if I wanted to help my Nephew with one of his toys.

I said "" no not bored, just thought I would clean up the kitchen a bit"" 

She looked around and just said ""huh"" and then proceeded to keep talking about my Nephews toy that he wanted to build with me. 

I got a little annoyed at that, and as she was cleaning up Lunch, I just said ""your kids go through a lot of dishes"" 

She gave me a weird look, and asked what I was looking for. I said a ""Thank you"" would be nice. 

She kinda smiled and asked what for, I said for cleaning up, she then asked me if I say Thank you to her when she does dishes, or cleans the bathroom,  cooks, or vacuums ect.

So I'm a 37M, widowed of 1 and a half years. Me and my wife had a beautiful daughter (AJ) who turned 17 eariler on this year. We decided to not have any more children after her. My wife passed away and it affected me and AJ enormously. I still am not over it, but staying strong for kiddo is all i can do. One of the ways i help her cope is buy her everything she asks for, and give her lots of extras on top.

Please don't get the wrong idea, AJ isn't spoilt, like asking for TVs/Cars/Consoles/Makeup/Clothes every five seconds. But if she asks if i can give her a tenner for a girls coffee shop ill hand it over or if we're out shopping at the supermarket i let her put whatever she likes in the trolley. I let her every month use my credit card to go on a shopping spree online (sounds worse than it is, she never goes above £100). If we go into town and see a pair of Nike's that she likes ill get them for her no problem. This again, isn't often, less than once every 3 months if that.  Birthdays/Christmas i do go wild. Got her a crazy good PC earlier this year (<£1500) and plan on getting her a car for a belated Christmas present when she gets her license (probably around £10k). I pay for her driving lessons, private tuition (she has a part scholarship, super proud moment!!) etc. She has money but id say 80% of it gets saved.

My wife had a decent amount of savings, and i also have a decent job so financially none of this bothers me. I mainly do this because we can afford to, and it makes AJ happy. After losing my wife, seeing AJ happy is all i want in my life.

So onto the AITA part. My parents sat me down yesterday, telling me i needed to calm down spending so much on AJ (told them about the car and PC prior). They said it was impractical and i'm not teaching her about saving money or rewarding herself for hard work. I told them she's a solid A student and has a lot of prospect of going to university (where she will be managing a lot by herself anyway), and i want to make her as happy as possible in the time i have with her. Dad then said 'She's gone David, it doesn't mean AJ will be going as soon'. Well i snapped at that point and told them to get stuffed, i'm giving her a childhood i didn't have (parents were poor when i was young, and it was a ill judged comment looking back) and a childhood me and my passed wife would have wanted for her.

Our backyard fence is shared with a series of townhomes that are behind our house. The townhome directly behind my home has a balcony that is raised over my fence. So everything that is going on on that balcony can be seen from my backyard. 

Yesterday, my kids were playing in the backyard enjoying the nice weather. I’m not really sure who lives in that townhome behind us, but there is a young man (probably early 20s) that occasionally goes out on the porch to smoke pot. I know because I’ve smelled it before when I’ve let the dog out.

Me, my sister and the bride-to-be's sister had all thought of the idea to have a surprise hens and go to Bali. We would split the cost 3 ways and make it our last holiday together, a last harrah before she leaves us for married life. We knew everything would add up in terms of money wise, but it was for our best friend, a once in a lifetime occasion, money isn't an issue. We had our eyes on the lingerie we were going to get her, the kitchen tea presents, engagement and of course the wedding present.

The part that really got me though, was her saying she ""still wants us to be apart of it all"" to me this sounds like use and abuse? We can throw a bridal shower, a kitchen tea, the best hens night, but why should we go above and beyond now?

I live in a house with 4 other friends from college, we've been living together for over 2 years and have all been friends for longer. We all have a mutual friend (I'll call him John) that we've all known throughout college and post-grad.

Luckily he wasn't home that day when the invitations came, because one I realized there was only 4, I kinda felt bad for him.

I'd consider John and Mike friends, but nothing more than just hanging out in the same group together. I can probably count on one hand the amount of individual conversations they've had, and the only time they really see each other is when I invite John over when he's in town, so I wasn't surprised that Mike didn't get the invite. My other 3 roommates and myself keep in touch with John pretty regularly (he moved out of state after graduation) and always try to hang out whenever possible, so we were pretty excited for our friend and his soon-to-be wife.

The issue is that Mike is aware of the wedding (pretty sure he's under the impression he'll be getting an invite any day now), and the wedding is local to us. It's been a little under a month since we got them in the mail, but none of us have mentioned it to Mike yet since we don't want to bum him out. Mike doesn't really do a lot without at least one of us, and our house is pretty tight knit; We're going to feel bad leaving him behind that day but it's out of our control.

WI(we)BTA if we waited til closer to the wedding date to tell him that we all got invites and are going without him? Or should we just rip the bandaid off now? I'm just kinda worried that if we told him now, months in advance, it'll bother him deep down no matter how hard he tries to hide it",False,False
1,"AITA for not wanting to see my friends baby? | So I and some of my friends meet bi-monthly for a D&D campaign. It's only 4 of us, and we rotate houses each session.  Well one of my friends is having a baby, and he's starting to say that once it arrives, we're going to have to use his place more often so he can be there for the baby and his wife. (Weird to me, but everyone else seems ok with it) 

They're also insisting that everyone who wants to see the baby has to get a flu and TDAP shot beforehand. And since we'll be playing at his house we're included in this.

So here's the shocking twist: I don't want to do any of that. At this point I'm perfectly fine in not having contact with him or his child for the 6+ months they stated. I don't want to endanger the child, but I also dont necessarily feel that everyone should have to work around his kid for the next 6 months for what will likely amount to <12 sessions total.  So AITA here or is he?",False,False
0,"WIBTA to tell my mother she can’t watch my kid 100% of the time? | This is such a first world problem, but is already causing issues and we’re a few weeks into this pregnancy journey. 

My mother (58) lives with my partner and I. She pays her own bills, the groceries and dinners out in lieu of rent. (She a widow living off a small pension & a keep her busy part time job). 

My partners mother (64) is fully retired and lives twenty minutes from us. She spends half her week watching her grand sons (3&7) and the rest doing “me time”. 

We’re due in July, and I will be returning to work sometime in September. My mom has told me she’s going to quit her job to watch the baby. That’s great! Daycare is expensive and we appreciate it. 

Problem is, my partners mother would also like to watch the bub as well during the week. We’ve both assured our mothers they’re going to get time with the baby, blah blah. 

Partners mother is claiming because my mother lives with us, she shouldn’t be allowed to “hog” baby. My mother says it’s just logical, and would make her feel more useful around the house. My mother also argues that partners mother has her other grandchildren three days a week, and her other grandchildren live hours away. 

So I want to go all Solomon on them both and set a schedule, such as my mom M-W(when partners mom has her much older grand children) and then partners mom T-F + date nights. 

My sister is calling me TA because my mom lives with us, why shouldn’t she watch him 5 days a week?

1,"AITA for wanting my ex/father of my unborn child to move in with me (7mth pregnant) but not allow his new gf to do the same? | So yeah I’m 7 months pregnant and things are getting difficult for me. I had a very difficult pregnancy until now and I’ve got a lot of anxiety over the actual birth. 

My ex-boyfriend and I had broken up before I found out I was pregnant. However when I told him he said he was very committed to being there for me and the baby and promised to do everything he can for me. 

The issue is we live in a city where I have literally 0 family or close friends nearby. Recently I confessed to my ex that I’ve been feeling incredibly alone and scared and basic tasks are getting harder to do as I get larger. Since I live in a bigger house by myself (3 bedrooms) I asked him if he’d want to move in with me just until the baby’s born. He was really supportive of this idea and wanted to be there for me, like just being a nice presence whether if it’s cooking or just rubbing my feet after a long day. 

BUT the part that is making me feel like TA is him asking if his gf could move in too? They’ve been dating the entirety of my pregnancy and she has been the opposite of supportive, often making up excuses to bar him from seeing me. My ex said that he could rent a house on my street (long term Airbnb) and live there with his gf instead of staying with me. He says this way he could be over and still live with his gf? I feel like he could bear to live apart from her for the next few weeks just for his own flesh and blood child...

I got really upset at this because I 1000% do not want his rude gf around, even on my street. It completely defeats the purpose of him being there for me if she’s judging my every move. AITA for telling him his gf can’t move in down the street even though I still want him to move in with me?",False,False
1,"WIBTA for asking the nanny I fired to give back gas money reimbursement? | I recently moved back in with the father of my child after 4 years overseas pursuing an interesting opportunity. 

We had our child five years ago but I made it clear that I didn’t want him to propose just because we had a child in common. I still wanted to meet other guys, travel everywhere, and experience all the things someone in her twenties gets to experience.

However, I always made sure to show up to his birthday parties and never did destructive stuff like try to get my son to meet a boyfriend of mine. 

What I found out after moving in was that my son had a full time nanny. I was told details of her employment such as how much she was getting reimbursed for gas, her hours, responsibilities, etc. 

The father of my child is a pushover in terms of negotiations and I personally felt that we could have had much less expensive childcare that would have still done much more than what the nanny he hired did. But I let it go. 

However, today I got a box of bagels delivered from a local place and put the box inside the pantry. I accidentally fall asleep while browsing stuff in the next room but when I walk back in I see the nanny eating straight out if the box. The delivery man had even had my name on the box. 

So I tell her to leave the house. She starts talking to me in that annoying way where all your statements sound like there’s a question mark at the end of it and saying that she has cared for the child for most of its life. (??) 

My son’s father comes in and when I ask him if he let her eat food he bought for the family he says he never said that was a part of her compensation but sometimes he sees her eating. He never really kept track of the food in the house. 

Finally the nanny left our house. My son’s father said that he’s ok with finding a new nanny since I’d be doing more in terms of household than he was and he wanted me to get along with whoever was here.

I have a log of the gas money she uses per week to run errands for the household and I said I wanted to call and demand that she give back what she was already paid as reimbursement for the expected use of her car next week. 

My child’s father says that I should let it go because he only gave her slightly over 20 bucks.

However, I feel like 20 bucks is way too much to just give away for free. 

It would be different if she was let go because we found another caregiver. However, she screwed this up herself and to top it off was questioning my status as the BIOLOGICAL parent. 

This thing is ticking me off and I feel like every time I think about putting in an order online for something my mind goes back to what those twenty dollars could rightfully be going towards. 

I just feel like this is a time for me to step up and make sure I’m doing everything for the benefit of us.",False,False
0,"AITA for telling my mom to stop backseat driving? | My mom doesn’t drive so I often drive her around. She has never driven in her life. But whenever she’s in the car, she always backseat drive and starts freaking out if she thinks I’m doing something wrong. This can be very distracting to some, and to me, it is.

For example, I was picking her up late at night from work. There was a car in front of us and before I could stop, she starts yelling, “There’s a car in front of us!!”. This made me jerk and I pressed the brake hard even though I knew the car was in front.  I yelled at her and said, “don’t yell and distract me like that”. She got mad at me and said she doesn’t want me to pick her up anymore because I said that in front of her friend/coworker.

My dad found out about this, and said I was being disrespectful to my mom by saying that in front of her friend/coworker. Am I the asshole for yelling at her like that?

Note: this isn’t the first time I’ve told her to stop back seat driving. I’ve already spoken to her about it many times since it’s very distracting when I’m being told how to drive.",False,False

1,"WIBTA if I told my ex-husband that he can't have his love interest(s) come over to the house that WE currently own? | Here's the long and short:

SO and I met in highschool. Were together for 10 years, married for 5 of those 10. No kids. We purchased a home during said marriage. He and I both work, always kept our finances separate, and split all expenses down the middle. His best friend has rented a room in our house since the home was purchased and best friend pays rent each month, albeit a very low amount of rent. But if you work for the tax man, that last sentence is not true and idk what you're talking about.

Fast forward to the marriage breakdown-- We couldn't work out our differences. My lawyer said this is the least contentious separation she has had in a while. We managed to all live under the same roof for 5 months while we prepped the house to sell it. I didn't want share space with him and his bestie anymore so I opted to rent a room from an internet stranger. I still come and go unannounced to grab stuff.

So, we're both rational beings... until... he texted me while I was at work asking if he could bring a love interest to the house. I'm pissed/ticked/angry/furious and have yet to respond bc I can't conjure a kind response. Most of my friends suggest I am overreacting.

I have been dating and I am glad to hear he is too. We will always be a big part of each other's history. I just can't fathom how he could even ask if he can Netflix and chill using the account his ex-wife pays for in the house his ex-wife still pays (essentially half) for.

So as I sat there I felt compelled to test it out to see if he would react to loud annoying sounds to see if he was legit. So I started with loud throat clearing and worked my way up to some bizarre yelping noises from one side of my mouth. Looked like he didn't notice anything.

The radio was off (not surprising) so I thought hey why not put on some tunes? Even if I put on something most people think is awful I can get away with it. How can you refuse that kind of opportunity. I cranked it up and let the tunes belt out of my phone.

0,"AITA for making my uncle's fiancee seem fat in front of family and friends? (Repost: word count) | The backstory involves my uncle's fiancee (now wife) Annie and myself going shopping. Annie is around 5'7"" and slender and in her 40's, and I'm 5' and 125lbs and in my mid 20's. I'm short and fat on a small frame, so I'm big-chested and have a small waist with a fat belly. I know I'm fat and my family usually makes fun of me for being fat. It doesn't make me happy, but I've never done or said anything to be rude to anyone who's skinnier than I am, at least not on purpose. 

While shopping, Annie sees a top from a brand I like. She asks me, ""hey, does this look good on me?"" while holding it up to her body, and I tell her yes. She says, ""I wonder what size I should get. What size do you wear?"" and I respond, ""Oh, I wear a medium from this brand."" She looks at me and says with a laugh, ""oh come on, there's no way you're a medium. You're a large. I'm getting this in medium."" I suggest, ""you should try it on first,"" and she brushes me off and says, ""no, it'll be fine. I'm sure I'm a medium because you're definitely a large."" I don't press her further, even though I know she's got a bigger frame than me AND I already have the exact same shirt in medium; she beelines for the cashier, pays, and we move on.

A week later, at a family dinner where Uncle Eddy and his daughter and some family friends come over, Annie brings the top she bought and gives it to me. She said it was too small and didn't fit, and that Eddy's daughter doesn't like it so she's giving them to me. I receive it, go to my room, grabbed the one I already had, brought it back out, and showed her it's the exact same top in the same size. I didn't really do this to be rude, but I was trying to prove a point that she should have tried it on instead of being hasty. The other guests were hanging out in the living room and saw this, and Annie looked really embarrassed to be seen as ""bigger"" than me. Even worse, the weekend following this, I was invited to lunch by my parents; I ended up wearing the same top and Annie and everyone else ended up being there. It's a v-neck and looked flattering for me because I'm big-chested, but Annie is slender and small-chested, so it almost seemed like I was openly trying to one-up her. Since then I've avoided wearing that shirt, but I've also not seen Annie very much.

Tl;dr - uncle's tall and slender fiancee bought a shirt after asking short and fatty me what size I wear, I say I'm a medium but she insists I must be a large so she should be medium and refuses to try on the shirt before buying it in medium, only to end up with the shirt being too small for her and having to give it to me. I have the exact same shirt and pulled it out when she gave me hers in front of a gathering at my house, she looked embarrassed, and the weekend after I wore the same shirt and ended up accidentally seeming like I'm trying to one-up her.

1,"WIBTA for reporting a fast food manager? | My husband and I frequent this fast food sandwich restaurant. Let's call it New York Jeff's. I actually used to be an employee, so I knew the ins and outs. When they are busy, I take the ticket and write out the order for them. I've done this at least 30 times and have never had an issue, in fact, most of staff thank me for making it easier. 

Cut to today - my husband and I go and they are swamped. I grab the ticket as normal and write down my order. Then comes Condescending Lady (CL). She sees what I've done and says with the most condescending voice ""umm actually, we write out the tickets because we have a specific way that we do things. Alright? Thanks."" I was already off put by that, but then she proceeds to rewrite the ticket and [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/5EUrKmb) is the difference. Basically nothing. 

It put a sour taste in my mouth, but I let it go. I tell the cashier to charge me for the extra bacon I added, but not for the extra cheese since I took the cheese off the other sandwich. Once again, this is 100% above board and I know this. He said sure and cashed me out.

CL comes back over and asked if he charged me for the cheese. He says no, I step in to say how I basically swapped the cheese to the other sandwich, and she replies ""well you have to let me know so I can communicate that to the grill."" Now, that's BS. The grill already has the order marked for extra cheese, why does he care that I'm not getting charged for it? I tell CL that next time I'll tell the manager that, and she says ""I am the manager"" 

Now here's where I did get a bit sassy. I replied ""manager? WOW."" And then asked ""are you like the real manager, or the shift manager?"" 

With her scrunched up face, she says ""the real manager."" I say okay and let it be. I stood and watched as the hot sub was being made, and noticed they didn't put the extra meat party. When onions and peppers are removed, extra meat is added. I point it out to her asap so they can fix it before finishing the sub, and she says ""we don't add the meat if you add extras, and you added bacon."" 

I say ""so what you're saying is, I paid $1.75 to add bacon so I don't get the meat, but had I not paid anything, I would have gotten the meat for free?"" 

She then asks me in such a condescending manner ""umm, did you used to work here?"" And I inform her that yes, I did. She asks what I do now. I ALMOST say ""I have a real job,"" but I really didn't want to be rude, so I said ""I have a new job as a teacher."" She just said ""oh.""

By this point, the sub was finished so she had to remake it. She said how the grill chef was new and he didn't know. I used her old words against her and said ""well, as the manager, I thought you would have communicated that to him."" 

I asked the cashier quietly for her name, and he writes it on the back of my receipt.

1,"WIBTA if I report my coworkers drug use to my boss after seeing him at an NA meeting? | My brother in law is staying with us right now and was conferencing into his usual NA meeting from the living room (our only home computer is a wired desktop in the living room.) 

We usually clear out to give him privacy, but in this case I forgot my phone somewhere in there and had to quickly go looking for it. 

I happened to go in right in the middle of someone I recognized as my coworker sharing their struggle with drug abuse and strong concerns about a potential relapse. 

We work in a job in which human lives are indirectly at stake and to be compromised at any point during work is unquestionably a risk. We have once yearly drug testing and once in a while we have random drug testing but it’s been years since I’ve been asked to do a random one. 

I’ve been really broken up about whether I should say anything though, because of course, NA is supposed to be private and confidential. And he hasn’t relapsed, he’s just concerned he might. 

I’m so broken up over this but I can’t talk to many people about it without raising suspicion about who it might be which would be worse than just quietly reporting it to the appropriate person. 

I don’t know what will happen if I report him. It might be more frequent random drug tests. Maybe they’ll fire him. I don’t know. It’s a terrible time to lose your job, the guy is working a program, and hasn’t actually relapsed. We all have vices and problems.

1,"AITA for squat pooping on the toilets in my mom’s house? | I’m 22, male. Just graduated college. I make decent money. Living at mom’s home. Mom doesn’t want me to rent. She wants me to save enough for down payment on own home. She pays for nearly everything for me. I will repay her when she’s older and I’m richer. That’s common for Asians. We have 2 bathrooms at home. One in mom’s room and one in hallway that grandma and I use. I’ve been a squat pooper since I was 12. I put my feet on the toilet rim and squat to poop. This is much healthier. No strain. I get everything out. I only need to wipe once this way compared to when I regular sit when I’m using unsturdy toilets. Those times I usually need to wipe about four times and I still have waste matter inside. I told mom about this a few times before. But I learned yesterday that she doesn’t remember me saying this. She must have misunderstood me before. 


Grandma recently has a hard time pooping so mom added a $600 Lotus Smart Bidet to the hallway toilet to stimulate grandma. The bidet makes it impossible to put my feet on the toilet. That’s why I try to use the toilet in mom’s room, but she closes her door when she sleeps from 9p to 6a every day. I usually poop twice a day so sometimes I need to poop in those hours. I bought a $25 Squatty Potty stool from Amazon with my credit card. It’s not as beneficial and effective as straight up squat pooping on the toilet, but it’s the next best thing. 


We share an Amazon account and she’s on there nearly every day. The Squatty Potty takes a week to arrive. She noticed I bought it a day later and asked me about it. I said I need to squat poop and since I can’t anymore after the bidet installation, I need to do the next best thing. She said she doesn’t know I squat poop and I shouldn’t have on the toilet before because it’s dangerous and I could die if the toilet gives in, shatters, and the porcelain cuts my arteries. I’m 200 lbs and never had a problem. My mom also said she doesn’t believe squat pooping has any benefits. I told her it’s more healthy and efficient, but she disagrees. Even though she’s a nurse, she still doesn’t know this. I showed her online sources that point to squat pooping being healthier, however she said she doesn’t want to read it and that it’s bogus. 


She told me to cancel the Squatty Potty order because it’s big and she doesn’t want it in the bathroom. I said I would put it in my room and bring it to the bathroom whenever I need to. She said it’s unhygienic to do that and told me to cancel my order. She’s kind of scary so I try my best to follow her orders. I told her I’ll cancel it. She also wants me to stop squat pooping on her room’s toilet too because she thinks I’m too heavy. I told her I’ve been doing this for 10 years. She yelled at me to stop doing that. I said okay. I’m still going to squat poop on her room’s toilet and on other sturdy toilets though. I cancelled the Amazon order. I’ll just sit down regularly in the hallway one.",False,False
0,"AITA for not cooking for my picky sister and husband? | I consider myself to be a pretty good cook and baker; many people, my friends and family and especially my brother who is a trained chef, have told me this. I am a vegetarian, so I only cook vegetarian meals but most of the time they turn out really well and everyone’s happy with them. At family gatherings and events, I don’t care that everyone else eats meat but I always bring a dish or two to share and a dessert. 

My sister and her husband are not very good cooks, and they eat out probably 4-5x a week for dinner if not more. She’s been pressing me for almost a year to tell me how fun it would be for me to come over to her apartment and help her cook dinner or something.

Now I would be totally happy to go over and help her cook something vegetarian or bake a cake or something. But that’s not what she wants. She and her husband are picky and won’t eat a dinner without meat, won’t eat anything too spicy, won’t eat certain vegetables etc. I don’t feel comfortable cooking meat and especially wouldn’t want to help her cook it and then just watch her eat it while I don’t. She’s specifically mentioned i should show her how to make butter chicken, our mom’s ribs or a roast. I’ve suggested several vegetarian dishes I could help her cook, or suggested she could come over to my house and I would just host a dinner for them. But she refuses. I rarely eat with them and when we do we always go out to eat because there’s just nothing I can cook for her. 

I kind of feel like TA for not cooking for her when she gets all disappointed because everyone else tells her how good my cooking/baking is, but at the same IDEK what the f I would make for her. She’s just so picky and has so many preferences whereas for me, as long as it’s vegetarian, I’ll eat it. She’s weird about food in general and had mentioned before how excited she Ks to try a dessert i’ve made, and then doesn’t eat any. Well go out to eat at a restaurant and we’ll go early because she’ll say how starving she is, and she’ll eat like maybe 1/4 of her plate. It’s frustrating to watch and I feel like she wouldn’t even appreciate anything I made for her. She’s the only person in my family who hasn’t really tried my cooking, except a couple bites of something as a side dish here or there.

1,"AITA for thinking I should not pay? | Sorry for the long post, the full story requires some background.

I’m currently in college and was born into a well off family, enough to be considered top 5% of the income distribution in my country. It was not always this way though, my parents came from honest backgrounds contributing their paychecks to their respective utilities bills as teenagers each month. 

I’ve been fortunate to not have to work for the same reasons and during the summers I used to work to have spending money to have liberties to spend in what I wanted and still contribute.

I decided to commute from college voluntarily which involves a moderate hour commute each way every day and I’m paying for the insurance of the vehicle which amounts to somewhere around $2000 USD each year. The car is electric and cost to power it is very cheap.


Now here’s the issue:

This past semester I’ve failed a course and I’m at risk of losing my internship that I’ve worked hard to obtain. I’m broken every time I see my grades. He says the only way for me to understand what I did is to pay back the credits I failed. I fully understand how I possibly fucked up my immediate future but I haven’t been able to afford anything since he wants to me to try to be partially finically independent. The past summer job was only able to cover the last 6 months and I’m still on the hook for the next 6 and the 6 after IF i start my internship. 

I also feel He’s been unfair as of lately. I pay for all my leisure expenses from video games to dinners with my gf. Since I haven’t been working I’m almost out of funds yet my younger brother for the most part gets everything he asks for no questions asked. This holidays I wasn’t able to afford a christmas gift for my gf and felt ashamed to bring it up to her. I had to cover my expenses out of my account for the secret santa my family forced me into while my brother had his fully paid for by my father. I feel the extra burden of paying the credits is alot specially if I am to have no job while studying and may not even have a well paying job this coming summer.

1,"AITA for refusing to watch my sister’s dog? | My sister has a 110 lb Great Pyrenees that she loves more than anything in the world. The dog is friendly enough but I’ve never liked dogs. I think they are annoying, needy, loud, messy, and overall they just really aren’t my thing. Not to mention her dog is HUGE so it’s 10x worse.

My sister found out her husband had been badly injured while on a business trip and apparently it was a pretty serious situation. She left work and went straight to the airport to get the next flight. While she was at the airport, she texted me asking if I could go to her house and watch her dog for her.

I said no. I am not comfortable with that large of a dog, and like I said I really don’t like dogs at all.  She begged me but I held my ground.  I understand it was a frightening situation but she really should have taken care of her dog before leaving.

She called me crying because I was the only one nearby who could watch her dog. I said sorry but I just wasn’t comfortable. She asked if I’d be willing to drive her dog to our parents 5 hours away. Again, I said no. The dog sheds like crazy and is prone to getting carsick, it would absolutely wreck my car. Plus I felt that asking me to make a 10 hour round trip was a little inconsiderate bc I work full time and have school in the evenings.

Eventually my parents showed up to get the dog but they were pissed at me. They said I was being a selfish asshole and that I should’ve helped my sister out. My sister hasn’t talked to me since. 

I feel that I was well within my rights to refuse to care for the dog for an unspecified amount of time because it made me uncomfortable. My parents and sister obviously disagree.

Btw her husband is fine and is recovering well.

0,"AITA For not wanting to go to MIL's for Thanksgiving? All bc she wants picks of ""her"" grandbabies.. | Ok. Well, It's not as basic as us just avoiding the in-laws for the holidays. MIL has a way of making Hubby and I uncomfortable in a lot of situations. She has started demanding we WILL be at her house for Thankgiving this year because she ""will finally get a picture of all three grand kids in the same room.""

Mind you, we care for Hubby's gma, and this is her first year without gpa here with us for the holidays. I also just went threw loosing my younger brother (He was 22 and literally we jjst went threw with his viewing on Nov. 1st). Gma has treated the loss of my brother as a complete inconvenience to her and MIL acts as though everything is perfect and we should all be super chipper and happy. 

Hubby doesn't want to do much. My parents and I want to do a small dinner together at our house, nothing fancy, and not more then them and us. Gma doesn't want to leave the house this year.

0,"AITA for calling out my friend's fake freckles? | Our school has a monthly magazine made by submissions of poetry, photography, and art from students. I'm the editor for the magazine, part of the committee that helps put everything together. The committee decided to put out another edition this month for the end of school with just photography of diverse people at our school, to show that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. They'd all be taken by a really good photographer at our school and this time not open for submissions. 

There were different categories people could sign up for of traits that weren't always considered conventionally attractive, and one of the categories happened to be freckles. 

Here's where my friend, fake name Melissa, comes in. Melissa has been faking freckles for awhile now. Not just like subtle freckles but all over her face and very noticable. She won't admit that they're fake but I've seen her wash her face and no freckles will be there afterwards. I've also seen her applying them (with a brown eyeliner pencil) and then when she sees me she quickly hides it. She posts selfies on Instagram a lot and you can see inconsistencies between the placement of the freckles from picture to picture. She always vehemently denies that they are fake, which I thought was weird but didn't confront her because I don't really care. 

She applied to model for the freckles category. There was only one person who signed up besides Melissa, a boy named Josh who had real freckles all over his face, arms, and legs. I knew he had been bullied for having them when he was younger, and this was a major blow to his self esteem. For a long time he would use his mom's makeup to try to cover them up. I didn't really know him well but he had been in my classes throughout middle and high school. 

When it was time for the committee to decide who to pick for each category, everyone was quick to vote for Melissa for freckles since she is very popular and Josh isn't that well-known. I decided to speak up, because I thought doing this magazine could be really good for Josh. I told them that Melissa'a freckles were fake and listed some of the things I mentioned above as proof of that. They were all shocked, which surprised me because I thought her freckles were very obviously fake from the beginning, a face covered in freckles doesn't just appear overnight. They asked me if I was sure they were fake, and I said yes and even pulled up her Instagram to show them the inconsistencies. 

After that, the consensus was unanimously that Josh should be the model for that category, and I was happy and thought nothing of it. Everything was great until someone told Melissa why she wasn't picked. 

Melissa got very angry with me and called me berating me for telling the whole committee that she's a liar (I didn't explicitly say that she was) and telling me I ruined her reputation. I'm starting to think I stepped out of line and should've kept my mouth shut. AITA?",False,False
0,"AITA For Asking My Wife To Stop Eating Off My Plate? | Let me explain myself before you offer judgement please. 

This is driving me absolutely insane and turned into a fight for the first time last night. My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say ""oh you can eat off mine too!"" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.

To solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.

She acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.

It's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. 

Yesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, something she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. ""I'm just having a little!"" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.

When we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.",False,False
1,"AITA for getting aggitated at people who act 'extra' at funerals | So I had a great uncle of mine die recently and I do hate funerals mostly because I hate to see people that sad but primarily because everytime there is a funeral someone in my family seemingly wants to be in the spotlight instead of the deceased. 

To start, as people walk in early to look at the open casket one of my aunts practically forced two of her sisters to hold her arms as she walked to the casket . After looking inside she started to scream and shout before basically going dead weight in her sisters arms. They had to practically lift her up and carry her to her seat.

Later in the program as everyone got time to speak about the deceased. An unle of mine took it upon himself to go into a near hour long speech about his times with the deceased . I get it thsy had good times but an hour is a bit much to me.

Lastly i had a seperate aunt who broke away from the program and sung ""you are my hero"" but literally it was an hour long. Im very OCD and like to keep schedule so I like to check my watch every now and then and the entire funeral was waaayyyy off schedule.

0,"WIBTA for asking my roommate to pitch in for the weed she smokes? NSFW | I live in a state where marijuana is legal and often, I restock stuff that I share with my girlfriend. We have been in a long term relationship so we share finances completely. Our roommate and long term best friend hasn't bought anything in a while, which is obviously fine, but I spent a decent amount of money ($200) getting some fun stuff and she actively used/participated. I love when our schedules allow us to relax and have fun like this because we all casually smoke, but she used her fair share and hasn't offered to pay or buy more. I mentioned us running low recently and said something like ""let me know if you want to go in on more together since we bought last time"" and she got a bit offended. We don't have strict money boundaries and will buy each other coffee/pick things up because we live together and don't sweat the small things. However, I recently changed jobs which threw off my finances so I don't have extra money to choose to partake and buy more soon. It's really not a big deal, but a third of $200 is significant in our young adult lives as we're in college and money is generally tight. 

WIBTA for asking her to pitch in or buy next round? I don't want to police her use of our weed because I want to share, but I can't afford to share THAT much and girls night is girls night. If I am TA, I will totally drop it. But if I'm not, would also appreciate some insight on how to navigate the situation if you want to pitch in. She is my close friend and if she chooses not to buy for a while, I don't want to pressure her but she will even smoke when I'm not there using my stuff.",False,False
0,"AITA for proposing to my girlfriend and causing her Muslim father to practically disown her? | I'm American and grew up in a Christian family. My beautiful Fiancee is German and Turkish, and grew up in a strict Muslim family. When her father learned that she was traveling to America to study abroad, he was distraught. When he learned she was dating me, he basically stopped speaking to her entirely. I felt terrible. She loves her father very very much, and I knew I was to blame. When I proposed, he essentially disowned her and said he never wanted to see her again. This broke me and her's hearts. I never intended to cause this much pain and hardship for either of them. Her family wanted her to marry a Turkish man who held their own faith and beliefs, and I can understand that fully, but me and her decided to live our lives the way we wanted and focus on love. 

But still, I feel if I hadn't been in the picture, her relationship with her family would still be okay. I often wonder if it was truly right for me to propose, or if I should've backed off and let her family accept her again. She tells me she made her own choices, and it isn't my fault, but I don't know. Family is so important, and now hers has pushed her away because of me.

1,"AITA for saying the best day of my life had more to do with my ex-girlfriend than my wife? | My little sister (25F) was fondly talking about her wedding that happened two weeks ago. She said that was the best day of her life. I (27M) said that my wedding day that happened last year was awesome too. She asked me if I also thought my wedding day was the best day of my life. My wife (25F) was next to me, but I thought it was best to be truthful and said that was a close second best day of my life. They both asked me at the same time what the best day of my life was then. I told them that it was May 21, 2013. 



I told them the story. I was always a shy virgin kid who had hopes of becoming an actor. By that time, I had been wanting to audition for over two years but never had the courage to. My roommate gave me a shot of vodka and off I went. I took the train to LA and strutted right into the building. I met this beautiful lady in the elevator and she was auditioning too. We helped calm each other down to put our best chops forward. I never felt that comfortable with a woman before. I felt that if I didn’t ask her out after the audition, I would never get this perfect chance to get my first girlfriend again. It took all my courage to ask her out. I was pretty sure I had her at hello, but it still wasn’t easy to do something I have never done before. We had a nice Korean barbecue dinner together and dated for a few months. We both didn’t pass the audition and pursued the safe path. We had to break up because she had to move overseas with her family, but I was a different man after doing something I have always wanted to do in auditioning and also for meeting her. It was a day of many firsts of my life. I became confident in both my career and personal life because of that. 


My wife said she was kind of sad that the best day of my life had to do with my ex-girlfriend and not her. I said that if I hadn’t met my first girlfriend, I probably wouldn’t have met my wife, and everything happens for a reason. I might have been a virgin all my life if I hadn’t shot my shot and she said yes. I said she opened the door for me to many possibilities, and my wife was the best woman I have ever known, and that we have been together for almost five years and hopefully forever. My wife said that since the best day of my life isn’t the day we met or our wedding day, hopefully the best day of my life would be when our first child will be born in March. I told her that this is getting silly and that will probably be one of the top five days of my life. My wife and sister talked about other things afterwards. My wife seemed kind of down from then on.

0,"AITA for asking my fiance to get a vasectomy when we're done having kids? | Basically what the tittle says. A little background. We started dating when I was 20, everything is great, we make each other very happy but because of his age, (Im now 24 and he's 35) he wants to start trying for kids as soon as possible because he doesn't want to be too old when with young kids. ( I should say, he's in great shape, he doesn't look his age)

First this was out of the blue, we'd had the kids talk when we first started dating, and we were on the same page, I didn't want kids until my early 30s if at all and he said he liked kids, but could do with or without, and if we decided to have kids later on, he didn't mind being an older dad, the most important thing was our relationship. I just got my masters and have landed my first good job, I'm really exited about it. its my dream job, I get to travel, see the world plus I'm finally fully independent. I would be putting everything on hold.

I don't feel the slightest bit ready, but this is a dealbreaker for him, so I said yes, I can't picture my life without him, he's my first love and my world and this is really important to him.

 I prefer using condoms but he hates it so I have been on birth control for the past few years and I hate it, I have tried a few diferent ones, but they make me moody, I have no apetite, Im sore etc.  My argument is basically if we spend the next 3 years having kids, when were done  I want him to get a vasectomy.

 I don't think its a big ask. I wanted him to go to our GP to talk about it. He adamantlty refuses. He says its selfish of me to ask.  He doesn't even want to research the procedure a little bit. I feel given I'm sacrifising a lot for our relationship, I would at least like him to realistically consider it or have us use condoms for the rest of our marriage( which like I said, he hates), because I truly do not want to be on birth control for the next few decades. this is really important to me, I need him to agree to this.

1,"AITA For Refusing to Pay for a Piece of Fabric I destroyed? | Fuck it; no throwaway

Yesterday, I sat on a piece of fabric my sister was sewing for a prom dress. Normally I'd be sympathetic, but it's very hard to feel sorry for someone when they're yelling at you and refusing to admit any fault. 

I know this makes me sound like a jerk; so I'll explain why I don't think I'm at fault. Normally I would agree that if you destroy something you should pay for it; however I'd also argue that it requires the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise.

In this case I'd argue that a reasonable person would not think that sitting on a couch would cause this damage because: 
- she laid it right next to a blanket with the same coloration. 
- I'm the only who uses that couch. I had no reason to believe the fabric was on there.
- I was not told about it; again I had no reason to belief she laid anything valuable down.

I'd argue that a reasonable person would have known that leaving it would cause damage because:
-as mentioned, it was next to a blanket of the same color and I often use it to play videogames at night without turning the lights on. Granted this happened during the day but I could easily have sat on it at night.
-she had plenty of other spaces to put it; but she choose a couch where people sit on.
-she left it on there for at least a day; probaly more; I'd be more sympathetic if she had just put it down for a second or two 
-even if I didn't do anything; the cats have been known to pee on it (I'm not an animal; I clean the couch when I'm done.
- she could have just let me know
-

I get why she's mad but at the same time I think it's a little unreasonable to block someone's personal space (she wouldn't have wanted me handling this and I often use it after she goes to sleep) when there are other options available. I really don't why she put it there; but a place where people sit is usually not where you store expensive and/or valuable things. Frankly, if had left my phone or something on the couch she sits on I think she would just call me inconsiderate for leaving it there and say it's all my fault.

1,"AITA for feeling betrayed by my son? | This will be a long one. 

Me and my ex husband divorced about sixteen years ago due to him cheating. We had one son, let's call him Sam. (Age 17). He wants to be a paramedic.

Sam's biological father has never paid child support, and for about the last ten years he hasn't been in my kid's life. He would send birthday and Christmas gifts. Yes, he is my son's father, but if he doesn't want to initiate a relationship by actually talking to him why should I let him have one?

About sophomore year in highschool, Sam's grades began to drop. He went from As and Bs to Cs. He started to play Fortnite more. He began to win some tournaments, told me about sponsorships, but I disliked him playing so much. I made it known that I did not approve of his ""hobby"", (I see it as borderline addiction) and that it would never be a sustainable source of income. He understood that.

This is about when summer started and Sam began taking college classes. (Just to get ahead). He just finished. In one of his classes, he did very well. (Psychology, with an A). But in the other, he did very bad. (Sociology with a D). 

About the time that this ""fortnite world cup"" stuff started (early June?) Sam began playing an unhealthy amount. He said that he had a chance to do something cool, but I just saw it as feeding his addiction. This was also the time that is sociology grade begin to slip. As a consequence we took away his gaming stuff and in turn ""prevented him from competing in a once in a lifetime opportunity"". I said if his poor grades continued then I would have to keep him from volunteering as well. (He loves volunteering, but it was getting in the way of grades almost as much as gaming). That would leave him with nothing to do but getting good grades and helping around the house.

In the last week, he told me that he would finish high school and then move to Texas to start his life. (to live with his bio. father until he could get his own place). His reasoning was that it much cheaper to find housing and to live there overall. It would be easier to find jobs. All these random points that hide his true reasoning for moving away.

We got into a very heated argument which I encountered the first time he ever raised his voice at me. He said that I wasn't being supportive of him. He said that my standards of him were too high. His said that I was taking away anything I could that he cared about. He said that I was too controlling and that I wouldn't listen to what he had to say. He went to his room. I was left crying out of confusion and disappointment. He doesn't understand how hard I have worked to give him the childhood that I never got. (Raised in Oakland slums by parents who were always on drugs.) I went to school for for eight years to get my masters degree. All for him to pick a career that he doesn't have to go to college for.

In the past financial year we're directly responsible for X-thousands of people being made redundant and saving companies fat stacks of money. Basically, people are fallible flesh-bags and where practical we try and replace it with predictable, repeatable solutions.

This came to awkward scenario. We did an audit of a local industrial company that my parents work at. Throughout this audit, at times, I had to interact with departments/areas my parents were involved in to elicit processes, requirements, etc. After the review, we found we could cut over 60 jobs and improve output with introduction of a particular of-the-shelf solution that required some modification. We provided training and additionally audited aptitude and performance to note which workers would be best to retain, retrain or retrench.

The result (based on metrics and my work) was that my parents were part of this mass redundancy. I was not allowed to give my parents a heads up. After the news, my parents were/are livid at me. They're telling me I had no loyalty to them and should have fudged numbers to keep them there because they're not not going to find new jobs at their age. They asked me how I can sleep at night knowing I put them out of work. 

I told them that I take my job seriously, do my job well and I'm proud of doing a good job. But now my parents, siblings, extended family and some family friends are pretty much angry at me. I've gotten various messages that follow the theme that I should be ashamed.

1,"AITA for walking out of my son’s therapy appointment after him and his therapist blamed me for his homophobia? | I came out as gay three years ago at 38 years old. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do, and I still can’t believe I had the strength to do so. I have faced backlash from my community, my friends, and my family, but I have learned to love myself and not blame myself anymore. 

Before I was out I was married to a man. We had two kids together, but obviously divorced when I came out. Two weeks ago , my son got expelled from his private school because him and his friends left disgusting notes in a gay kid’s locker. The notes said “f*g” “ladyboy” “tw*nk” “AIDS” and other disgusting things. 

Obviously, I was beyond hurt and disappointed at Brian’s behavior. When I tried to talk to him, he said he “wouldn’t act this way if I wasn’t a f*cking d*ke”. At this point, I realized his behavior was out of control decided to get him into a therapy appointment. 

We went to therapy yesterday, and Brian said that the reason he lashed out was because *I* gave him negative associations with being gay because I hurt his father. I expected the therapist to shut that down instead of using the divorce as an excuse for homophobia (which is why I booked the appointment in the first place), but he never did that. He just made Brian talk more about how my gayness hurt his life. 

I left the appointment. Reddit, I am tired of being told that who I am justifies hate and homophobia in my loved ones. I already dealt with depression and alienation during that first year and I will not blame myself again. I love my son more than anything, but there is no “good reason” for homophobia and bullying. And I refuse to entertain a conversation that makes it seem like having a gay mom is a reasonable reason to be a homophobe.

1,"AITA for giving my parents crap for not letting me drink now? | So I'm 20 but I turn 21 in late July. In the past I've never had any problems with my parents letting me drink at home in moderation ever since I graduated high school, things like letting me have a wine cooler with a meal, have a beer watching a movie at home, my mom ordered a rum and Coke and gave it to me at a wedding reception, they let me have a few shots at their friends' New Year's party, etc. Also they told me that as long as turn over my car keys to them for the night they won't question me about going to my friends places or what happened there, so I'll have my friend picks me up or take an Uber if I'm going to a party of my friends at home that'll probably have drinking. 

This summer they basically cut all that off once I got back home. My mom once asked to see my ticket stub when I told her I was going with my friend to a movie (I actually did so it wasn't an issue but I was frustrated by the lack of trust), they aren't giving me liquor or beer ever. When I asked my mom why the big change she said that my dad and her let me drink in limited amounts under controlled situations because they knew I would probably drink anyway and was at college, so this let me do it safely and not feeling repressed where I'd go drinking unsafely or driving drunk. But since I'm turning 21 so soon there's no need for this and the safest thing to do is just wait because it's pretty short anyway. She said she'll allow the occasional wine cooler with a meal until then but that's it.

This makes no sense to me so I kind of blew up at her. Since then I've been almost giving the silent treatment. I also can't believe I'm almost 21 and being treated like I'm back in high school. But now I'm feeling a bit guilty. Was I being a dick?",False,False
0,"AITA for wanting to go no contact with my older sister | As a teenager, my older sister took care of me when I was a baby whilst my mom was in hospital and my dad was busy with a full time job. She also used to spend a lot of time with me as a kid and regularly took me to do things like bowling or watch a movie at the cinema. However, as we both grew older she started to become more resentful as I lived a relatively easier life compared to hers.

Despite me being an introvert and she constantly pushed me towards being an extrovert and would berate me for choosing to stay in and read a book rather than go out with friends in my free time. This eventually contributed to unhealthy behaviours, such as, forcing myself to go out and socialise at university even when I was exhausted and desperately wanted to have 'me time'. My sister also criticises my looks, my behavior, my choices, etc, which has contributed to me developing severe depression. I also grew up with a long-term health condition which has caused some serious problems throughout my life. When I was in hospital with a virus, she came to visit me and complained that I wasn't drinking enough water (which I couldn't because I was vomiting everything that I ate or drank) and laughed at me when I squirmed in pain as I received an injection in my stomach.  When I decided to study abroad, she constantly thought I couldn't do so. However, when I actually went she was messaging me, commenting on my photos and asking my parents where I have been and what I have been doing.

She constantly puts me down and does the same to my parents as well. She lectures and shouts at them if they make a mistake or doesn't act how she wants them to. For example, my parents take care of her kid every weekend and she tells them off if they say that they would like to have some weekends to themselves. She assumes that since they have both retired, they have nothing else better to do on the weekend. However, if my parents ask her to do something for them she flat out refuses and says that she is busy despite making other arrangements with her friends.

I push back, citing that I’ve slept in the same bed with my boyfriend for 4 years. My mom isn’t interested in negotiating. It’s “just not going to happen under her roof”. She said when we’re married we can sleep in the bedroom together.

I’m pissed off and think this is ridiculous. My boyfriend agrees and refuses to sleep on the couch.  What’s the move here? I get that it’s her house and her rules but I’m not willing to abide by them.",False,False
0,"AITA for leaving my drunk girlfriend in the car after trying multiple times to wake her up? | We've been having issues for the past few months, and I guess this was one of the final straws for the both of us and it eventually lead to us breaking up a month or so later, but I still can't get it out of my head. 

a little background, we live in a very nice town in Utah where absolutely nothing happens (I've lived here 14+ years and don't even remember any occurrences of break ins or anything). We live in the same house, different rooms though, and have been together about a year and a half. About a month ago, we went up with her brothers into the mountains for a small get together, and she ended up getting pretty drunk. Within minutes of leaving (at 1 A.M mind you), she was asleep and didn't wake up for the hour plus drive home. 

Upon pulling into the driveway, I put my hand on her leg and rubbed it a bit and tried to wake her up,  to which she pushed my hand away and somewhat aggressively said ""don't touch me."" I was a bit taken back and offended, after all my girlfriend just got mad at me for even touching her, but I let it go and told her we're home, not to forget her phone charger in the car, and that I was going to get all of our stuff and her dog into the house (to which she replied O.K and went back to sleep). Not wanting to get in trouble for touching her again, I proceeded to load everything into the house trying to be as loud as I can so she hopefully wakes up (even left the car door open while I took the dog to the bathroom so the lights would wake her up). 

I went inside, put the dog in the kennel for the night, and after using the bathroom came out to her calling my phone. When I answered it, she was LIVID that I'd left her in the car and that if I actually cared about her I would have never left her in the car (though she was only out there for MAYBE 20 minutes). 

she says everyone she's talked to about it says I'm completely in the wrong and that they'd NEVER leave someone in the car, meanwhile a friend of mine has asked many people and has came back saying that they would have done the exact same thing I did... AITA?",False,False
1,"WIBTA If I started handing out psychiatrist business cards to strangers throwing adult temper tantrums? | I live in an area full of entitled wealthy people who, for some reason, find it reasonable to throw ridiculous tantrums in public when things don’t go their way. 

For example, the other day I was in a drive thru and the woman ahead of me would not move forward after other cars ahead of her moved. After waiting for a minute, I honked at her. She didn't move but instead started screaming at me and flailing around until a worker came out.

This is not a singular occurrence. I’ve seen these ridiculous people everywhere, in parking lots, coffee shops, grocery stores, harassing people over the dumbest shit. Shit like this happens daily and i’m fucking sick of it and want these people to realize that they look like fucking lunatics when they throw their tantrums.

I recently changed psychiatrists because the office at my old one’s office was poorly run. I still have business cards for my old psychiatrist and thought it would be funny if I handed them out to these adults throwing tantrums under the guise of concern for their mental health. Who knows, maybe it would be a wake up call. However, it might be considered an asshole move as it may belittle those with actual mental health issues. 

WIBTA if I started handing out these cards to these super dramatic entitled adult toddlers?

1,"AITA for allowing a coworkers daughter to eat candy from the bowl on my desk and allow her to snack out of my lunch? | I am not a very good writer so this is pretty hard for me and I'm having trouble getting started. I guess it's to say that I work for a pretty typical ""cube farm"" type business. My cubicle is on the corner closest to the elevator so it's my ""thing"" to have a huge candy bowl that I keep stocked with a big variety of candy. People are a huge fan of it for obvious reasons. 

Our school district starts school next week and every year there is a week where there are no camps and child care can be an issue so our regional supervisor allows co workers to bring kids in that week, sets up movies and xboxs in the conference room, trips to the park and mall, etc... of course the kids flock to my desk because of the candy and I love being the ""candy lady."" 

I guess this is a second part but there is a coworker who I don't really like for a myriad of reasons but her daughter is my absolute favorite of all the kids who have been her this week. Her mom is an advocate of every crazy diet you can put a name on so it broke my heart when the mom said that her daughter is on all the same diets. I am in eating disorder recovery so this is literally heart breaking because when I hear fad diets like fasting and protein I just see my past in this little girls future. Her mom said she could have one piece of candy a day from my bowl but I could tell she was starving so every time I saw this girl I would ""sneak"" her a piece of candy. It just gave me real joy to see her face light up. It wasn't a problem this week but today I went to McDonalds and ""just so happened"" to get an extra coke and fries and when I got back I went in and set up a little picnic and asked the girl if she'd like to join me. I gave her the fries and coke and she said she's never allowed to drink soda and can only have fries when they go to her grandmas house and she said she was loving this. I asked her if she was hungry a lot and she said she was always hungry. It just broke my heart, like literally broke my heart. 

The person who works across from me saw me feeding the girl the fries and coke she said that I majorly screwed up and that if the girls mom found out she was going to flip her lid. I made a joke about her blood sugar being low and my coworkers said this really wasn't something to laugh about and while he wasn't going to say anything, if the mom finds out she's going to go ballistic and want me fired.

0,"WIBTA if I don’t give my wife a huge birthday party? | For the last couple years my wife has gotten pretty large birthday parties. Really huge. Like renting a mansion and fireworks huge.
 
My wife is currently 9 months pregnant and she could pop at any moment. She is currently a bit overdue, just by a day. Her birthday is in a week, and I really don’t think I can plan it. I’m already extremely worn by taking care of my wife and kid. I really don’t think I have the mental capacity to plan an entire party. I’m just planning to make a regular at-home dinner, a cake, and a gift. Nothing too fancy.
 
When I told my wife that, she got really angry at me. She said she’s doing so much for us, and that I’m not pulling my weight. That hurt me a lot. She doesn’t know half the shit I do here. But, she is very pregnant, and I am blaming hormones.
 
So, AiTA?",False,False
1,"AITA for wanting my husband to support me if I quit my job for mental health reasons? | I’d really like some perspective. 

My husband and I are newlyweds (24F/M married for 1 year) and over the past few months we’ve been fighting.

I work as a waitress and my husband earns roughly 5x what I do as an engineer. I also suffer from generalized anxiety and depression which he knew since he met me. Two months ago I had a breakdown during my shift and since then my anxiety has gotten progressively worse every time I went to work. A few weeks ago I sat my husband down and told him I want to quit my job and just focus on my mental health for a while. I told him work was making me sick and the money I was making wasn’t contributing much to our household anyways. 

So I quit and have spent recent weeks healing myself mentally and physically. I do yoga in the mornings and meditate in the evenings. I have a good therapist and I can feel myself getting stronger and gaining clarity every day. My husband started off really supportive at first but not even a month in he has started to nag me and pick at me over tiny things in our home.

I tell him that I plan to get back to work eventually but right now I really need to focus on me. I can’t be any use to anyone if my mental health isn’t where it needs to be. He understands this to an extent but still managed to throw barbs at me, like getting annoyed at me if the house isn’t in perfect condition when he gets home, or if I accidentally leave clothing or makeup lying around and he sees it.

A few days ago we had a big fight because he was like “Why aren’t you doing more cooking/cleaning/laundry since you have so much time” and I told him that I’m not taking time off to be his stay at home wife and do his bidding. That I’m taking a mental health break doesn’t mean I’m suddenly his maid or mother.

We fought because I accused him of not understanding what I’m going through and resenting me simply because I quit my job. I said that if he were sick and I was the breadwinner I’d be more than supportive of his break for mental health. He called me a lazy and a leech and I stormed out the house and stayed with a friend.",False,False
0,"AITA for not donating my sperm to my friend who wants to get pregnant and raise the child as a single mother? She also says it's because she wants attractive kids. |   I have a friend, Sarah, who has always wanted kids. She loves her niblings and always spoils them but recently she's had a 'baby craze' and wants her own. Except, she's not in a relationship. So it seems obvious right? If you want a kid but you're not married go get a sperm donor or adopt. She doesn't want to adopt because she wants the kids to be hers biologically. She also doesn't want a sperm donor because, in her words, she wants her kids to be attractive. 

&#x200B;

  Here's for some reason where I come in. Yesterday she proposes to me that \*I\* should be the donor. She says it's better because she knows me and because I'm attractive (no, not a humble brag, we both have blue eyes and she wants the kid to have blue eyes too). I feel... uneasy about this for multiple reasons. First I don't think I can live w/ myself knowing the kid is biologically mine but I can't raise him. Also there is something about the whole ""I want my kid to be attractive/have blue eyes"" that strikes me wrong, it feels like eugenics honestly. 

&#x200B;

  I tell her I'm not comfortable with donating my sperm and she completely FLIPPED, as in started hysterically crying and throwing anything she can reach at me. I think she expected me to agree. I went home and my brother said it would make her happy if she had my kid and I should've just sucked it up and donated since it won't affect me in any way. I just told him if he's so sympathetic he's practically a clone of me and can go donate his sperm. My friend is making me type this post right now because he doesn't know what to think. Am i the asshole for not donating sperm to my friend and denying her the right to have attractive kids? It's not like there's no other guys with blue eyes, jesus.",False,False
1,"AITA for arguing with my mom for the millionth time about my grades? | I was told to post this here
For some back story, I'm the youngest (16) for my mom. I have 3 older siblings who live on there own and have kids and such. My grades for school are not the best, I have 2 D's and a C+. 
My mom said I had homework for my art class, I checked and I don't. She then complains that I have a B in that class, she expects an A from me. The reason I don't is because I forget to turn in my weekly uploads, i explain this and she laughs at me. She keeps going on how I have time to do and that it's bullshit that I forget because I can just remind myself with a calendar and such. She then brings in my depression into and then some other things. I get upset and leave and she gets pissy with me. I can hear her complaining how I'm too focused on having a boyfriend or not, or focused on other people's lives than my own. She tells my dad they obviously went wrong somewhere. 
She also thinks I'm pouting. 
I'm just shocked and overall lost. No matter what I do and what I try to explain it isn't enough for them. ""Why are you getting a D in this class?"" It's hard and I don't understand. ""Why don't you ask for help?"" They make me feel like I'm dumb all the time and dismiss my need for Help. ""Why are you getting a C?"" He hasn't turned anything in. ""Well, all you have to do is show up and work, you shouldn't be getting a C."" He hasn't turned anything in since February, that's not in my control. 
I constantly feel like I'm being compared to my older siblings. They did better in school that I did, they're successful and happy and then there's me. The absolutes fuck up. I feel like whatever I do isn't enough. They expect so much from me and I can never meet their expactions. 
Am I overreacting? Am I in the wrong for feeling this way? AITA?",False,False
