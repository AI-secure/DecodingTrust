"AITA for telling my SO I'm not willing to adopt a child of addict parents | My SO (F27) and I (M28) have been together for 4 years now. I know for a fact that she is not willing to become pregnant herself and I accepted that because I believe we are a good match and I do love her deeply. Afterall it's her body and nobody can force her to put herself through pregnancy. Now even though she wouldn't mind living life without raising a child, I would like to raise one, one day.  So we've been talking about other options.  

As most likely it is going to be one child only, I would prefer to be genetically linked to that child for two main reason. The first is that I would feel more connected to the child and second because I believe my SO and I have a lot to offer genetics-wise.  

My SO, being someone who occasionally hosts stray dogs and cats at our apartment till they rehabilitate and we find them a new home, is looking into the option to adopt a child. She mentioned how children of addict parents have it really tough and even after getting away from their parents their personality is not that easy and untrusting which may result in them changing foster homes multiple times and/or becoming 18 without any. So maybe adopting such a child is something I would consider doing.  

My answer to this was that I'm willing to donate or volunteer in order to help such children but when it comes to raising such a child myself, I don't think I have it in me.  
During the conversation, I mentioned multiple times how a child of our genes pool would probably have a higher potential in my point of view (came out too narcissist, I know) but that's only because I see in myself a lot of what my parents have, intellectual and personality wise (narcissist again?).  
I explained that I'll be putting a lot of time, effort, and money in my child as it's some kind of an investment. It would make me glad to know my child grows up to be a great decent person. And I know that I will accept my biological child as is, no matter what it is like.  
The sad thing is, I can't say that for certain if we adopted a child. And that's not the child's fault, I know, it's all mine. I just can't make that promise. I'm not saying things can't change if that actually happened, I'm just saying it's a risk that I'm not willing to take as the consequences can be too hard to overcome.   
Last thing I mentioned was that if we were to adopt a child, the child's parents (if known) and the environment the child was born into would have a great weight in my decision. I am aware this sounds too much like IATA, but if we're going to raise one child only, I wouldn't make the decision based on which child needs the most help (again sounds like IATA, but I'm just trying to be real with myself here).  

Needless to say, SO did not like my point of view at all. So here I am asking, AITA? And would appreciate if someone who went through something similar can share their story. 

Well, after saying all that I probably should go volunteer somewhere over the weekend to balance out my karma.  

----------------
----------------

EDIT - For the people who didn't like the genetics comments, for all you know I may be the dumbest ugliest person alive, but I am satisfied with my genetics. Whether it is an appearance, personality or an intellectual trait, no matter how good or bad, I would love to be able to say the child got that from me / my SO.  

EDIT - Allow me to try and rephrase my ""investment"" comment. I didn't mean that I'm expecting any kind of return from it. But the opposite, it is an investment in the child's future where the child is the only benefit from it. I merely provide the tools and means in the best way I can so when the time comes to make own decisions, the child will be up for that."
"AITA for refusing to put my kids on the same schedule as my sister’s kids while we’re living with her? | I’m living with my sister for a while, renting out her back bedrooms.  

I have two kids, 4 and 9, and she has two kids 5 and 7. 

She has always had her kids on a pretty exact schedule (e.g., wake up 7:00am, breakfast 7:45 am, 3:00pm homework time, 4:30pm TV time, 5:00 dinner time, etc.)

That’s fine and great that it works for her, but my kids and I have always done things a bit more loosely. 

My sister thought when we moved in we’d coordinate our kids schedules to match, but I explained my kids wake up between 6:00 and 8:00, my 4 year old eats whenever she gets up, and my 9 year old doesn’t usually eat breakfast at all, some days they’ll watch a couple hours of tv, sometimes they’ll go all week without wanting to turn it on, that it just depends. 

After a couple days she said it was disruptive to her kids that they saw these other two close in age kids who got to do things when they felt like it instead of following a schedule, and that it was causing tension, so I should just put my kids on something at least close to their schedule. 

For the last few days I’ve been pretty set that I’m not going to force my kids to stop doing what’s worked for them their whole lives just because her family does things differently. 

We were just talking about it again and I said “It’s just not a reasonable request. If we weren’t family would you be asking me to modify the structure of my and my kids life to match yours?” And she said “If you weren’t family I wouldn’t have let you live here in the first place.” 

That really made me stop and reflect. Now I’m wondering if I’m being an asshole for unintentionally making her life harder when she intentionally extended me a kindness. 

AITA?

**Edit:** Wanted to clarify the question of my rent since it’s been asked a few times. I pay market value for an *apartment* with commensurate bedrooms, facilities, and overall quality with a price the reflects the short term nature of the lease, not just the rooms themselves. We worked it out this way because I knew I would of course need a kitchen. 

I was unclear in a comment explaining these are privileges not extended to other renters. The other renters air Air BnB renters, so pay much less than I do, as they don’t expect to be able to use these facilities. 

Usually the use of them is not on the table for prospective renters as they’re more like hotel guests. That’s why I considered it a privilege, not because I wasn’t paying for it, I am paying for it. My bad for not clarifying this at the outset."
"AITA for hanging up on my friend after she second guessed my medical opinion? | Background: I’ve been a doctor for 10 years now, and occasionally I will get text messages and calls from friends and family for things. For the most part, it doesn’t really bother me, as long as I have a genuine relationship with a person and I don’t feel like they are using me.


So she texted me yesterday about a “mole” that she had on her upper body, and asked me how much I knew about them. I’m not a dermatologist by any means, but I know enough to know what I don’t know, and when to defer to a specialist. 


After trying to get her to describe the mole over text, I gave up and just used video chat, because a picture is worth 1000 words. I look at it for about 30 seconds, don’t see anything that looks out of the ordinary, and deduce in my mind that its most likely an ingrown hair. 


Me: well, that looks like pretty much an ingrown hair, given what you told me about it and where it is

Friend: oh ok, that’s pretty much it?

Me: yeah that’s pretty much it, I don’t see anything that would cause me to get worked up or excited. 

Friend: thanks, but are you sure?

Me: (slightly annoyed) yes...

Friend: well because I was reading on webmd and it said-

Me: hangs up phone, goes back to enjoying my beer. 

Another friend that was hanging out at my house and privy to the conversation thought it was mean of me to hang up on her like that, but I don’t think he fully understands. It’s very frustrating to take time out of your day, give your medical opinion (for free), and then have someone tell you that they want to take the advice of the internet. Am I wrong for just hanging up and carrying on with my day?"
"WIBTA for naming my daughter a very unique name? | I’m due in February with my daughter. My husband has been very lenient on the name because he understands how hard pregnancy is. 

We are both from India and so I wanted to name our daughter Neelakshi, an Indian name meaning blue-eyed girl. We’d call her Nikki for short. 

When I told my husband this he was taken aback but ambivalently accepted it. When I decided to tell all our family at Thanksgiving they were very disapproving, saying how I was setting her up to be misspelled, mispronounced, and made fun of for life. 

But I’ve always wanted to name my first daughter Neelakshi, though now everyone is mad at me over it. 

WIBITA for naming my daughter Neelakshi?"
"AITA for cancelling an Uber Eats order after it was at my door because the driver was being difficult? | I (19M) ordered mcdonalds thru uber eats yesterday, it was processed and the driver was on the way to my house.

As it got on my street, I noticed that the automatic location thingy accidentally put the house right next to mine, so I messaged the uber driver to correct the mistake, she must have not seen it in time because she was walking up to the other house.

I opened my door and called her to let her know that it was my house. She stood there for like 3 minutes telling me that it was for the house next over, and I told her that it was a mistake and the wrong address was put in.

She then cautiously walked over to her car while keeping her eyes on me to check her phone.

There was someone else in that car who I could only assume was her (looked about 20) daughter, they were whispering to each other for like 5 more minutes, they were talking in a foreign language, but from the sound of it, her daughter seemed really nervous for what ever reason.

Then she started walking up to my door sideways (so that her shoulder was pointing towards me) very fucking slowly. The whole time she was creeping up to my door, her daughter was calling out to her mom every time she took 4 steps.

Ok, I get that safety is important, but I told her like 5000 times to just check her phone for the message that I sent to her phone to confirm that it was the wrong house.

When she got to my door she handed me the bag but then pulled it back and said ""wait, can you tell me the confirmation code?"" or something like that.

I asked her what a confirmation code was and she said ""you tell me..."". I then asked her where it was and she said it was on the phone (yeah no fucking shit), I asked her where again, and she said ""in the app"". I told her I'd send her another message from my phone since we obviously both didn't know where the confirmation code was. She then told me no, and that she needed to see what the confirmation code was.

The whole time this was going on her daughter was pleading with her mom to come back to the car, and finally I just said to keep the fucking food and slammed the door.

I called the uber help line to get a refund and tell them about the ordeal. My gf said that I was being an asshole to that lady since it wasn't her fault that the address registered the wrong address. She also said I just cost that lady gas, and the 2 separate companies money because I cancelled my order.

I can understand that, but that whole situation took like 30 fucking minutes (on top of waiting for the food to be prepared, and her trip over), and I wasn't going to wait any longer for cold food. AITA?"
"AITA for objecting to the baby name my wife picked? | I’m really in a sticky situation with my wife, and I need some help sorting out who is right. Obviously, this is a throwaway. 

My wife (32F) and I (30M) are expecting our first child in October. I’ve never really cared about names, and I told my wife she had carte blanche in choosing. She has slightly stronger opinions than me, and I’m happy to have her pick for us. 

The problem: she wants to name our daughter Narkia (nar-KEY-uh) for a childhood friend. I really hate it — it reminds me of narcolepsy, narcan, narcissism, narcotics etccc. I told her I didn’t like it, and she accused me of going back on our agreement. To her, I made her do the hard work of finding a name, only to throw in my 2 cents at the last minute. We are now at an impasse, and we only have a month before our daughter arrives. 

AITA?

To add: our cultures might be relevant here. My wife is black, and I have a Vietnamese mom and white dad.

Edit to add: looks like I’m the asshole— I will apologize to my wife for not being involved from the beginning. I’m also going to suggest Karina (anagram of Narkia), Kia, or Raykia (similar sound). I respect that my wife wants to honor her friend, but I can’t get rid of the bad connotation of Nark. Some people have asked, and we will probably go with a middle name from my culture."
"AITA for getting irritated with my sister for eating my leftover pizza? | This is the pettiest, most immature thing I’ve ever posted, but fuck it. Fridge etiquette must be established.

So, my (F19) birthday was yesterday, and my parents always offer to cook my favorite meal on my birthday. I asked for my dad to make his delicious pizza, and he happily obliged. Each pizza had 4 slices, and he made 3 of them. We ate all but 2 slices.

Come this morning, and I go downstairs for lunch to discover that those 2 slices are gone. I asked my sister (F20) if she ate both of them. She said yes. I look in the sink and see slices of mushroom at the bottom; she had picked them off the pizza and tossed them into the sink. Disrespectful to pizzas everywhere :(

The following text conversation ensued:

Me: “Not cool. That was my birthday dinner. Could’ve left one slice for me.”

Sister: “No one said don’t eat it. If was in the fridge and it was leftovers.”

Me: “Common sense, [sister’s name]. You could just say ‘I’m sorry’”

Sister: “And you could relax. There’s other food too.”

Me: “Don’t tell me to relax! Jesus. What do you expect me to say to that? “Wow, thanks, let me relax now.” It was literally my birthday food. It would’ve been ok if you just apologized.”

End of conversation. Yeah. I went off the handle a little bit there, but that is because we have established well over 10 times in the past that I don’t like being told to “relax.” She said that intentionally to irritate me. She also has a track record of *never* apologizing for anything, even when it’s much bigger than leftover pizza.

I brought it up to my parents and they seemed to side with me, calling her “rude” because she didn’t ask me first. Then we all went on with our day because it’s just a couple slices of pizza.

But I’ll be damned, Reddit, if we don’t lay down the pizza law today once and for all. AITA?"
"AITA for not liking my girlfriend’s art | English is not my first language so I apologize in advance.

My girlfriend has always been into drawing and painting. She would love to become a professional artist. She is very committed but also very hard on herself. This is (I think) made worse by me being a hobbyist as compares herself.

My job is unrelated to the arts but I make it for fun for my friends and family sometimes. I'm a more analytical person and good at finding strengths and weaknesses, also applies to my own work. I have a good sense of balance, colors and proportion but I can lack in anatomy and consistency. I am far from the best artist but compared to the average person I do pretty well. Sometimes people pay me for small things.

I also see the strengths and weaknesses in her work. She struggles with her creativity and coloring. Her ideas tend to be cliche, for example if she was asked to draw a picture of depression she may draw a girl crying with a broken heart in the background. Part of this is probably just lack of confidence.

She has been taking classes for a very long time however. Many teachers. But her work is not very good and looks like she just started. Her technique is not the issue for me (that is lacking too but not the issue), but that she has a lack of that innate thing. The way to match colors, the way to place things. Making ideas. Those areas I don’t see it.

It’s not the money at all. If I saw the talent I would love to encourage her. But I feel a little hollow trying to hype her up for something I don’t believe it. I’ve gently made suggestions like why don’t we try printmaking together, why don’t we try sculpture. But she is set on being a fine artist even though she often says that she notices other people are unimpressed. She wants to make comics even though she has never even made one for fun. And I’m lost. 

Feeling like TA, am I?"
"AITA for being upset and ignoring my friend because he wont share his winnings at casino | So basically today my friend and I went to the casino. He didn't want to play since he was low on money so I gave him 50$ to gamble so we could have fun together. Basically him and I played a couple games of baccarat. I lost the all the money i bet however he won almost quadruple the $50 I gave him. I asked him if he could share his winnings since it was my money he was risking. That's not what he thinks, he thinks that since he won, its his money and he doesnt need to give me any. I was upset after he said this and told him that it was a dick move on his part.  Anyways, Ive been ignoring his texts telling me to get on discord. AITA here for being upset and ignoring my friend?

Edit: After reading comments, i decided to tell him that im upset with him about him not returning atleast the $50 i gave him. He didnt seem to care that i was upset. I guess this is a small price to pay to see what kind of friend he is."
"AITA for putting my foot down about a shopping cart and making a girl cry? | Honestly this is so childish but it's causing a lot of drama hence I'm on a throwaway

I (F21) went grocery shopping with my roommate and her friend 'Jess' (F23). I kind of know this girl but we're not super close. After we got done with our shopping and we were taking our bags out of the cart, Jess went to leave the cart outside the entrance to the store instead of taking it back to the cart storage thing. So I told her to take it back to where it belongs.
She said, ""It's fine, everyone does it,"" 
So I insisted that she take it back. It was literally a few extra steps away. She refused again. So I offered to do it. She said, ""Just leave it, it doesn't matter.""  
So I took the cart back and told her, ""You can't just leave it and expect someone else to clear up after you, it's really inconsiderate.""
My roommate told me drop the issue but Jess was annoying me a bit by this point, so I explained to her that if everyone did that and left them all over the parking lot then the poor workers would have to go around and gather up all the carts, people wouldn't be able to get into parking spaces - it'd just be carnage. I told her she was being lazy and how hard is it to follow basic social etiquette. Maybe my tone of voice was a bit harsh but I wasn't trying to insinuate anything by calling her lazy, although she is on the larger side and didn't like that comment at all.

So then she throws a bit of a tantrum saying things like ""I'm sick of people always telling me what to do!"" and ""stop talking to me like I'm stupid!"" and starts crying. So I'm standing there outside the store next to a grown-ass woman having a meltdown about a damn shopping cart.   
I told her, 'You're just being childish now.'

My roommate then said, ""Look what you've done, you've made her cry now,"" and asked me to apologize to Jess. I apologized for my tone of voice but said I wasn't going to apologize for what I said because I wasn't in the wrong. Jess was huffy with me and the journey back home was frosty. Since then I've been getting messages off mutual friends telling me I was out of line for making her cry. 

I honestly feel like I've done nothing wrong, she was acting like a total brat over something as stupid as a shopping cart and is currently no longer speaking to me, just getting other people to send me messages about what a bitch I am. As I've said, I've already apologized for my tone(which was sharp but not aggressive) but I'm not going to apologize for insisting she act with basic social decency (i.e. putting your damn cart back when you've finished using it). I could have just taken back the cart myself and not said anything, instead of challenging her on it though so AITA?

ETA: So it seems there's a pretty even split as to whether I was TA or not. Just a quick update: 

1. I did return the cart after Jess refused to do so. I shouldn't have escalated the situation. 

2. I don't know her that well and I realize I'm neither her parent nor boss so that didn't give me the right to tell her off. In future I will try to lead by example rather than become annoyed when people exhibit uncivic-minded behavior. I am of the view that just because 'everyone does it', doesn't make something the right thing to do, but I will watch my tone/ behavior so as not to come off overly self-righteous. 

3. I shouldn't have included the comment relating to her physique in the post because it's honestly irrelevant. 

4. I have decided Jess and I are not compatible for a close friendship, and while I will be civil with her on group occasions and I will also no longer be giving her rides to the grocery store, etc."
"WIBTA if I set an ultimatum for my overweight dancepartner (ballroom)? | Before anyone goes to call me out on fat shaming. No. This is not what this post is about in the slightest. I'm all about healthy body positivity and encouragement to love yourself.      


Now that this is out of the way, let me try to explain my situation. I've been doing ballroom and latin tournament dancing for about two years now, my partner is a female around my age (19) who is overweight. Now don't get me wrong, she isn't obese, she is actually pretty fit for her body type, but there is still a significant difference in weight between her and the other girls in our club. She was the one who actually encouraged me to start training, was always patient with me when we agreed to be partners and helped me build up confidence to dance like I do today. I owe her alot, and she is a very close friend even privately.     

We've never really had to argue but recently there has been some tension rising between us. As of now, I do not have the time to train like I would half a year ago. Graduating from highschool and a part time job don't allow for 5 training sessions along with a class or private lesson per week. She was already very upset when I told her I would have to limit it to 2 per week max.      


She expects us to go back to the absolutely exhausting schedule once i have more time and I honestly lost most of my motivation for such high intensity training. I still want to participate and go there once or twice a week, but even that is getting harder and harder the better we get. And of course not all, but most, problems we encounter stem from her weight. We need time to get movements or techniques down, that take the others a fraction of what we waste, and I feel like part of that really comes from how much she weighs. She always talks high and mighty about how she wants to get a breast size reduction because of her back, but can't do it due to the state not paying it unless she weighs significantly less than she does now. She says she's on a diet but I always catch her snacking on something unhealthy, sweet or fatty when we hang out.     

Now, WIBTA if I told her I do not want to continue our training unless she _drastically_ changes her eating habits? Because I do not feel like investing this much time just because she cannot restrain herself, while I actually set up a diet and exercise plan for myself, even though I am fit as is. I'm strict with myself and try my best to make this partnership work, but feel like she only ever has motivation to be all competetive about dancing, but never about her body.      
     


Again. She is my close friend. I do not wish to upset or hurt her feelings at all. She is very dear to me, but this is not fun for me anymore.
      

Edit: I live an hour away from the city without a car and have to rely on public transportation, which is scarce here. I workout 5 times a week myself to stay fit, this was her suggestion in the first place."
"AITA for not being ready to forgive my sister after she decided my daughter couldn't be her flower girl for her wedding | My sister got married recently. She wanted my daughter to be one of her flower girls. We went through all the necessary events for this, dress fittings, rehearsals etc. Then on the day of the wedding she tells me she no longer wants my daughter to be a flower girl. This really pissed me off because my daughter was really looking forward to this. I originally decided i wouldn't even go to the wedding but eventually my wife convinced me to go and support my sister so I bit my tongue and went to the ceremony. Played nice and all that.

&#x200B;

Now it's been a few weeks and she is back from her honeymoon. She called me and wants to hang out because she needs her \[brother\] time. I told her was still angry at her and I and my family don't feel the need for \[sister\] time yet. She said sorry she couldn't have daughter be a flower girl but... I hung up on her at this point.

&#x200B;

Now my parents and other siblings are mad at me and think I should apologize to her and try to make up for it. None of them had to spend a weekend trying to console a five year old that was sure she had done something to make her aunt hate her. I originally felt justified but with everyone on her side I am having second thoughts so AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: She never gave me a reason for excluding her at the last minute at the time. I hung up on her when she tried to explain after the honeymoon and neither of us have attempted to contact each other since.

The people calling me an asshole are my parents and other siblings of which I have many.

&#x200B;

Edit2: While I didn't respond to many comments I did read them all. So let me say message received and I'm definitely being an ass for not even hearing her out. I'm going to try and meet up with her later today and let her say her piece. 

Also I asked my daughter and she obviously has forgiven already. She is super excited to go see auntie so It's probably time for me to let it go regardless of what her actual explanation is."
"AITA for flipping out on my brother after he took advantage of my OCD? | I (14M) have an OCD. I've developed it during my fantasy days when I was very young and it's a bit of a strange and silly one, so please don't ridicule me on it. I'll try to explain it.

It's to do with shoes. When I see a pair of shoes for example that are not aligned and in a messed up order, I go out of my way to put them together again, foot to foot. Reason? I imagine an invisible being painfully suffering silently while one shoe is facing one way and the other facing another.

Despite my habit being there for years, no-one in my family has noticed it, or at least....taken advantage of it. Until this morning.

I share a room with my older brother (17M) and when I woke up this morning to find my morning slippers facing different directions, I switched it back to normal and began heading to the bathroom. My brother noticed this and asked about it. I told him about my slight OCD and he began laughing right in my face and calling it ""stupid"".

He was clearly enjoying it, and continued his trolling by throwing his slippers in different parts of the room. I told him to stop being a dick and went to go and put them back. He continued smirking and flipped one over right after I put them right back near his bed.

I didn't change it this time and instead, I flipped out and called him an idiot for taking advantage of this. He casually replied that if it's that serious, I have to get it treated instead of calling your brother an idiot for ""such a weird and silly OCD."" I asked him why he is being so difficult and to stop pissing me off but he waved a dismissive hand and told me to bug off.

This went back and forth for a while before I saw no sense in arguing with my brother and left to begin my morning. My parents say that I'm being way too irrational and I should just let go of my delusions.

AITA?"
"AITA for buying a Watch instead using that money to pay my gf’s medical bill? | I’m living together with my gf and while we share all expenses, we keep the remaining money in our own accounts.

She always earned more than me, which means she always had more money “for herself”, and she has usually been spending all of it every month. (she didn’t spent it ALL for herself but also bought stuff for our apartment or paid the bill for us when we were eating out, but I would say when we go out we fairly split it 50/50, like she pays 5 times and I pay 5 times)

I’m earning less and still managed to put away 4k(!) in the last years as an Emergency Fund, and 1k other Savings. Also got 2.2k tax money, more on that later.

She lost her job at the beginning of this year, now gets the same amount as me every month, which worked totally fine for the first months.

Now since March she became sick and has medical bills of 500€ per month and I already paid this once, and her parents twice. 

I saved money for a new Apple Watch, and wanted to go buy it today. Told her yesterday, she flipped out. Told me I’m TA for getting myself something nice instead of paying her bills when I know she struggles with paying them herself. I told her I already used all the money (and more) I got back from taxes for our 10-day vacation to Greece last month because she couldn’t afford it, but she wanted to go with me and I didn’t want to go alone (of course, why would I take a vacation without my gf when I can afford to pay for both of us?). I told her it’s fine for me that I paid the trip for both of us because I love her, but I can’t use all my savings only for her, because when she earned more than me I always told her she should set up an Emergency Fund!

As I said above *I do* have an Emergency Fund of 4k, but my gf doesn’t know about this and I’m not gonna tell her, because for her that would be free money. She knows I probably have *some savings* but I guess she thinks of 1k or something.

Of course I’m gonna use some of my savings to help her but ...

Reddit, am I TA for wanting to get a new Apple Watch for me?

**UPDATE #1**

Obligatory *”didn’t expect so many comments”* but I really didn’t! Thanks so much everyone, and I’ll try to keep you updated and give you more **INFO:**

I already replied to someone but I want to say it again: My gf is not in debt (and probably won’t be, and I’ll not let her go into debt because that means she wouldn’t be able to afford her half of the rent)

Yes she’s struggling if she’s paying her bills herself. She can’t buy anything else for the rest of the month because of her bills. I paid the vacation because of that. 

Our monthly expenses are still being paid.

It’s a serious three-year-relationship, living together for 1.5 yrs. 

The medical bills are temporary and I expect them to be 100 % paid in December. I’ll have a talk to her about this again, but we’ve always been talking *december is the last payment* and I trust her on that.

**UPDATE #2**

Thanks so much guys, very good comments. What I learned so far is it’s probably *ESH* (and NTA/YTA also looks like 50/50?) and that I’ll have a talk with her about money. 

Also, we love each other. We don’t have big arguments about much other stuff but this one stuck with me as I didn’t realise I *could* potentially be TA for using my savings for myself.

There are no red flags (except this one if you want to call it a red flag). She’s a lovely woman. We’re not gonna break up because of this.

**UPDATE #3**

I’m still rereading the comments because I only had a few minutes of time here and there. 

Looks like the judgement is ***NTA***! Thank you for that, but I see many many good comments saying YTA or ESH and I respect that!

We’re gonna have a talk later this week but I also have made my decision. I’m going to get the Watch either way. That’s what *I* saved for. I know we’re in this situation together but I also know she’s not going into debt, can ask her parents for money, and I still have my Emergency Fund when things get *really tight*. 

Also, this is in Europe. And it’s a real story. I’m not going to disclose any more information but even though health care in Europe is great, believe it or not it still SUCKS for edge cases.

Gonna update once we had the talk.

Thanks Reddit (and please don’t try to break relationships apart)."
"Aita for not being willing to pay for my stepdaughter college tuition | I have 2 boys (21&23) from my first marriage and a girl with my current wife (J). J has a daughter (my stepdaughter V, 18) with her first partner.

My deceased ex wife and  I have created a trust fund for our 2 boys and when she passed away they both got a large inheritance since she came from a wealthy family. 
When me and J got married, she stopped working and is currently a stay at home mom to our daughter (13)

I have 3 trust funds for my children and separate college funds.
I thought V’s dad would be smart enough to do something similar but he currently as 0 savings for V and my wife has none either. 

J and I do have some savings but that is for when I retire.
V asked me to pay for her college but I currently can’t pay for it. I don’t have the money saved up for her. J is upset but understands that I can’t use our savings or my children’s money. 
Its not my fault her dad didn’t save up and I’m not willing to take money from my children.

V now has to apply for student loans and my SIL called me an AH for not paying for her college fee. Whilst I won’t change my decision, I wonder if I’m an AH or not for not paying for V


Edit: I’ve seen a lot of comments calling V’s dad a deadbeat, but that is not the case. V stays with him 3 days a week, he is very much involved in her life."
"AITA for embarrassing a friend on his date because he didn’t pay back the money he owed me? | So I lent a friend of mine £500. He needed it to see him through til the end of the month and promised to repay me on payday. 
Not a problem, I trusted the guy and knew he was good for it. 

Payday comes and goes, no sign of the money. I sent him a message about it. He said “oh yeah, sorry I forgot, I’ll do that now” 

Two weeks pass and still nothing. I message him again. He said he’d send me the money. Still nothing. He was then avoiding me so I wasn’t able to see him face to face. 

I messaged him again and he didn’t reply.

7 months have passed since the day he promised to have the money back to me by. I’ve not been able to get hold of him, nor have I seen him. 

This weekend just gone, I was out at a restaurant and I happened to see him as I was being seated at my table. He was on what looked like a date. 

Now at this point I could see he was acting kinda boasy because he had ordered about 5 starters. It’s worth noting that this is a pretty pricey restaurant. So I decided I’d go and say hello. 

I pulled up a chair at his table and started chatting to him about how he is and how I am etc. 

I then proceeded to pick up a fork and try a bit of the food. He looked a bit shocked, but it was good food so I tried something from one of the other plates. At this point his date (I’d learnt that this was their second date) said to me, “excuse me, but this is our food. What do you think you’re doing?” 

I looked at her and said “Well since I’m pretty much funding this meal, I figured I may as well sample what my money is getting.” 

I then said to my friend, “it was nice to see you, I’ll leave you to it. We can catch up another day.”

I then left to go back to my table. The people I were with, a party of 10, had very mixed reactions to my behaviour. Some were in favour of what I’d done, others not so much. 

So I’m asking you lot, AITA?

"AITA for repeatedly beeping my car in a parking lot to help me find it? | Today I was heading towards my car in a somewhat crowded lot, and couldn’t explicitly make it out. So I pressed the “lock” button on my keys, so my car would give a little beep that would help direct me to it. It isn’t a super loud or startling beep or anything like that.

I kept pressing the button over and over, giving off a symphony of little beeps to help direct me to it. I did this for a minute or more straight until I saw my car. There was an old man getting out of the car next to mine who gave me a really dirty look. He told me that it’s rude and annoying to be making that much noise and that all the beeping pissed him off. I explained that it was helping me find my car, and he just sort of blew me off.

I do this a lot when I can’t find my car and have never been called out by anyone. Is it asshole-y of me to beep my car a bunch, or was he overreacting?"
"AITA for saying no to being an organ donor? | I went to get my State ID today (under 21) and everything was going great until the lady asked if I wanted to be an organ donor. I wasn't expecting the question and I hadn't thought about it, and I honestly didn't know. So I said no.

I understand how important being an organ donor is and how many lives can be saved, but it scared me to think about my insides being taken out and being sewn back up again, even if I was dead. I'm barely 18, and I honestly just don't feel comfortable with it right now (or making the decision right now). I need time to come to terms with.  


It made me feel worse to see that my temporary ID said organ donor on it, even after I answered no. AITA for saying no? AITA for feeling violated? It's my body and someone else made a choice for what will happen to its organs after I die. 

&#x200B;

I'm so conflicted."
"AITA for ""going Karen"" on a teacher at my daughter's school | My daughter is 10 and in 5th grade. She was given 2 days to read 10 pages that were uploaded online and fill out a worksheet. She decided to do it on the second day and worked on other homework the first day. On the second day, a close family friend called me from the ER and asked me to come sit with her while they figured everything out because she was scared. She doesn't have any family around. I took my daughter with me to the hospital because no one was home to watch her and I didn't know how long I'd be gone. It turned out that my friend had appendicitis and thankfully nothing too serious. I tried to open the assignment for my daughter on my phone because she was stressed about getting it done, but the school uses an ancient website and I couldn't get it to work. We didn't get home until late and I told my daughter to just go to bed and I'd write her a note for the homework assignment.

The next day she tells me that her teacher didn't accept her not because he gave the class 2 days, and he said she should have done it the first day. I assumed he didn't realize it was an emergency and not a planned medical procedure so I sent him an email clarifying and included documentation. He responded by reiterating that my daughter had two days to do the assignment and she would receive a zero because it wasn't done. I sent yet another email asking him how she could have predicted a medical emergency and why he gave the kids 2 days to do the assignment if he expected them to complete it the first day. He responded with simply ""my decision is final."" 

I was incredibly angry that this guy was essentially telling my daughter that homework takes precedence over helping other people. I know it's just a zero on a homework assignment, but that's a big deal to a ten year old.

I decided to forward the entire email chain to the principal with an email asking if it was policy not to excuse a 10 year old's late homework for a family emergency. The principal quickly called me and I told her that I would like my daughter's homework to be accepted late and graded and I would like the principal to speak to the teacher about his actions and keep an eye on him for the rest of the year to prevent any sort of retaliation. The principal agreed.

I recounted this to my brother recently when venting about difficult teachers and he told me that from what he was hearing, I sound like the difficult one and that I impeded on the teacher's attempts to teach. He said that I was being a ""Karen"" and micromanaging my daughter's life and oversheltering her and that undermining the teacher was unreasonable and unfair to the teacher. I didn't think I went overboard with it, but now I'm wondering. AITA?"
AITA for getting pissed when my wife whistles to get my children's attention in public. The exact tone you would use to call a dog. | I see this as being on the same level as people put their kids on leashes. It annoys me to no end and she sees no problem with it. 
"AITA for wanting to split everything 50/50 with my GF in our next holidays? | My GF and I are currently abroad on holidays. Usually we try to come up with a budget to spend in things like transportation, accommodation, eating and drinking and so on.

This time however I've been spending a lot more than she has. She paid for the accommodation and I paid for plane and train tickets (way and back for both of us) and for pretty much almost everything we've eaten and drunk and some souvenirs as well (we're currently on our 10th day abroad). It's been that much that my part of the budget it's almost gone, and we're going back home the day after tomorrow.

Yesterday I confronted her after she used our budget to buy some clothes (we kind of established that buying something not strictly related to our holidays should come out of our ow n pockets) and she did not react too well. I was under the impression that she wanted to wait for my money to run out before she kind of took over the financial side of the holidays. 


The problem for me is, she is been making more money than me for a while now and after moving in together a few months ago our financial situation has changed a lot. She knows I need to be careful with my expenses until the end of the year, yet she just kind of let me pay for everything so she could have more money to spend on herself. She went on to say she would pay for everything this last two days but it was in no way a big deal, and I feel disappointed that she failed to see the problem in her thinking process."
"AITA for gifting my best friend a rice cooker? | So yesterday, a bunch of my friends (myself included) got together to celebrate Christmas with each other and we all decided that we should do buy gifts for each other. I pick out my friend who is very well off in comparison to me, so it becomes difficult to find something that he would like or something that may be useful to him.

Fast forward into last weekend, I had no luck finding anything online because everything was getting super expensive almost $50+ so I go to the store and find a rice cooker/steamer pot combo thing on sale for like $10-15. When I bought it, I wanted to be mindful of what I had (I don't have much money myself, I'm a high school student without a job) but wanted to get a gift that he would like, but it ultimately came down to my own limitations which stopped me from getting something that he would genuinely like.

The next day, we all meet and it was time for the gift exchange. I reveal that I was his secret Santa, and proceed to give him the rice cooker. Once he opens the wrapping paper, he is in shock that he has literally just received a rice cooker for Christmas. Everyone around me begins to laugh, and he thinks of it as a joke at first and asks if there's anything else or I had really bought him a rice cooker. He looks and sounds a little salty almost after I told him it wasn't a joke, and I was 100% serious, but he finally accepts it in a sort of bitter way (I think).

So once all the games are played and the food is all eaten, one of my friends drives us home. Only then does it hit me that he has parents who are ""crazy"" (to him) that would blow up after seeing him bring home a rice cooker. He texts me then that his mom asked if I was f\*cking crazy in the head and if I was really his friend in his native language (only used when they are serious) and his dad asked if I could give the receipt back so they could get the cash. It was clear that they both didn't approve of the gift, and once he tells me I sort of play it off but I can't tell if he feels the same way or not. I offered the receipt and to buy him another gift when I saved enough cash, but he said that it was really fine and I had nothing to worry about. Was the rice cooker the right move or AITA?"
"AITA: Fiancee won't insist her coworker gives her +1 to his wedding | So my (40M) fiancee's (35F) coworker (33M) is getting married. This guy has had a crush on her for years. Since before we started dating. We will be celebrating our 6th anniversary next month.

And while he is getting married to his own fiancee, he still has a huge crush on her. He doesn't like me because ""I stole his one true love"".

So I asked my fiancee if I'm invited to the wedding. She said no. I asked her why not and she said she can't force him to +1 me. Which is true. However, I cannot fathom the idea that I would not have been automatically invited. I could understand not +1ing someone's 6-month BF or flavor of the month or something. But my fiancee and I have been dating 6 years. We've lived together 4 years. One of the other FORMER coworkers is invited and she got a +1 for her toddler for crying out loud.

Everyone else in the vicinity has their Significant Others +1ed. Just not me. I've brought this up with my fiancee and she doesn't really want to discuss it. I've told her its offensive that he's not inviting me. We both know why he's not inviting me. Its because he has a thing for her and its a thing he never let go."
"AITA for taking my deceased grandmother’s ring? | My grandmother passed away Thursday night and she left a few things behind. One of those things was a ring that was passed down from her grandmother to her mother then her because she is the oldest granddaughter. My grandmother had the same rule. The oldest daughter gets it then passes it down to her oldest daughter.

Everything was fine and I was looking forward to this because it really is a beautiful ring and I’d occasionally pick it up out of her jewelry box to look at it when I was over at her house. The ring means a lot to me and it’s the only thing I wanted of hers. Back when I was 14, my aunt adopted a 17 year old girl. At the time everything was discussed prior to the adoption (when I was 11), my aunt and her husband only had 2 sons. She told my mom that even though she was the oldest, she wanted my mom to get it then pass it down to me, as she didn’t have any daughters. **My grandmother agreed it was the sensible thing to do and told me I could have the ring.** My mom doesn’t wear jewelry though, so she didn’t care much either way. My mom told me she’d just give it to me when she got it. For reference, I am 21 now and this adopted “cousin” is 24. I am the oldest biological granddaughter.

While everyone was cleaning out different rooms yesterday after my grandmother’s passing (She had Alzheimer’s and was moved to a facility but her home was still cluttered, that’s why we were cleaning out her house so soon after her passing. She also wanted to be cremated and has no living relatives other than her children and grandchildren so we weren’t concerned about planning a funeral), I heard my aunt and her adopted daughter in the pantry talking about how she was going to sneak the ring out of the jewelry box before I could get it since *she* is the oldest granddaughter. I was upset because my aunt promised me I could eventually have it but she changed her mind.

We all went out last night to eat after finishing up some work (we plan on doing a lot of cleaning today too) and I left early and told them that my manager texted me and asked me to come work for a few hours because a co-worker had called off sick and they were swamped. I went straight back to my grandmother’s house and took the ring out and left before anyone could come back. I took it to my apartment and hid it just to be safe. I have no idea what will happen today when my aunt realizes it’s missing.


Edit: My grandmother never said otherwise after the adoption.

**EDIT:** 

**Alright folks, here is what the will says now that I have seen it:**

I bequeath the following items of tangible personal property to the beneficiaries listed below:

Diamond ring inherited from my grandmother: My eldest daughter who is to then place it with her eldest **biological** daughter. *If she should not bear daughters, it shall be given to my youngest daughter instead who is to then place it with her eldest **biological** daughter.*

**There you go. It belongs to ME. Apparently blood ties were important to my grandmother as well since step and adopted grandkids aren’t included. The will was made several years ago after my grandfather passed away and she wanted to have it made just in case something happened to her, before my aunt and my mom had children. It is likely my grandmother simply didn’t remember the will since she had Alzheimer’s.**

Edit: Maybe this edit will make you all chill out. I didn’t know there was a will. I based it off words that had been said to me. That’s why I took it. My grandmother and I were **EXTREMELY** close. I felt it was mine since it had been promised to me and was offended that there was an attempt to actually take it away from me. My mother called me and told me that we were meeting up at my grandmother’s house once again to look over the will she made several years ago. I showed up and my aunt and her daughter (I took *adopted* out since that seems to trigger a lot of you) did as well. They looked very tired and annoyed. When we were reading the will and it came out that my mother is the owner of the ring, my aunt and her daughter began screaming at us and admitted that they were there from 11 PM until 2 AM looking for the ring thinking it had gotten lost somewhere but couldn’t find it. Since my aunt has no biological daughters, it immediately transferred ownership to my mother and she said it now belongs to me because she does not want it since she doesn’t wear jewelry. I told my mom that I already took it and she was upset until I said I overheard my aunt talking to her daughter about how they were going to snatch it up before anyone else got to it. My aunt got pissed with me and told me to never talk to her again. She and her daughter left in tears and told us to finish cleaning up on our own. The ring was the only thing left to me and it was truly the only thing I wanted, so I’m happy I got it. So here I am now, cleaning up the house again with my mom.

**LAST EDIT:** I didn’t fucking come here to be judged about my opinion on blood ties. I came here to be judged about my ACTIONS - whether or not taking the fucking ring was an asshole move on my end. 

It seems most of you don’t realize how simple it truly is the execute a will. The lawyer who helped her was there with us with it in hand - she wanted to ensure it wouldn’t be lost so she kept it stored away. It doesn’t take a year and a half after the death of someone to look at the fucking will to see what the deceased is giving to someone else. My god. 

The ring that is now mine has currently been in the family for 5 generations. And yes, that does matter. Why the hell should someone who was adopted into the family at 17 (my aunt and uncle have had her since she was 16 and my grandmother already had Alzheimer’s) who has no blood ties to the family get the ring instead of the biological descendants??? Explain to me how the hell my “cousin” and I are equal in this instance. She and my grandmother were *not* close. **I** was the one who visited her every day before she entered the facility to help her with chores around the house, not her. And no, I don’t treat her differently but I do view her differently. 

And no, my aunt can’t have any biological children now. She had a hysterectomy several years ago."
"AITA for telling my girlfriend her dream of moving to another country will never happen? | My (25M) girlfriend (23F) has always talked about how it’s her dream to move to X country. She brought it up on our first date (we’ve been together for a year and some change) and has mentioned it practically every other day since. 

At the beginning, I went along with it, told her how cool it would be, we talked about if I would go with her, how crappy our current country is (I’m an expat and she’s a local), etc etc 

Recently, however, every few times she mentions it, I’ll bring up her spending habits. In the time we’ve been together, she’s spent around 8,000USD+ of her own money (plus her credit cards) on a few high ticket items. 

The last time she brought it up we sat down and calculated how much money she’d need to save to get started. 

After we had the number, I started calculating something else. Balenciaga shoes + LV bag + Gucci sunglasses etc etc until we came up with the number she needed to move and told her it’s never going to happen if she keep buying expensive things 

She’s called me TA, that I’m trying to control her money, I’m trying to humiliate her, make her feel “small” and it’s none of my business what she buys, and of course all of her friends are saying the same thing 

IMO she could have made her dream come true long ago, and I was only trying to lay it out for her

AITA?"
"AITA for making my SO kick out his roommate? | Background: me (34F) and my SO (50M) have had an on again, off again relationship for 3 years. First time around my SO repeatedly cheated and lied to me, and it ended when his kids started stealing from me and he found them entitled to take anything that is in their house.

&#x200B;

We got back together again last year, and things were working ok, except that the relationship between his kids and me was broken. We decided to let plenty of time pass before reintroducing me into the family. In January, he took in a new lodger. He usually has lodgers to help with the rent. This time it was a woman my age, a distant acquaintance of ours. He asked for my permission, which I gave because I trusted him and really liked her. Then little things began to happen. Not huge, but together they added up to something that I wasn't comfortable with.

\- One of his best friends, who I also know since 6 years, was having a dinner party and invited my SO and Lodger Girl, not me. The friend had never met Lodger Girl.

\- Lodger Girl starts posting a lot of pics of my SO to insta, often several pics per day.

\- Lodger Girl tells me about how he cooks dinner for her almost every night (SO denies this).

\- On Pancake Day, So and Lodger Girl makes pancakes together with the kids, posting lots of jolly videos of it to instagram.

This is when I get really uncomfortable and feel left out. I tell him how I feel, and ask him to either step back from Lodger Girl a bit, or ask her to move out. He gets really angry and says that he doesn't give a fuck if I'm comfortable or not. That the four of them (kids, SO, Lodger Girl) loves to spend time together and that I shouldn't try to come between that. We have a huge argument.

&#x200B;

A couple of days later, he excitedly tells me that he and Lodger Girl are gonna have a party together, and that I'm welcome to come. I get really upset, which confuses him since he knows I love parties and thought I'd be excited too. We have another argument. A few weeks pass, and his parents are in town. He has a dinner with his kids and his parents, and also the Lodger Girl. I completely loose it upon hearing this, I feel that he overstepped so many boundaries and puts her in the place that should belong to me.

&#x200B;

Now we have started seeing each other again. I am really happy for this, because we are very much in love with each other. He acknowledges that he understands that I felt left out, but explains that he invited Lodger Girl so many times because she was sad and he wanted to take care of her. I can't make out if he was aware that in doing so, he was making me sad. Now, Lodger Girl has blocked me from her instagram, which makes me feel that she's got something to hide even more. I feel that it has gone so far, that I struggle to see another way of me and my SO living together, then her moving out.

"AITA for embarrassing my future father in law | Little background here. I recently got engaged to my long term girlfriend and the woman of my dreams. She’s great in every way but comes from a very different background than me. Here family are relatively old money New York jews. They all went to an elite Ivey league schools and work in white glove careers (Doctors, lawyers, etc). Status is huge for them. My future father in law (ffil) has squandered all of his money but still likes to act as if he’s part of the jet set. I don’t have a problem with this but he does have lots of problems with my background. My father immigrated from Eastern Europe to the US and has worked extremely hard to slowly build up what’s now a massive farm. When I was a kid I doubt my parents ever had more than 1k in their checking account but today the farm that is coowned by my brothers, father, and I makes a significant sum of money every year. I’ve worked since I could walk helping to build the business. When I was 16 I dropped out of high school to work to save the farm from foreclosure. I worked like a slave and put myself through college over the course of a decade at a number of lower tier state schools. I have a very solid white collar job now and with the income from the farm I’m very financially comfortable. My ffil seems to take all of this as a personal insult and makes a point of belittling my family whenever he can. He hates my lack of polish, my poor education, and the fact I’m a gentile. Anyway he always has said he’ll pay for my fiancé’s wedding. He’s even has said this publically in front of his family multiple times while implying my family could never pay. Anyway our wedding will be held at an estate my father recently bought in his home country. It’s a beautiful old castle with elaborate gardens my father has spent a fortune renovating. The only cost for the wedding will be catering which because my side of the family is close to 300 people alone will probably come to 50k (alcohol will be the main expense as the nation is very cheap). My fiancé and I had a nice dinner with her extended family and her father once again wasted no time in pointing out im a useless country bumpkin. At that point I’d had enough and stood up to announce my thanks to my ffil for agreeing to pay for all the expenses for the wedding including the priest who will be officiating (I’ll admit that was below the belt). Despite his act he’s completely broke and can not possibly pay for it all but now will have to or be completely embarrassed in front of his family. My fiancé is livid at me even though she knows he’s agreed to pay for the wedding in the past and that me and my family will be covering most expenses. My brothers who all hate my ffil thought that my ffil had it comming. So AITA?

UPDATE: Based on your advice I’ve apologized to my fiancé for springing on her dad like that. It was a super productive conversation and we made what I think is a fair compromise. I’ll cover the money her dad promised if in exchange he’ll publicly welcome me into the family at the wedding. He and I will also will have to remain curt but civil from here on out. He saves face, my fiancé won’t be stressing about her relationship with her dad, and I won’t dread seeing my new family."
"AITA For calling my boss out in a meeting? | My boss tends to INFURIATE me when he ALWAYS answers questions with another question. Even if it's something simple. I've long suspected he does this to avoid saying, ""I don't know"" and I've talked to him multiple times (privately) about how this frustrates me.

&#x200B;

In a meeting today he had done this about four times in the span on 20 minutes and I called him out in front of everyone. I said, ""You know it's really frustrating when you won't give an answer to simple questions. If you gave us an answer and THEN asked questions that would be fine. But you ALWAYS just ask questions instead of actually helping us, and THAT is your job!"" He then got visibly upset, threw his binder down on the table and left the building. He hasn't come back and this was nearly three hours ago. Am I the asshole for saying something? My coworkers have shown me support after the fact, but I'm a tad worried about my job at this point.

&#x200B;

Edit: Not fired or anything. Had a talk with my boss and we both apologized to each other and he said he will try and not do that as much. Apparently he got in trouble for his behavior during the meeting and the leaving."
"AITA For Splitting Bills 50/50 With My GF Even Though I Make A Lot More? | I'm M28 and my GF is F27 and we've been together for about 2 years living together for the past 6 months. I moved out of my condo about 6 months ago (that I own) and into my GF's place since her roommate was leaving and we agreed to split the rent and utils 50/50. I'm trending to make \~250k this year and she makes about 60k. She can easily afford our rent and utils but recently came to me asking me to pay more of the rent and utils as I make a lot more or for me to pick up the tab on date night more often. We usually split date night or she'll pay for a few then I'll pay for a few. I told her no, a 50/50 split is fair on rent and utils and groceries and I told her I'd pick up the tab on date nights a little more but thats it. She called me an asshole and her sister later messaged me saying I wasn't being a ""man"". 

AITA?"
"AITA for refusing to invite my fiancé’s ex, who he is still friends with, to our wedding? | So my fiancé and I were working on the list of people that we are inviting to our wedding next year, and he wants to invite one of his ex-girlfriends, who he is still friends with. I am not down with that.

I said I don’t want to us to get married in front of the girl who was his gf before me and with whom he had his longest relationship (they were together for 6 years, we have been together for 1). I have met the girl a couple of times, we are civil and I know she is engaged so this is not about jealousy. The idea just feels really weird and uncomfortable to me.

He said that she is part of his friend group and he cannot invite all of their friends and leave her out. He said that she is a part of his life as his friend before and after she was his girlfriend (He lived with her in college and she paid for everything because he was broke from supporting his siblings). He said she does not need to be seated anywhere near the altar where I can see her but he wants her to be there.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: I just want to clarify that she did not pay his tuition fees. She paid for their apartment, bills and food. And that is a lot and I'm glad she was there for him when he needed help."
"AITA for telling my sister to stop “acting” pregnant? | For context, my sister is known to be a huge drama queen. She draws attention to herself for even the most minor things- she’s the kind of person to sob over a paper cut. 

My sister found out she was pregnant three weeks ago. She’s barely in her first trimester. I’m currently locked in a house with her and she’s being insufferable. She is planning her baby shower already and creating her registry.

She has barely vomited, but she’s like “sooo sick”. She doesn’t want to get out of bed cuz her back hurts (keep in mind, she has no baby bump) and expects me and her husband to bring her shit whenever she asks. Yet, she conveniently can walk when she wants to bake. Whenever we eat dinner, she takes a lot extra because she’s “eating for two”. 

I feel like she’s using her child to make everything about her and make us all slaves to her. I have to cater to her because of “the baby,” or my parents get pissed. 

Today she made a stupid joke about her pregnancy at breakfast and I said “we get it. You’re pregnant. You can stop playing it up so much”. We got into a huge fight, and now it sucks to be locked in my parents’ house with her. I just can’t take it- it will drive me crazy to deal with her extra attitude for 40 weeks. AITA?"
"AITA For blocking an older lady in? | This story happened a few years ago and when I told this story to a newer friend he called us assholes.  

My friends and I used to rent a house in a downtown area that was on a one way street.  The house didn't have a driveway so we would have to park on the street.  We could fit four cars in front of the house.  The house was on the corner lot.  We generally never had any problems.  

Living down the street was an older (55f) lady named ""Gloria"" with her adult children.  She had her own driveway but would occasionally park in the street due to her kids parking in the driveway.  The problem began when she would park in front of our house.  We had no problem with her parking in front of the house but she would park in a way that no one could park behind her due to another driveway.  We could only park one in front of her and if someone parked in front of that car they would run the risk of a ticket for being to close to the crosswalk since it was a corner house.  We asked Gloria at least ten times to be more mindful of how she parked in front of the house yet she still kept doing it.  

Night of the incident.  We came home on a Saturday night and she had parked like that again.  My roommate and I were fed up.  So he guided me to parking within two inches of her back bumper.  I guided him within two inches of her front bumper and then we went inside to go to bed.  Seven a.m. she came and started beating on our door.  (She was an avid church goer) I was greeted with a hail of insults and that we needed to move our cars.  I said ok, shut the door and went back upstairs.  Thirty minutes later a cop was knocking on our door.  He asked us to move our cars and we said sure and walked out to move them.  She was still yelling at the cop about arresting us.  We said good morning to her and he just got in his cruiser and left.  

So, are we the assholes for blocking her in and making her late to church?


Edit: I don't think I've seen so many varied judgements while also agreeing lmao"
"AITA for giving my stepdaughter candy for Christmas but consciously choosing not to give any to my stepson? | I have two gorgeous stepkids, my 15 year old stepdaughter Alex and my 12 year old stepson James. Things are usually.. usually...great in our home, I’m very lucky that I have 2 chill children that have made me feel very welcome. 

Alex is extremely active, she is the golden retriever of the human world. My stepson James on the other hand is a basset hound... both incredibly adorable and awesome in their own way but two very different energy levels and so as a result two different body types. James’s doctor has advised me to change up his diet and portion sizes because he often complains of being tired/ sluggish and the doc would like him to lose some lbs, so I try and stay away from giving James candy and empty calories. 

Both kids got equalish Christmas presents this year- James got a switch and assorted games, and Alex received an iPad. However, for stocking stuffers I ended up giving Alex some candy and I gave my son some lush bath bombs (those things are fricken expensive... and the kid goes NUTS for them) I had a feeling the kids were going to do a trade anyway, which is exactly what they did. James ended up swapping a bath bomb for some candy so he got a little amount anyhow, enough that he was able to eat candy without having surplus stock. 

Now I got a phone call from their mom (who is also usually chill) and she was very upset on James’s behalf. She said that it was unfair of me to give them different stocking stuffers and that I was body shaming him, the list went on and on. I asked her if he mentioned anything, and she replied in the negative but something she said stuck with me ‘don’t think he doesn’t know what youre doing’ ... 

now the kids live with me and dad full time and have for the past 11 years, so I like to think I know our son very well, but I’m worried that I’ve been too heavy handed. I spoke to James about it casually and he was surprised I even bought it up, but I would like some judgement so I can avoid things like this in future if it’s an assholey move... thank you Reddit"
"AITA for telling my son to NOT cleanup the mess other kids caused in a restaurant? | No big deal, but I'm hoping you guys can help put this into perspective...

So we're at a restaurant as a family, wifey, two sons, and myself. It's a decent restaurant, not super fancy but not McDonald's either. We saying at our table and enjoying our meal while some other kids are running around the restaurant. One of the kids throws a straw on the floor. My youngest son sees the scene and immediately friends upon the other kid, then he angrily stands up and goes on to pick up the straw on the floor and puts it on our own table. I told him it was not his responsibility to cleanup someone else's mess in a restaurant and that if some customers are misbehaving is between them and the restaurant manager. My son on the other hand thinks I have an AH mindset, that it was responsible to act, and that he's being a role model. I told him I think that being a role model is to behave properly in the restaurant, not to cleanup the place.

My wife thinks my son is right to cleanup the mess, while my other son thinks like me that this is none of our business.

Minutes before we were talking about this sub and a couple of recent ""cases"" debated here, so my wife suggested I write this post to see what you guys think. So, AITA for telling my son to NOT cleanup the mess other kids caused in a restaurant?

Edit: thanks guys for your comments! While I still think it's the restaurant's responsibility to keep the floor clean, I also appreciate that my son demonstrated a great mindset and I may have hindered this with my feedback. Him and I are actually both prone to cleaning up littering in public places, and I told him I was wrong and he had a great mindset I was proud of. Thanks again!"
"AITA for not wanting to get rid of my dog? | Since June I've been searching for a dog to serve as an ESA at the suggestion of my psychologist and hadn't been able to find the right dog for me, until now. With my roommate's complete approval, I traveled 8 hours to her location and back to adopt the dog I thought was going to be my best friend for life. Apart from some new dog separation anxiety in the form of whining for a few minutes when kenneled, she's been a very good girl for the six days I've had her and has already done well with grounding me whenever my bipolar disorder causes a hypomanic episode.

That was all well and good, until my roommate returned from her parents house (which she visits every weekend) and - a day later - suddenly confronted me with the fact that she's been having an allergic reaction to the dog and that she thinks it's best if I just return her. I offered to buy some air purifiers, suggested antihistamines, and offered to pay for a visit to a doctor if she'd like to try something stronger, but she said she's tried antihistamines in the past and they don't work for her pet allergies and doesn't want to waste a dr's time.

Some backstory: I was originally going to get a cat as an ESA but my roommate told me she is allergic to them, so I decided against that almost straight away. My roommate's parents have outdoor dogs that she's lived with her whole life, however, so we talked about it and both decided a dog was perfectly okay. She was ok with the dog for the first day, up until she started coughing and her hands began itching. Since I've only had the dog the six days, my roommate is thinking it'll be easy to return her since she doesn't think I haven't had time to bond with her. In an ordinary situation, she might be right - I wouldn't know - but I've already started trying to depend more on her as an ESA.

On top of that, I've already spent upwards of $600 on the adoption cost, kennel, beds, toys, food, etc. The adoption agency doesn't offer refunds for adopted animals during any kind of trial period, so in addition to being at an emotional loss, I'm also at a financial loss. Initially, I offered to talk to her foster family to see what might be possible, but the more I think about giving her up, the more I wonder if I shouldn't have to give up the dog, since I invested so much of my emotions and my money into her already. Am I right for wondering if I should think about my own mental health first or am I an asshole for not wanting to return my dog for the sake of my roommate's physical health?"
"AITA Told My Boyfriend to Take Off Anime Style Wig at School | My boyfriend and I go to a Christian University where we must attend chapel three times a week, they are often held in large auditoriums as many students attend. Today I met him for chapel and he was wearing a very cheap looking blue anime-styled wig. His normal hair is brown and short, so this wig was a huge change. It looked like the character Marth from Fire Emblem's hair. I automatically said ""No, no, don't come near me. What are you doing? I don't know you dude, No"". I was laughing while doing this and extending my arm to keep him an arm's length away. He said he was doing a pre-Halloween costume for the day before Halloween, but he didn't have a costume on other than the wig itself. It looked very 'weebish' in my opinion and I  told him to just take it off, being serious for the first time. I said to him ""just take it off, it doesn't look like you are doing a costume it just looks cringy."" He automatically became upset at me and started speaking loudly, making people around us uncomfortable. We were sitting in bleachers with people all around us and he started saying ""are you serious? I'm just having fun. I thought you would actually be a loving and supportive girlfriend and let me have fun."" I stopped talking for the most part when he was getting louder and then when he had stopped I whispered, ""I'm sorry, I guess I'm just not that girl to lie to you, it just looks kinda cringy and embarrassing so I told you, we're in college after all. It's just weird."" He got up to storm out but when I didn't follow he came back and slammed down his skateboard making a large crashing noise so everyone turned to look, all while he was still wearing the anime wig. When he sat back down he said very loudly, ""why are you acting like such a bitch to me? Why are you being a bitch?"" I didn't say anything more and just tried to look forward and listen to the fucking kumbaya that was playing by the chapel band. I later apologized but I feel like I wasn't in the wrong for telling him to just take it off."
WIBTA if I asked girls on tinder for their weight? | There are a lot of girls who i swipe left on because they dont give a body shot on their tinder.

"AITA for not making my wife aware of where I was coming up with the names for our kids. | I’ve lived in the Charlotte North Carolina area since I was 16 and my wife has lived here since her first year of college (we both went to UNCC)


We have kids 3 kids and one on the way.  Matthew (7),  
Hunter and Holly (4). These were names I suggested but my wife loved them where I suggested them and agreed to them without any question. 

We just found out or next child will be female. I suggested the name Charlotte. She said she liked that name but she thought it would be weird to name her Charlotte since we live right outside of it. I said, well what do you think we’ve been doing with the names? She asked what I meant and I pointed out that Matthew was named after the town Matthews, Hunter after Huntersville and Holly after Mount Holly. She got upset and mad that I never made that clear. I said I didn’t mean to be deceive her but she liked the names when I suggested them to her. She told me that I should have told her the reason I liked those names and that had she had known she probably wouldn’t have named our kids that. She said that she now she’s second guessing our whole relationship because of this. AITA"
"AITA for asking my sister to babysit? | I (38F) have two children 11M and 7M

My sister (24F) got pregnant at 17, the baby was delivered and two weeks later passed away of SIDS, the baby  passed away on the 3rd Jan.



She looked after my children while I worked, now shes suddenly refused today.

I had only asked if she would do it since I had a doctor appointment (I'm pregnant) and then work.

She broke down in tears over the phone and refused.

I've since been getting nasty texts from my brother about how wrong it was to ask so close to the date of the passing of her child.

She hasn't shown mourning before this and didn't have a problem other days?

"AITA for getting upset at my wife's question? | This happened yesterday and I wanted to see if I was being a jerk.

Context/Background:

* My wife and I have been married for a few years
* She was previously engaged for several months but then her fiance called off the wedding, so she was never married to him
* She had an engagement ring and they were in the middle of planning and had already put down some deposits on venues before he called it off (just to give an idea of how far along they were in the process)
* Last bit of context. After we got married, she had some skin issues and couldn't wear her rings for a bit. Now she is able to wear her engagement ring that we bought together. However, not her wedding band.

With that out of the way. We are in the midst of moving and as part of that she came across her old engagement ring and wedding band from her previous fiance. She kept them, and her plan was to give the engagement ring to her daughter once she is 16yr old, so she was showing it to her.

The wedding band was also there and she said/asked: 
""Oh, this is convenient. I haven't been able to wear my other band for a while now, would you be ok if I just wore this one instead?""

I was very taken aback by the question. It seemed like a weird question to ask if she could wear the wedding band that she was going to wear for her prior relationship vs ours. She could see the look on my face, so she back-tracked a bit and said: ""...orrrr maybe not"".

I said something along the lines of, ""no, I wouldn't be comfortable with that and honestly, I can't believe you would even ask a question like that? What makes you think it would be ok? It was a really weird question to ask frankly""

So yea, we had a fight about it. He point of view was:

* She had never worn the ring at all, and hadn't even looked at it. It came with the engagement ring (a buy one get one free) and she doesn't place any emotional significance in the band. The engagement ring she does cause she did wear it. She said I was placing the emotional significance on it vs her. The ring is a complete non-item to her hence she was ok with wearing it now.
* I tried to make the point that it was hard for me to separate the band from the previous relationship and the fact that it is called a ""wedding band"" not like, ""random trinket with no emotional significance"". Also, because I was so upset, I said, ""the question felt like you coming to be and saying, hey, is it ok if I sleep with someone else"". A bit of hyperbole on my part, but like I said, I felt upset and kind of betrayed.

We ultimately agreed that we will go buy her another band together. But she was still not getting that it was a weird question to ask. I know that I overreacted a bit with the whole, ""it was like you were asking me to sleep with someone"" but at the same time isn't it a weird question to ask? 

So that's my question, WITA for getting upset by her question to wear the previous wedding band?

Edit: Thank you all for the feedback. I was already thinking that I over-reacted. It was fine that she asked, it was fine that I felt weird about it and wasn't ok with it. Arg, I'm disappointed in myself for escalating like that vs just saying, ""yea babe, that's kinda weird, I'd rather you not. I'd love to get another band together though.""
Thanks again, appreciate the honest critique."
"AITA for being upset that my gf wants to go on a camping trip with 3 single guys and 2 single girls in the Rockies? | I wasn’t invited.  She just told me one day that she was going to go to camping in Colorado with a group of people I’ve never met and when I asked if I could go she replied, “I guess, if you want to. I just didn’t think you’d be interested.”  Then I made some comments about how it was weird how she wanted to go camping with a bunch of single guys who I’ve never met and thus don’t know whether to trust.  She compares it to a bachelor party I went on without her to lake of the Ozarks with 10 of my high school guy friends (all but one were in relationships).

Update:  girlfriend cancelled going after I told her I would go too.  She admitted she didn’t want me to go but says it’s because she wants to develop her own friendships and not be joined at the hip.  She stated that guys and girls can be “just friends,” and that I had nothing to worry about.  I love her and want to trust her but I just don’t quite understand her not wanting me there.  In conclusion I suppose I just need to take her word for it and have faith in her despite not understanding why I wouldn’t be invited."
"AITA: I don't want my wife to go on a trip with her friend who cheats on her husband? | I have been married for 10+ years and my wife's good female friend is an alcoholic. My wife is not an alcoholic but is a binge drinker when she goes out drinking. Her guard is down when drunk and between her and her friend there is very little responsibility taken because both can egg each other on.

&#x200B;

Years ago we went to visit her friend out of town and her friend brought back a man to her apartment after bar close. It was awkward.  The next year my wife went alone to visit her and I just found out the friend brought back a different man and ended up sleeping with him while my wife was there. My wife said she didn't do anything and left the next morning but it was uncomfortable to hear. The friend is since married and cheats on her husband.  She thinks her husband is an asshole (he is very controlling) but instead of working through it she resents him and goes out to have fun however she wants.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now. We have a few kids and my wife is stressed out a lot. I'd like her to do anything that helps relax her. Her friend wants to go to New Orleans on a girl's trip just the two of them and my wife is debating if she should go.  I don't try to be a controlling husband but based on the friend's past choices and my wife's inability to stop drinking when going out make me a bit uncomfortable. I don't think my wife would proactively cheat on me but I don't think her alcoholic friend who brings random men back would be a good influence on her, especially when she admittedly gets way too drunk.

&#x200B;

I don't mind if my wife hangs out with a group of friends (the majority have children, etc) but this one friend has made poor decisions in the past. I don't really want her to go but I'm not sure how to bring up these things without disparaging the friend. AITA if I tell her not to go on a trip with her promiscuous friend to New Orleans?

&#x200B;

EDIT - It's very interesting t o read half the comments saying it's right to honestly talk to my wife about my concerns about her friend and half saying I'm an asshole for caring about what her friends do.  Life has very diverse opinions."
"AITA for feeling entitled to a flight voucher that an airline gave to me? | My older sister, Jean \[29F\] took me \[20F\] and most of my family (mom, dad, & brother \[17M\]) on a family weekend trip to Miami last January. Jean makes a lot of money ($100K+) and doesn't have any real bills because she still lives with my family, so affording a trip like this isn't an issue for her. 

When Jean booked the trip, she did not ask me first if I wanted to go. She knew that I would've said no because she knows I don't have fun on family trips. Jean didn't want to be alone with our brother and parents, so she pretty much gave me no choice. Its not that I dislike my family, but my parents are very overprotective and religious & I don't find them very fun to be around. I also have another sister, Lea \[24F\] who wasnt going, & I was bummed about that bc I'm close to her.

At the end of our trip, we were at the airport getting ready to leave. Our flight was extremely delayed which was annoying. When the next flight arrived, they announced that the flight was overbooked. My family was asked to stay in a hotel for one night & take the next flight in the AM, and in exchange they'd give us each a $175 flight voucher that we'd have to use within one year from the date it was given to us. We agree and accept the vouchers.

Fast forward to now, and we still haven't used the flight vouchers yet. My sister Lea and I are currently talking about going to Orlando this October because thats the only time she can take days off of work for the rest of the year. I told her we should use the flight vouchers to save some money. I'd use mine, and she can use one of our parents'. I texted Jean and asked her if she could email me my voucher code, and if we can use one for Lea because there's only a few months left til they expire, and my parents dont seem to be planning any trips anytime soon. Jean replied and said that she wanted to use the flight vouchers to go on another family trip (without Lea again) in December. I told her that they can go without me, but i'd still like her to send me my voucher.

Jean then tells me that all of the vouchers belong to her because she paid for the flights. I told her that I think I should get one voucher because even though she paid for our flights, the vouchers were given to us to compensate us for our time that was wasted at the airport. She then says that only her & our dads time were wasted because they had to take the day off of work the next day, and I had no work or school the next day therefore my time was not actually wasted. I don't think that makes her time more or less valuable than mine. She kept saying ""I paid for the flights, the airline made a mistake so they refunded me my money in the form of these vouchers!"" I don't see it as a refund though, if it were a refund they would've just credited the amount back to her card.

She knew I wouldnt have wanted to go, but she made me go with them for her own selfish reasons. Now I feel like I should at least get a flight voucher from all of that. AITA for feeling that way?"
"AITA for telling my sister's secret to my husband? | My sister recently informed that she is undergoing surgery for a possible breast tumour and asked me not to inform anyone. They think at best she is Stage III.  This was a real shock and I wasn't able to hide it from my husband when he came home later, and he asked me directly what was upsetting me and I told him. Flash forward to two weeks later and I was talking to my sister and it came out that I told my husband. My sister was pissed, accused me of betraying her and said she never wanted to talk to me again and that she wished that I'd been the one diagnosed. She then told everyone else in the family that I had blabbed her secret but failed to mention it was to my HUSBAND. I've received texts and calls from upset family but I haven't corrected them, I feel I've said enough and anything at this point is bound to make things worse. Bottom line, I feel like keeping secrets from my husband is not a good idea for me... But... AITA??"
"AITA for thinking my husband should give me a better gift than he gave our girlfriend? | Context: my husband and I have a girlfriend of about 3 months. She is/was my friend prior to being in a relationship with us. Also, if you want to be judgy about my situation, move along. 

So for Christmas my husband and I agreed to exchange small gifts, we are taking a trip for our birthdays at the end of January. That’ll be where our “real” gifts come into play. We have 3 children and agreed that the focus will be on them because we are doing this fun adults only trip in a month. 

We have a girlfriend. She has 2 kids and has been in a bad spot for about 7 months. Our relationship with her is newer. We bought her a ticket to come on vacation with us. Hubby and I talked about how that was her Christmas gift as well. 

We purchased some things for her kids and I got all of them some little fun Santa and stocking stuffer gifts (less than $100). Then on Christmas my hubby asked if I had heard from her. I hadn’t. He wondered how she had reacted to his gift. He had bought her $200(ish) boots. I was livid. He had gotten me gifts around $50. —- The trip we are going on is paid for by my work except for the extras which was our gift to one another. We have already spent some cash on a flight for our GF plus she will join in all the extras we buy on vacation. —

"AITA for keeping the tax refund? | I work part time, and do 3 classes per term to get my A.A.S. (half time credit hours) because this is the balance that allows me enough time to study and do assignments, while allowing enough money to reasonably pay my bills. 

My ex and I separated a few years ago, but amicably. We have been doing our taxes married filing jointly to get the maximum back. We live separated. We have always split the refund as it usually only gives us a few hundred each.

The issue is- this year it was noticed I have never claimed an education credit- doing so bumped the tax refund to over 4k. This is a one time credit for the basis of going to college.

My ex believes since we have always split the refund before- we will this time as well, endowing him with a little over 2k (when his refund alone would only be a few hundred otherwise). I could pay off several of my school loans with this money, and I'm debating if I should keep most of it (as it was for MY college- that he did not help financially for). 

AITA if I keep the money?

"AITA for kicking my wife out of the house after she called CPS on my sister. | so my sister has 5 kids under the age of 13, the 8 year old girl and 4 year old boy are currently sick and so the house is a mess due to the fact that she can't clean it.

me and my wife came over to drop of some soup and shopping and we where going to take the other 3 kids out for a fun afternoon, we get there and the house was definitely messy. 
clothing littered everywhere and dishes where not done, I shrugged it off and knew that my sister would get it done eventually. 
my wife thought differently and decided that she would call CPS on her for neglect, I was the most mad I've ever been and told my wife to get out of the house and stay with her mum for the time being. 
my wife knows that the kids are sick and knows how nicely she keeps the house. 

I basically told my wife to fuck off (I was pretty angry as my sister was a complete mess over the phone)

There is a lot more context to add but 3000 character limit got me big time. I fully understand this is 100% my Father’s money and I am not entitled to a single cent. However, I am quite bothered by this. Knowing my dad he sees it as being fair and just wants to “do the right thing”. Personally, I could understand leaving a portion to my step brother but to have him equally listed is bothering me pretty bad. I’ve mentioned it to my older brother and he was very upset about it and wanted to confront my dad. I told him that would be inappropriate and we should respect his wishes. But that doesn’t change how I feel and I am hurt by this.

Am I remotely justified in being bothered by this or am I just an asshole?"
"AITA for not telling my sister that her fiancé is cheating on her? | My sister and I don’t have a good relationship. We fought a lot growing up but idc about that. What I care about is that I let her borrow $4k a few years back and she has yet to repay me. In fact the last couple of times I asked her she flipped out on me and told me she’ll pay me when she has the money. About a year ago she and her fiancé went to Disney world for a week. I asked her how the trip was and she flipped out and accused me of trying to make her miserable because my life is miserable. After that I stopped talking to her completely. I wasn’t even invited to her wedding which is next year. I’m ok with not going. I’ve made peace with not having her in my life anymore. I’ve made peace with never seeing that $4k ever again. I feel happier that I stopped caring.

Anyways a few days ago a friend of mine messaged me on Facebook. It was odd because we haven’t spoken in years. He asked me if it was cool if he could call me. Again I thought weird but said ok. He calls me and asks me if my sister is still engaged to “Tim” and I say yes. And then he tells me he saw “Tim” on a date at the restaurant he works at. He has my sister as a friend on Facebook as well so that’s probably how he recognized him. 

Anyways I haven’t told my sister and don’t plan on it. She screwed me and doesn’t want me in her life so I felt it wasn’t my place to say anything. Does this make me an asshole?"

"AITA for making my husband walk 2 hours home because I was angry? | My husband and I have 3 children, 1 years old, a 6 month old baby and a 9 month old baby we adopted 

I told husband I had to go somewhere (two hours and two changes by train) won’t go into details as to why it was so important for me to go - but it was urgent.

I had 4 heavy bags with me too so I asked my husband to leave the car so I didn’t have to get the train with 3 children and heavy bags 

Which if anyone doesn’t know how hard handling 3 babies and heavy bags are - * it is damn hard and stressful*
Well husband took the car out to his friends 

So on the way back home I stopped off and asked for the car keys, he said yeah and didn’t ask many questions 

Three hours later and he texts me to pick him up from his friends 

I said no, walk it - he started getting all angry “don’t be childish etc” “don’t try and joke”

Needless to say he walked.

Husband is completely upset with me and calling me TA for being so vindictive

"AITA for asking my pregnant wife to be responsible for her own infection | TL;DR at the bottom.  
Wife (37F) and I (37M) just got into a small argument and I'm not sure what to think ATM.  
My wife, who is 32 weeks pregnant, has had an ear infection for the past couple of weeks. She can't take regular antibiotics, as they could harm the pregnancy, so she has to put Polydine in her ear twice a day. She has trouble putting in her ear herself, so I do it for her. She has been complaining her ear isn't getting any better, but she also hasn't been consistent with the Polydine. She forgets and doesn't make time for it. I remind her occasionally, but it's not enough. Note - it does seem to improve if she sticks with the twice-a-day plan.  
Last night she asked me to put a reminder on my phone to remind her to use the Polydine twice a day. I said OK, but only if she does as well, since she's the one who needs to be responsible for this. She said OK.  
Which brings us to this morning - She gets out of bed, and says she has to go to the doctor (regular checkup). I told her right away that we need to put the Polydine in her ear first, and she says she doesn't have time, since she's in a hurry will be closing soon. She then continues to ask me if I put a reminder. I told her no, and she sounded disappointed in me. I asked her if she did, and she said she didn't either. I got angry and told her that I'm glad to remind her and help any way I can, but she has to take responsibility for her own health. This can't be completely on me.  
Now for her side - she says that since she's pregnant she has a lot on her mind, like taking needed vitamins and whatnot. Since she needs me to do it anyway, I should be responsible for it and that I'm only acting out of ego.   
I feel this is childish. As I said, I will help, I will remind her (as I did this morning to no avail), but she can't throw her responsibilities on me. This seems basic to me - you're unwell, you do what you can to feel better.  
So reddit, I'm at your mercy - AITA? 

TL;DR - My 32 week pregnant wife has an ear infection, and is insisting that I remind her when to take her medicine instead of taking responsibility for herself. This may be a slightly unfair TL;DR. Get the full picture by reading the complete post.

Note: I know, this isn't a big marriage-threatening ordeal, but this just happened and I would like to know if I'm dense and this is a legitimate request, or if this is a little too much."
"WIBTA if I asked my SO to get me a new engagement ring when re-proposing | Obligatory “first time posting, on mobile, etc” disclaimer

TL:DR- I’m contemplating asking my SO to purchase a new ring when he’s ready to be engaged again since the original ring reminds me of current hurt and pain

We got engaged & began wedding planning a few months later but soon paused since he started a new job & wanted to focus on that. I suggested eloping since I don’t want a wedding & this would be the easiest/cheapest option. He was on board initially but changed his mind when it got closer to the date. A few months later we began wedding planning again. When it came time to solidify a date & venue he became “unmotivated & unenthused” about wedding planning (his words). He mentioned that we have issues to work on & he wants to resolve this before continuing with wedding stuff

We had a conversation one night about why we’re even engaged, if he’s not ready to get married. We’ve been engaged for 17 months with zero progress towards marriage. I realized that wearing my engagement ring was causing even more hurt for me. Every time my ring knocked into something/caught my eye/etc, I was reminded that he’s not enthused or motivated or ready to marry me. It was getting to be too painful. So I gave him back the ring & said I was done being engaged until he’s ready. I said I still want to be in a relationship & work through his concerns but don’t see the point in being engaged & it’s too hurtful for the constant reminder via wearing the ring

We have been in couples therapy for a few months now & have made some progress. I’m hopeful but feeling concerned about wearing the same ring that comes with all of this baggage & hurt. If we’re able to move forward in our relationship, I don’t want to be constantly reminded of a painful time. I’m contemplating asking for a new ring for when he’s ready

It’s not that I’m looking for an excuse to get new shiny things. I’m not typically a materialistic person. I don’t wear any jewelry, don’t ask for expensive gifts, etc. I don’t want a whole new proposal. I want us to move forward. I know this is a growth & learning experience & maybe the ring could be a reminder of our strength & resilience. I’m just fearful that it has too much baggage associated & it might be better to start off on a better note"
"AITA for telling my fiance off? | So, I (22f) just got home from work and didn't feel like cooking. I just got paid today and have no pressing bills so I wanted to buy a pizza. 

My fiance gets livid. He asks me what happened to me wanting to save and be healthy on top of other issues he brought up. 

I have been saving 100 dollars each pay period. I get paid every week. I have 700 dollars saved. 

I told him to shut up and leave me alone. He got mad and went to bed at 7. I feel bad but at the same time, I feel like he was trying to guilt me into cancelling my order (which I did because I got so angry and lost my appetite).

"AITA for giving 0s to students arriving late/skipping class? | Backstory:

For a calculus course in our college, teacher assistants (TA) help the professor cover lectures. There are 4 lectures each week, but 2 of those lectures only have a TA present. Hope (21F) and I (Emily, 20F) are TAs. Hope runs one and I run the other, and both lectures are without the professor.

Both TA lectures cover how to use a program, MATlab. Both lectures are identical, students can pick which lecture to attend based on their schedule. The root of this AITA post is that even if a student already knows how to use the program, they still have to go to one TA lecture. The lecture counts for 30% of the total grade in the course.

My side (Emily):

Plenty of students in both lectures know how to use the program and lectures are a huge waste of time for them. They’ve started skipping, or coming 1 hour late.

I don’t mind. The students who skip/are late are still handing in assignments. I’m not taking any points off for those students since they’re still doing their work and I understand that the class is wasting their time. They’re paying to attend college, so if they want to skip class, that’s on them. It’s their money and their time, while I’m being paid to teach them. I only grade students based on their ability and on how much they’re improving.

Hope is taking points off for coming in late/skipping. She’s vindictive about it. If a student skips but emails assignments, Hope gives them a 0 for it. During quizzes, if a student takes 30 extra seconds to finish writing something after time is up, they get a 0.

I think she’s being too harsh. The students know the program, but she’s punishing students for reasons that aren’t based on academic merit. I’ve tried telling her this, we keep getting into fights. I think she’s failing students for the wrong reason. I’d understand if she took 10 point off max, but a 0 is too harsh.

Hope’s side:

I know it’s frustrating taking the lecture when you know how to use the program. I’d like to say that this is my 3rd year as a TA and it’s Emily’s 1st.

Part of college isn’t just about academia, it’s also about learning how to be a responsible adult. How to manage your time and be organized. Skipping/being late to obligations will not get you far in life. Being late is disrespectful.

I gave warnings without penalizing anyone when they missed class or were late. I told them that I would give them 0s if they kept it up. The students didn’t listen, so I started taking points off.

Emily is calling me vindictive since she believes that I’m giving 0s to assert my authority over students/scare them into listening, but that’s false. I warned them, they didn’t listen, so I followed through on my words. Actions have consequences.

Calling me vindictive is totally out of line. She has less teaching experience than me, and the way I run my lectures hasn’t been a problem before. She’s the only TA I’ve seen pick a fight out of it.

We’ll accept judgement.

"AITA for being upset with how my girlfriend has acted on the week my mother died. | **TL;DR My mother died this week, my girlfriend started a fight days later over my inability to talk about it, then she ignored my messages for about 40 hours, and is now thinking of cancelling plans to come visit me and my family. I'm a bit stunned because this feels super insensitive considering the stress I'm already under, and is very unlike her. I know that I often don't help alleviate conflict, but in this case, I really don't think I'm in the wrong, so please correct me if I am.**

\----

My GF is British. I live in the UK with her, but I'm in Canada now where my family is from. I should mention that we BOTH have problems letting fights sometimes last longer than they should and allowing things to escalate.

My mom was battling cancer for years and in recent months she took a sharp decline. I quickly came back to Canada to spend her last month with her. During that time, my girlfriend (who is genuinely the most loving and caring person I know) would ask me every day how she was. After a while, this became very difficult to know how to answer, as my mom was barely conscious and the only answer I could give was ""she's dying."" I told my GF to stop asking me because it was difficult for me to answer, and I told her I would let her know if anything major happened. I appreciated her thinking of me, and I'll admit, I was a little blunt in how I said it (I was under stress but it's not an excuse, I know) and she understandably didn't take it well. We got past that though and everything was fine for the next few weeks.

My mother finally passed away last week, her funeral was a few days ago. I called my girlfriend for the first time in a while; we chatted, and eventually she asked me how my family was doing. Again, this was difficult for me to answer, because we're not fine and I just wanted to talk about other things. I gave her a very basic answer and probably sounded like I didn't want to be talking about it. She took this as me telling her off again, which I absolutely was not doing. I immediately clarified and said it was just difficult to answer, but as I previously mentioned, we have trouble letting things go, so she kept going. She insisted I was making her feel stupid. I asked her to please listen to me, told her it was just difficult to answer, and to just drop it and let's move on (considering the circumstances I really didn't want to fight), but she kept going. It then obviously escalated into a full fight. It ended when we had to go to sleep.

The next day she messaged me like nothing had happened, but I felt like she had  crossed a line, starting a pointless fight days after my mother's funeral, when I had begged her to just let it go. So I explained this to her; how it made me feel and asked if she could acknowledge that. The conversation kept going all day, heated at times, but she eventually apologized, and it ended with her telling me she would ""leave me alone."" I didn't ask her to leave me alone, but she then proceeded to ignore my messages for 40 hours (I was no longer trying to discuss the situation, just trying to talk about her day and other regular stuff because she had already apologized, so to me it was over). But ignoring me made me feel awful again, especially considering what I'm already going through. When she finally did respond, she told me she was worried about our relationship and that she might cancel her plans to come out to Canada (I've paid for the flights already).

I still want her to come, and I don't want our relationship to end over this. But I feel like I have to stick to my values here. To me, she's being unnecessarily heated and petty on an awful week for me. If she decides not to come, I feel like that might be the end of our relationship. I do try very hard to be self-critical, so if you all think I'm in the wrong here, need to just let this go or even apologize to her to prevent things from getting worse, then please tell me. Or else am I justified in feeling this way?"
"AITA for spending 20 bucks and threatening divorce when my husband got mad at me for it? | So my husband and I get along pretty well for the most part, considering we've been married 16 years and have two kids.He makes a great salary but is nervous as hell about money.  However, he goes out for lunch on a regular basis and sometimes pays for his coworker's lunches too.  We had an argument last year because he'd told me he NEVER went out to lunch, but then I saw the checkbook and saw that he was going out 2-3 times a week and paying for more than just his own lunch, and of course this was a major problem for me.  Not that he spent money, but that he lied about it.  Water under the bridge.

He usually doesn't mind when I spend money because I am pretty controlled and only buy things I use (like makeup once in a while, or a cheap pair of shoes or something).  I have a part-time job but mostly am a stay at home mom, because he prefers it that way.  But I'm starting a new job soon where I will be working a couple of days a week and bringing in more money.  Not because he wants me to, but because I want to.

We just had to replace our heating system which was about as expensive as buying a new car, and my husband is freaking out.  He looked at the checkbook and saw that I had spent 20 bucks on ebay.  20 frickin bucks.  And he got mad at me.  Slammed the door and everything.

He apologized, and realized that he was overreacting.  I was pissed though.  I threatened him with divorce....I'm not sure if I was serious, but I was pissed.  He says my reaction to his stress was extreme.

Which one of us was the asshole?

&#x200B;

Edit:  I miscommunicated what happened.  He flew off the handle first.  Then I said ""Do you want to divorce me?  Then you won't have to worry about me spending money"" and then he apologized and then coffee."
"AITA for how I reacted to a passenger's death on a flight? | In the moment, I already knew it wasn't an appropriate reaction, but I'm starting to worry it might properly be an assholish reaction.

&#x200B;

So, yesterday, I was on an hour-long flight, as the final part of a day-long journey. And on this flight, a person died. I won't say I ""discovered"" him, but I was the one to figure out that he'd passed on.

About twenty minutes into the flight, I noticed a hunched-over old guy (eighties, maybe) heading to the bathroom; his hand opposite to me wasn't fully visible, but I think he was holding his hand against his chest or something. Definitely something to notice, but it was a half-distracted glance before resuming what I was doing.

I needed to use the bathroom, so I kept an eye on it to see when he'd come out. There was another bathroom on the plane, but it was on the other end and much more of a hassle than waiting a few minutes for him to finish up.

After something like ten minutes elapsed, I started to get a bad feeling. I quietly got the attention of a flight attendant and explained seeing an elder gentlemen who seemed to be holding his heart had gone into the bathroom ten minutes ago and hadn't come out.

I didn't see all of what happened, as the second flight attendant was (perhaps deliberately) blocking the view to the bathroom, but there was a page for medical personnel and the bathroom remained out of order for the rest of the flight. And the guy never resumed his seat, made all the more obvious by the fact this was a fully-filled flight with a now-empty aisle seat.

And as horrible as it is, I admittedly became angry at his death. It's so utterly stupid, but I kind of felt like he screwed all of us. Had he told a flight attendant as *soon* as he felt unwell, we could have turned around and maybe had a thirty minute delay and given him the medical attention needed. Instead, there was this eerie realization that someone had died filling the plane. All of us on this flight had to deal with his death. Just because he couldn't be bothered to take care of his health issues.

And it's fucking stupid and dumb I know. It was probably inevitable and he probably didn't even realize the gravity of the situation. But I'm still angry.

Maybe it's because I've lived in an area where people commonly use public transit to off themselves that I'm feeling this. Maybe it's my thing against preventably inconvenient deaths developed by this trend. I don't know.

I don't know if I'm the asshole here, and it's eating me up because I don't even want to talk about this until I figure out how people will read my reaction.

So, reddit, am I the asshole?

&#x200B;

Edit for clarification, since it has been brought up: I've never expressed any of this to anyone, nor did I speak to anyone on the plane about the way I was feeling. The only people who know about my thoughts regarding this are myself and the people who have read this post.

Edit 2: I hope this doesn't count as not accepting my judgement, but I want to make it clear I've heard all of you guys who have said I'm the asshole. And I understand it. I'm currently in the process of seeking out a therapist to work through the way I reacted/felt; I've come to realize it's anger at myself that I'm unfairly directing at the deceased. 

And since it's pretty clear that this will ultimately end with a YTA mark, I want to ask people to just upvote the top comment instead of reiterating how much of a terrible person I am. It'll probably prove that I'm a horrible, selfish person, but some of the comments are a bit extreme and now that the emotions are mellowing from the experience, it's honestly fucking with me to get a inbox full of insults and unfair assumptions. My brain chose the wrong emotion and I fucked up; I get it."
"AITA for not giving my ex her Christmas Present? | For Christmas I got my girlfriend two tickets to see one of her favorite artists in May. I never printed the tickets, only the digital receipt, so I still have the actual tickets in my possession. We long distance dated for three months and I broke up with her roughly a week ago because I didn’t see the relationship going anywhere. It honestly should’ve never started in the first place. She also has a horrible princess complex and has never been told “no” in her life. I actually found out I was the first guy to ever dump her. She hasn’t been taking it well, and for the past few days she’s been sending a LOT of derogatory texts.  She also keeps demanding that I “owe her” the concert tickets. I understand she’s going through a bit of an emotional roller coaster right now, but with all the nasty things she’s said to me I don’t feel inclined to give her the tickets. So Reddit, am I the asshole?"
"AITA for getting jeans banned for women by asking about the dress code? | I (26M) recently started a new job. The dress code is pretty straightforward: clean closed toed shoes, something nicer than a t-shirt, and something nicer than jeans. 

After working a few days, I noticed several of my female coworkers wearing jeans, which is explicitly against the dress code. Now I didn't in any way want to stop them from wearing jeans, but if they could do it, I wanted to do it too, as jeans are more comfortable than slacks imo. 

So I went to the boss and asked what the actual policy on jeans is. He said the policy is no jeans. When I asked about the women wearing jeans, he said they were allowed because they ""aren't sagging or baggy and are a dark color"", which was accurate. However, because I can't just let things go, I pointed out that I own jeans that also meet those requirements, so could I wear them too? He eventually said something along the lines of ""no, men can't wear jeans here"". And because I still can't just let things go, I pointed out that that's technically gender discrimination. 

A day later, boss announced that the no jeans policy now applies to everyone, and now several of my female coworkers are angry with me. Like I said earlier, I wasn't trying to get their jeans banned, I just wanted to be allowed to wear mine. AITA?"

"AITA for denying goody bags to kids? | My 7 year old daughter had a party today and twelve kids showed up. Only six had RSVPed. Anticipating only six kids, I ended up not having enough goody bags for everyone so I didn’t give them to the kids who I didn’t know were coming. 
I thought about simply not giving any, but my daughter was really excited about putting them together and handing them out. She worked hard on little cards saying thank you for coming and really put thought into what candies each friend would like, what set of stickers, etc.

"AITA Sharing one computer | So my family only has one computer and my brother and I have to share it. He gets 30 minutes to use it, then I get 30, then he does, etc. The problem is that recently my brother has been playing games on it with his friends more frequently and because of that he asks for an extension on the 30 minutes. For example, he wants 5 more minutes and because of that I want 10 minutes added to my next 30 minutes. Essentially i get double the amount he gets for his extension. My brother thinks i should just get the same amount of minutes he gets and because of this he calls me greedy. Am i the asshole"
"AITA for not wanting my husband in the room while I'm giving birth? | **UPDATE: last night my husband came in and we had a very long, very emotional talk about the day I give birth. I am going to let him in the room, even if I'm still not 100% comfortable, because he really does want to be there while they are being born. Thank you all for your judgements (except for the people who privately sent me a message telling me to burn in hell, maybe go take a look at yourself if you do that sort of thing)**

Now, don't get me wrong, if this was a normal pregnancy during a normal time I'd want his in 100% but... 

I'm giving birth to triplets in about three to four weeks. It's a very high-risk pregnancy. I plan on having a C-section and getting induced if the **babies** doesn't come in 3 weeks. 

The doctor told us that with all the complications, it would be good if I didn't have many people in the room. My husband was on the call when he said that and assumed it meant it would be just me and him. After the call, I explained that with all the complications I wanted it to be just me. This was yesterday and he has locked himself in his gaming room and hasn't left. I am bed bound, so I only got up a few times to ask him to come out. 

AITA for wanting him to wait in the waiting room while I give birth?

**EDIT: (for clarity) 

1. Theres a very high risk one of the babies will come out... Not okay. Honestly, the babies were not planned and it was the result of a broken condom. I had never planned to have children due to medical reasons, but I always wanted one and decided not to abort. 

2. My husband has a history of panic attacks and puked once at the sight of my tapon on the floor once when the dog got everything everywear once last year.**"
"AITA for getting mad at a guy who complained about my car, despite not having a car? | I have an old car, a 1998 Subaru outback, and it's a solid car. I got it in highschool because it was what I could afford and I wasn't expecting it to last too long. But eight years later it's still going strong. I'm a mechanical engineer and I can do a lot of the maintenance and fixes myself now, so it's been really cheap to maintain. It's stick shift which makes it pretty reliable too. 

It's had some accidents, one that dented up the hood before I bought it, one sideswipe from a drunk driver that just caused cosmetic damage, one time it was rear ended on a snowy day and I had to replace the back panel of the bodywork. 

It looks well worn too, someone who owned it in the past must have been a chain smoker because there's plenty of little burn marks and discoloration.

But it's mine, it's special to me, I call it my adventure wagon and have taken it traveling all over the country. I know it well and it taught me a lot about maintenance.

Anyway, I work at a techie company in a city, and it's a place a lot of people don't need to drive since there's great public transportation. 

A few of my coworkers, John and Tim, were going to a conference along with me. Our boss thought none of us had cars and suggested expensing a rental car, but he seemed stressed about the cost and was waffling on whether to even send us. Then I said I have a car, I just don't take it to work very often, but I could drive to save the team some money. He said absolutely, and I'd get reimbursed for gas and tolls plus a little extra for wear and tear.

So we got going to the conference in my car. John, who's a friend of mine, had no problems with my car. But Tim, who I don't know too well, but I know he tends to ramble on about stuff, just started complaining, and complaining, and complaining.

The car was so dented and scratched... It smells funny... The seats aren't comfortable... there's no air vent in the back... Why won't the window open... How old is this thing anyway... It shakes when it goes... Is this as fast as it'll go... It does not shift smoothly... Is this a burn mark here... You're using a casette??? I want to listen to something else...

I was getting annoyed, and I didn't really acknowledge his rambling and turned up the music. He started complaining about how shit the speakers are.

I turned around and was like ""tell me about your car? Oh right, you don't have one. Don't complain if you don't have anything better to offer."" 

He said that he didn't get one because he took the subway, but if I was gonna have a car, why didn't I get a decent one? Mine seemed like a death trap, it was noisy and uncomfortable, 

I said that it was a normal car and he was acting real entitled for someone who didn't even have a car, like he could talk after he got off the subway and started driving.

The rest of the drive was super awkward and quiet.

AITA for being so annoyed?"
"AITA for telling another kid why my kid doesn’t do all the homework? | My 12 year old daughter had a sleep over with a friend Friday night.

The other mom asked me to make sure her daughter got a start on her homework because they’d be at a wedding the rest of the weekend. 

While the girls were working it came up that my daughter doesn’t do all the homework. 

She’s in one of these pressure cooker school districts where her assignments totaled up to 4-6 hours per night. After having been in school all day. 

So she only does however much necessary to learn of complete projects then when it seems like busywork she stops. 

This is fine and even encouraged by me. I want her doing other things besides school and experiencing the world. She’s excelling in her classes. So I’m unconcerned. 

The friend was flummoxed by this as she comes from a particularly academically rigid household. She asked why I don’t force my daughter to do all the work.  

I explained in 12 year old terms that studies suggest homework has diminishing returns after a certain point, some of the things they learn aren’t particularly useful or relevant, and she does well. 

Anyways the girl goes home and the next time she has homework she tells her mother the things I told her. 

Now her mother says I’ve caused a massive fight in their household and disillusioned her daughter and that she can’t come over anymore because my daughter is a bad influence. 

Should I have just shut up here?

"AITA for not cooking my wife's favorite food anymore? | My wife and I have been married for 6 years and together for 10. She has a job that requires her to work a lot of hours, while my job is more flexible and lets me telecommute most days, so we have an arrangement where I do the cooking, dishes and some of the cleaning, and she handles the other chores on the weekends. I enjoy cooking and I like to think I'm decent at it, so I'm fine with this.

Anyway, on to the issue: two months ago, after a lot of reflection, I became an ethical vegetarian and have since cut meat completely out of my diet. My wife was initially very hesitant about this change, but we eventually agreed that I would cook us vegetarian base dishes and she could heat up some frozen meat products from our freezer in the microwave if she wanted more protein to go with her meal.

For some background, when we first started dating, I really wanted to impress her and cooked her a really fancy meal for our third date, including a steak dish that she really liked and decided was her new favorite food. She requested the steak for her birthday and other special occasions, and up until I became vegetarian I was happy to make it for her.

Fast forward to today, when we were discussing plans for her birthday next Thursday. She said she wanted me to make her a steak again, as usual. I explained that I'm no longer comfortable with that because I don't cook meat anymore, but I'd make her any vegetarian dish she wanted. She didn't like that, so I suggested I take her out to a restaurant where she could order steak off the menu. She got extremely upset and said that wasn't the same at all because it wouldn't be me cooking it for her and that was what made it special. She said I should be willing to make an exception for her birthday and it was something she looked forward to every year.

I understand where she's coming from but I also think she should respect my beliefs. I'm open to judgment either way."

"AITA for being mad about an eaten pizza? | My nephew, 14, spends every Monday evening at our house. I usually cook something delicious and unhealthy for the three of us (my husband included). Lately though we have been having some very serious financial struggles. I happened to have a university exam this Monday so I was exhausted and didn’t want to cook. We decided to spoil ourselves and order some pizza. It’s 20$ for 2 big pizzas. A little expensive, but it’s usually enough for at least 2 meals, sometimes even 3 (if its just the two of us). We had all eaten to our complete fullness and there was still half a pizza left. Knowing my nephew, I HID THE PIZZA. Yes. You read that correctly. 

This morning I woke up, salivating about the leftover pizza. It was still enough for both my husband and I. I arrive at the kitchen and what do I see? The pizza box at the same place I hid it, but empty. I got mad but thought hey, maybe husband was extremely hungry yet again last night and ate all the pizza. Later on when he woke up, he confronted me about eating all the pizza.. and that’s when we realized my nephew had eaten it all before my husband went to drop him off last night. 

My husband was furious. He let my nephew know we won’t be buying pizza again. My sister-in-law started bombarding our phones that we are unfair towards her son and his growing and ever hungry organism. 


I already give them a lot of food every week. Anything I have left over and I also buy them some things too. This was turning point. AITA for being so mad over eaten pizza?

EDIT: All three of us ate the pizza. Not even an hour after eating with us, nephew had finished the pizza I had hid in the top counter over the fridge. I never specifically said “do not eat the pizza” but I did not think that not even an hour later, he’d finish the pizza that he was not supposed to find.

EDIT #2: The issue is guys, he *knew* he wasn’t allowed the pizza. This is a recurring issue and I have previously told him AT LEAST 5 times “if there’s anything you see and want to eat, please ask me first”. In this case I didn’t because I didn’t think that in less than an hour, he’d go and finish the pizza, after I had asked him whether he’d eaten to be full. I always make sure he ate well and is full. I still hid the pizza just in case. As we can all see, useless. At 14 years old, when not in your house, you should already know not to touch other people’s stuff. His mom (my SIL) is very iffy about me “educating him” so I try not to “educate”.."
"AITA to be creeped out by how a waiter treated my daughter and for making her say thank you? | During a long road trip I stopped off with my 4yo daughter for dinner at a family run rest stop type café/restaurant we’ve been to many times before. My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.  

She’d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking.

A bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she’d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she’d been pretty funny.

When he brought the food over though he didn’t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her “do you know you are really beautiful?” She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn’t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said “the man is talking to you” he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. 

I was uncomfortable for a few reasons: 

I didn’t like his tone or the look on his face, I’ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman

It’s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice “beautiful” inappropriate

I made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable 

&#x200B;

Later on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn’t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it’s their secret and not to tell mum.

I feel like I witnessed the first time my daughter was noticed by a creep.  

&#x200B;

AITA or is it impossible for a man in his 50s to talk to a little girl anymore?  

Also did I let her down by making her thank him when I thought he was being a creep?

I’m a single mum but her father who has an active role in her life thinks I should complain to the restaurant.

"AITA for asking my 19 yr old daughter to talk me through her nasty texts to me before I let her borrow my car? | Recently my son flipped out on me and cussed me out and yelled because I was cleaning up some of his things on the porch (mentally he cannot abide change). He reached out to his big sister for support (she lives remotely), and she got so wound up about it, that she texted me. She took his side, and sent me nasty texts, calling me manipulative, that I lie, that I should take my title as mother and jump in the lake. 

Her texts were really hurtful, but also two-faced. She was nice and polite when I paid $1,000 the week before to have her seen by a medical specialist. She was grateful, but suddenly I am the complete bad guy in her books. 

I didn’t understand how and why she jumped to these conclusions about me, and told her that text is not the way to do this. Then she asked to borrow my 2nd car that she used a lot before she moved away to college. When she returns she typically uses it. So, she asked me to use it again this week to travel to a place two hours away for a very important job interview.

I said yes, sure, but you’re going to have to discuss your texts with me, because I can’t interpret what you mean by just reading them. It’s confusing to me - why is she polite to me, yet terribly nasty when it comes to text? She refuses to clarify anything. She’s calling it emotional blackmail and that she should get use of my car without having to explain herself to me. 

I gave her the analogy that your friends wouldn’t let you borrow their car if you said nasty things about them. She didn’t understand that I had boundaries too. 

My daughter did reveal last month that she blames me for a trauma she suffered that I never knew about. And she has told me that she won’t tell me about the trauma until she’s ready to. I respect that. But I think her recent opinion about me in her text is wrapped up with this trauma. She flat out refuses to explain her texts and now I am a bad and unsupportive mother again (who will pay her another $250 next month, and every month to help her out with college expenses). She has always been secretive, and while I thought she was a quiet self contained kid, she was cutting and drinking and hiding all her emotions from me. 

So, AITA for “making her talk” before she can use my car?

Edit: Thanks everyone. She got the car, and gave me time. We talked a bit, and her emotions are all noodles around, and needs time to sort through them."
"WIBTA if I decline my twin stepdaughter's request to adopt her? | Wife and I got married as widowers. My late wife and daughter passed away in an accident. My daughter was only 1 when she passed away. My current wife had 3 yo twins when we got married. The girls are 15 now.

So, yesterday when wife and I were watching a movie, she told me that the girls were planning a surprise for me on their birthday. And when I asked her what it was, she told me that they wanted me to adopt them. I was really happy, because it meant that I had done a good job, but unfortunately I cannot adopt them. I'm actually glad that my wife told me that. A surprise would have caught me off guard. 

The thing is, my wife and I had discussed about this when they were young. I made it clear that I didn't want to adopt anyone or have more children. Call it coping up with my daughter's death or whatever, but I've never felt comfortable thinking about it. My wife is now asking me to say yes. 

I've been there for them and I'll always be there for them. I love them but I don't think I'll be comfortable adopting them. WIBTA here?"
"AITA for accepting a promotion without considering my girlfriend’s needs? | I recently was offered a promotion at my job that would entail 4-5 years of training beforehand. I was hand selected for this training. Because of this, I’m planning to dedicate at least 10-15 years at the location I work at.

I should add that my job previously had a lot of fluidity in location and flexibility because there are numerous locations throughout the country that are always hiring and this was never a problem.

The issue becomes the fact that my girlfriend of two years doesn’t want to stay in the same town she’s finishing up college in, that I live in. She wants to move ASAP. 

AITA for accepting this promotion without talking to her about it or should I put my career before my relationship?"
"WIBTA if I stopped handling childcare? | I have two young children. For years I’ve been on track for a VP position at my job. Last summer, my boss told me that my attendance was a concern since coming back from maternity leave & I was in jeopardy of not being chosen for the position.

&#x200B;

After this convo, I told my husband that I need us to start splitting the time being taking off for our children. He agreed that we should and took the day off the next time there was an issue. But since then any time a child gets sick or daycare is closed he rattles off the many things people are counting on him for and marches out the door.

&#x200B;

In Nov. my boss told me that they are hiring someone else for the position because they need someone who can be fully focused on the job. I’m devastated but I understand.

&#x200B;

Last week the person they hired to fill the position gave her notice. I was approached by my boss again, who said that my name came up for filling the position but they want to know if I have things better situated. Our son is at a preschool now (located between both jobs) so I say yes although our daughter is at the same place.

&#x200B;

I don’t want to lose this opportunity. I’m thinking of telling our childcare providers that from now on they need to call dad first and only call me if they can’t get in touch with him. Both places ONLY call me. Also, from now on I want to just leave the house and go to work if there’s an issue (ex. If daycare messages to say their closed, just leaving for work without the kids and telling my husband via text/call that he has to figure it out).

&#x200B;

WIBTA if I did this? I’ll drop them off as I normally would, but from now on any mid-day pickups or cancellations, I’d force my husband to take by not making myself available.

&#x200B;

NOTE- I only take time off for the kids. Part of why so much time is missed is because if a child is sick they have to be out until they are symptom-free for 24 hours (strictly enforced). Also If the daycare owner (only adult) is sick or has to close due to an emergency then we don't have childcare. We don't have family or friends to take them, and our area has extremely long wait lists for other centers (our daughter is on a list and our son got into preschool after a five-month wait). Also, I take my children to all of their ""well visit"" appointments and there are several with an infant.

&#x200B;

OTHER NOTE- My job is more mobile than my husbands.  I'm a graphic designer. When I’m home with the kids I can still usually get work done. My husband can't work from home and works an hour away from the kids. I'm 15 minutes away. Also, we both work FT, but his salary is almost double mine. This promotion would raise my income significantly but he would still make more than me."
"WIBTA if I told my daughter's father to not send her really expensive gifts? | I'm going to try to make this quick and I'm on mobile so sorry in advanced for any mistakes through this. 

My ex and I broke up 2 months after our daughter was born. I tried to keep him in her life but within 4 months he just stopped trying to see her and stopped contacting anyone about her. He has not seen her in 1.5 years now.


He recently got ahold of my mom and asked if he could send her a bday/Christmas gift. I agreed to let him but didn't expect anything to ever show up. Fed ex just dropped off a $300 Disney jeep and I'm kinda mad. He hasn't been around for over a year then randomly sends this super expensive gift and I feel like he thinks gifts like this will make up for his absence.


I want to tell him not to send gifts like that just once a year then disappear. I'd rather him send her small thing's throughout the year because he's thinking about her not a big one just because it's her birthday and Christmas. I feel like it would make me the asshole though cause I'm not allowing my daughter to have these crazy expensive gifts."
"WIBTA if I argue with the owner of the board game store about their no outside food policy? | Hi all. My friends and I play D&D every week at a local board/RPG game store. We pay a $20/month membership for access to their space, and have reserved the private room every week for almost two years (which should have a cost but they’ve never asked us to pay). 

Recently they got their food service running, and with it, they’ve instituted a no outside food or drink policy. One of my players brought in dinner with him and asked for a fork, and he was politely informed that they wouldn’t provide one because outside food competed with their business. 

Here’s the catch: they serve unhealthy crap (giant pretzels, mini-pizzas, Jamaican beef patties, the standard bar quasi-junk food), and soda. I’m on a diet and can eat none of those things. Two other players are in the same diet boat and another one is a vegetarian that brings his own veggie smoothies. I also – to be frank – don’t trust their food sanitation considering the state of the rest of the store. I at least also can’t eat in advance because I go straight from work to the store (it takes around 90 minutes to get there – I live a county away from the other players.)

WIBTA if I told the owner of the store that the outside food and drink policy wasn’t going to work for us because they didn’t sell anything that we’d eat, *and see if they'd make an exception? ~~and that if it kept up, we’d need to find a different place to play (and thus would cancel our memberships, worth $120 a month total)?~~*

Edit: Some people were fine with the ask but not the delivery, so I've struck the second part. Changes in italics."
"AITA for ringing the school even though my son begged me not to and lying about it when he figured it out. | A week ago my sons school rang me and told me one of his friends had gone to a teacher because my son hadnt bought anything at school or broughtq in a packed lunch.

I give me son £4 everyday for food so I was shocked. When he got home I asked him what he ate. He said pizza. I checked the school menu and they were not serving pizza that day. I knew he was lying. I told him to be honest about what he was eating at school recently. He admitted he hadnt been eating but begged me not to ring the school. 

He was never overweight or anything so I couldnt fathom why he wasnt eating and when I asked him he said it was a diet. I also schedueled therapy.

The school can check what students were buying so I rang up and asked if they could tell me for the next few weeks what he was buying. I also asked if they could have someone make sure he didnt throw it away. They said they would keep an eye on him. For a few days it seemed like my son was eating but then he heard me on the phone and realised who i was talking to and what about. He had a meltdown and screamed at me and said I dont trust him and I am an awful parent and he said he will tell the school I abuse him (i dont) if I kept ringing up. 

I promised him I wont but still rang up. I had to be sure he was eating. I feel like I am deceiving him but is it for the best. I am afraid he will do it again and I only want to check for the next few weeks.

AITA for lying? If he finds out I cant imagine how angry he would be.

Btw hes 15."
"AITA for jumping a fence to leave an apartment complex with locked exits? I broke the fence. | I was at a party, at a friend of a friend's apartment. It was in this new constructed building, a really expensive upscale secured building. Every door in the place had a key card swipe; the host had to come downstairs to let people in. It wasn't really my vibe, it was full of tech-bro types lol

Later that night, my friend who I was with had gone home with a guy, I was not feeling the party anymore because I didn't hardly know anyone there and some guy was hitting on me and I really wasn't into it.

So I grabbed my shoes and bag and made an Irish goodbye. Went downstairs and the door we'd came in from was locked from the inside. Tried the next exit door, same thing. Tried another door, it opened into a parking garage. I walked around there for a while and realized there was no exit; the garage doors needed a keycard and didn't have a manual open that I could find. I went back into the hallway and tried one more door to the outside. It opened into a fenced in courtyard. There was no gate or exit. I went back into the hall, and that had been my last option. 

All the doors out wouldn't open, at least not without pulling the fire alarm next to each that said it'd release the doors. I didn't know the party host's number, my friend had left, and I didn't want to go back up and run into the guy who wouldn't stop hitting on me. Plus I was worried about ending up locked in another part of the building if I tried to find the party again.

I just wanted to go home, I had work in the morning and needed some sleep. I was drunk and exhausted. So I went back out to the courtyard and decided to climb the fence. I used to be a rock climber so I thought it'd be easy. It was a big black metal fence with vertical bars and spikes on the top. 

I got up one side just fine, and took a minute to position myself to go over top without hurting myself on the spikes. Then I swung myself over and grabbed a hold on the other side. And the whole section of fence broke free and fell down with me. I got out from under it just fine and went home.

I told my friends the next day thinking it was ridiculous that there's an rich ass apartment that locks all it's exits, how creepy is that! And they were like ""you could of just called someone instead of breaking that fence"" and ""girl that was dumb of you""

AITA for jumping that fence and breaking it?"
"AITA for not wanting my husband to go back to school. | Throwaway, husband uses reddit.  
  
Backstory first. I (27f) work full time as does my husband (26m). I do make more than my husband and the dicotomy is only going to increase as time goes due to my line of work. We have two kids, a 2 and a half year old  and a 10 month old. We both love our kids endlessly and share equally in all parental duties.  
   
All that said, I do work earlier than my husband and pick both of our children up from their respective daycares and am home with them for a couple hours before my husband gets home. When he gets home, he is more often than not in a, for lack of a better word, shitty mood. He does not like his job, and that stress follows him home.  
   
We are not financially well off at the moment but in the future due to my job, we have spoken of the possibility of him being a stay at home dad. This is the future that I thought we were working towards.  
  
About a month ago, my husband informed me that he was in the process of applying for college. I was a little taken aback due to us both talking about our future with him at home. I am trying to be supportive of the idea, but, did mention that i had thought that he was looking forward to being a stay at home dad.  
  
That is where I left the conversation. I did not tell him of my other concerns which are more responsible for my disagreement with him going back to school. I mentioned that he is in a shitty mood sometimes when he gets back home, and that attitude can sometimes be taken out on our kids.  
   
Now, I do want to stress that he is a great and loving father, but, on some days, seeing the way he interacts with our children can be heartbreaking. He can be short with them and often will shout at our oldest. Every interruption the kids can cause is likely to upset him and cause him to be angry. Most nights I will take over caring for the kids to give him a break as I can see that he is in a bad mood.  
  
The financial aspect of college is also an issue I have. As I mentioned, we are not too financially well off and I do not know how well we could manage the prospect of student loans.   
     
   
**Edit:** Im adding info to maybe help clarify some things.  
   
My husband had decided himself he wanted to be a stay at home dad. He still hasnt said that isnt what he wants to do. If he were to have a change of heart I would not even mind, this is not an issue of me trying to stop hik from achieving his dreams or halt his happiness. This whole school thing was just dumped on me.  
   
About the school. Its a film school in our state that he will be attending through online classes while at home. He will be trying to get a degree in some form of entertainment management (i think). The reason this concerns me is how short he is with the children already. **this is my main concern**. I do not want his behavior at home to get worse due to the added stress of schoolwork and deadlines.  
    
Our financial situation currently demands us both to be working. In maybe 4 years or less it would be feesible for him to no longer work. At that time if he still wanted i would have no issue with him returning to school. Once he no longer has to work at a job he hates.  
  
In the meantime i more than encourage him to find other work that he might enjoy more. But i think adding to his plate while life as it stands seems to be too much for him to bear without snapping out our children at every turn is not wise for the family. 
  


AITA for not wanting him to go back to school? Should I voice my concerns more clearly? Thank you."
"WIBTA for skipping my best friends birthday for a college party | My best friend and I are both currently freshman in college. She goes to community college and I go to college about 3 hours away. 

I made plans weeks ago to go to this huge block party at my college and I am just now realizing it's the same weekend as my best friends birthday. I am really excited as this is my first college party but I feel bad for not going to my best friend for her 18th birthday. She drove all the way here for mine and spent the weekend with me, and we had a lot of fun. I brought it up to her but she assured me that it would be fine if I didn't drive over since she didn't have any plans for her birthday anyway.

This is very unlike her she usually goes all out and I sense that she hasn't been doing well lately but she's not much of a ""talk about my feelings"" type of person. I think it might have something to do with the fact that everyone moved for college this year and she seems to struggle with making new friends. 

She told me multiple times that she wouldn't mind if I didn't come over for her and I've been planning on going to this party with my friends here for weeks. 

So Reddit, would I be the asshole if I skipped her birthday for a college party?"
"AITA? I was called as a reference for a bitchy coworker and I gave her a glowing recommendation so I wouldn’t have to work with her anymore. | Title says most of it.  

This coworker is a totally nightmare. She spreads gossip, is completely rude, talks shit about everyone, and is late constantly. When she is here she tries to avoid answering calls and spends her time doing her makeup and watching YouTube videos. I dread days that we work together because she treats me like garbage (for example I’m training for a new position and she yells at me constantly that I’m too slow answering her questions and that I should just know what she’s talking about automatically even though I’ve only been doing this new job for three weeks).  I was honestly surprised she even listed be as a reference seeing she’s called me an idiot multiple times.   

Last week I got a call that she applied for a job at a local bank and wanted to know about her work ethic and if she worked well as part of a team.

I basically told them she was an excellent worker and an asset to the team and they would be lucky to have her. She makes my life miserable and I just want her gone. I had tried going to my manager before but it went no where and I saw this as my chance to get rid of her. 

Today she came in and gave her two weeks notice so excited she got the job and immediately began insulting us saying she was going to make SO much more money while we were stuck here.

When I told my friend what I did she told me I was an asshole for screwing the other company over. Honestly I don’t regret it at all, but I wanted to know AITA?"
"AITA for asking a friend what was going on at his wedding? It was pretty bad and extremely uncomfortable. | Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

A few days ago my SO and I went to a wedding we were invited to. The groom used to be a pretty good friend of mine but we’ve grown apart as we’ve gotten older but I still got the wedding invite, so I took the days off work and made the appropriate plans. 

Both families are decently well off so I was expecting something pretty nice but it was anything but that, and I’m addition to it not being that nice, everything just felt so *uncomfortable* and *weird* right from the start. 

We arrive at the venue and it doesn’t really seem like a wedding venue. We get ushered into this dimly lit warehouse for the ceremony and no one seems very happy, there’s kids running around the bridesmaids and groomsmen yelling and being crazy and no one stopping them during the whole thing. The brides father was present but didn’t walk her down the aisle. The pastor was reading off his phone for the ceremony in this dimly lit warehouse type area. Then we transition to reception and it’s time to eat and the food was two-day-old leftovers quality served on paper plates. There was no dancing between the bride/her parents or the groom/his parents. The two families were seated as far apart as humanly possible for the reception and the brides mom kept getting impatient and complaining about how long the bridesmaids and grooms men’s speeches were. It was all just so bizarre and no one seemed happy about anything. Me and my SO even watched all the attendants Snapchat’s and instagrams everyone took and everyone just looked *miserable*. 

So, friend thanks me for attending via text two days later and I just couldn’t keep it in anymore. Everyone I talked to and recounted the event to said that it seemed like something was up so I was genuinely concerned and felt kind of bad that this was their wedding, so I told him I appreciated the invite and I was very happy for him, but also that I’m just here for him if he ever needed to chit chat about anything. He responds as if everything is fine and he’s like “why would I need to talk to you about anything? What’s going on?” And my damn curiosity gets the best of me and I can’t keep it in anymore. I’m like “come on man, something was going on at your wedding, everything alright?” And he just hasn’t texted me back since then, and that was yesterday. did I really fuck up by trying to be a good friend?"
"AITA for ignoring my neighbor's request to walk her dog? | I had a friendly relationship with my neighbors over the past couple years, nothing too close but friendly and me and my family walked their huskey Cody a few times just because I felt bad for him and I love dogs and animals in general, we have 4 cats. The owners are big people, joint problems and in their 50s type of thing but nice people. A few months ago when I came back from walking their dog one of them asked me if I wouldn't mind walking their dog here and there, basically on a regular basis is what they wanted. Now keep in mind we aren't that close, I mean they never showed much appreciation even after the 8th time I've walked their dog we never went past small talk.

 I said yeah ok sure but afterwards I started to think you know what? I'm not going to make a commitment to come walk your dog for you, it bothered me that they asked that even though we have done it so many times already. They didn't offer anything I feel like they just assumed because we liked Cody we would do it. I broke my promise, I didn't go back for a while but one time when I was outside Cody was tied up in the yard barking and I was thinking maybe I should go walk him but the wife that asked me before said loudly ""stop barking Cody, he's not coming to walk you"" loud enough so I can hear.

At that point I was thinking ok fuck you. I like Cody but I'm not going to let you make me feel guilty for not walking your dog. I still see them outside sometimes and I look over but they don't wave anymore, now that makes me want to double down on not going over there, although I still feel bad for Cody because they dont seem to walk him as much as they should, AITA?"
"AITA for asking my mates girlfriend why she even bothered coming to the beach with us? | I’ll call my mate (M) John and his girlfriend Sarah and another mate (M) Luke. It was recently John’s birthday (23). We asked him how he wanted to celebrate. He said he wanted to spend the day at the beach. We all through that was cool except Sarah, who doesn’t like the beach but she still wanted to come. We got there, had some food and rented some surfboards. This is where it sort of began. Sarah didn’t want to surf. We told her we’ll be out fairly deep waiting for some big waves. She said that’s fine. We all jumped in the water and out we paddled. Sarah stayed behind with water only up to her ankles. We’re having a blast, catching a few waves and getting wiped out every now and then. The 2 hours was up on the rental so we went back to drop the boards off. Sarah was pretty upset. She kept asking why we were out for so long and that she was bored by herself. We told her we rented them for 2 hours, we’re going to use them for 2 hours. We dropped off the boards, grab another bite to eat and went back into the water. We start pushing each other into oncoming waves, wrestling and talking crap for another hour or two. Every 15 minutes or so, Sarah would ask to get out for a bit to sit on the sand but we all kept saying no. Later, Sarah says she’s had enough and goes back to the shore by herself.  Luke, John and I said we want to keep swimming. Eventually we get tired, head back to the shore, pack up and jump in the car. About half way home, Sarah, after not saying a single word the whole trip says she’s really angry at us for not including her during the day. We told her we had plans to surf and swim all day, that’s what John wanted for his birthday. Furthermore, we live an hour away from the beach, we wanted to make use of the waves, not sit around on sand. She kept saying we left her out and so on. That’s when I asked her in a genuine way, why she even wanted to come if she knew what we were going to do all day. At least bring a book or watch some YouTube or something to keep occupied while we surf. She didn’t respond and just ignored me for the rest of the drive. The next 30 minutes we’re dead silent. I dropped everyone off and went home myself. Luke called me saying I should apologise. I called Sarah but she didn’t pick up. John also said Sarah isn’t responding to him. AITA?

TL DR: My mates girlfriend who doesn’t enjoy the beach came to the beach for my mates birthday and I asked her why she wanted to come, knowing she doesn’t like swimming or surfing. After asking the question, she gets really angry at me. AITA?"
"AITA for stealing money from my parents? | I (28m) was asked by my parents to watch over their house and drive them to the airport before they went on a 12 day cruise. It wasn't an issue because I had the day off and we live close by. They weren't going to pay for anything. I live alone, but we live in the same town which is 2 hours away from the nearest airport. We took my dad's SUV because my car couldn't accommodate their luggage, he's driving there and I would take their car home. We're about 25 minutes away from the airport and the gas light comes on. I tell him there's a gas station along the way to fill up and he mumbles something and continues on. We're now a few blocks from the gas station and tell him again and he passes it, laughs, and says ""I guess you'll need to fill up on the way back, eh?"" I don't like confrontation, but I was steaming inside because it cost me over $100 to fill the tank because I needed gas for at least 4 hours of travel time. The next day when I went over to water their plants I remembered that my parents have a cash stash in their house and I grabbed $100 to cover the gas they made me pay for. It's been a few days but i'm feeling like an asshole for taking cash without telling them. AITA? Should I put the cash back?"
"AITA for unintentionally getting a co-worker fired and blacklisted? | TLDR: Did a performance assessment with a new hire.  She is a single mom and left her 9 y/o son in her hotel room while we were working. I reported this to our manager due to liability and after returning to the home office this afternoon, was informed her contract had been terminated and she would no longer be employed at our affiliate partners. 

This Monday l was in the Midwest evaluating a remote new hire still in her probationary period in my department. While working, we shared small details of our lives that you normally do with new co-workers. She mentioned she was a single mom to a 9 y/o boy and since it was still summer break, she had a hard time finding childcare while she worked. I nodded in sympathy and then she told me she brought him along with her on this business trip to enjoy the hotel amenities and get out of the house. 

I paused what I was doing and looked at her in surprise. I asked if she had gotten approval for family travel as it’s allowed, as long as it’s requested in advance and approved by our manager. She told me that she didn’t think it was a big deal and she’s done it before in other companies. I didn’t say anything else and we finished our day at the site. 

While at the airport, my manager called asking how the review had gone. I gave him my assessment but told him my biggest concern was outside of the site work and mentioned what she had told me. I also expressed my concern over leaving a young child alone for so long. My manager agreed and told me this was a possible liability issue for the company. He said he needed to speak with HR department after our call. I gave him the rest of my assessment and then boarded my flight when it was called. 

Today, I arrived at our office for a weekly in-person team meeting. My manager informed us that the new Midwest hire’s contract had been terminated. He added that she would not be receiving a referral and that she was now blacklisted from working on partner company projects. 

After the meeting, a few colleagues asked me what happened. I summarized the trip and a couple of colleagues, also single mothers, said I shouldn’t have ratted her out because she most likely didn’t have any other option, and now she was no longer employable in our field. I told them I didn’t expect the consequences to be so severe, but I still had to report what she did because of liability. They disagreed and said I should’ve been more sympathetic to her situation. 

Am I the asshole for reporting her transgression?

ADDITIONAL EDIT to answer repeat questions. 

Thank you to everyone who’s given judgement and for all the constructive comments. To those who have attacked me personally based on my post, fair enough. 

6. A lot of people are assuming that the new hire was poor or at least too poor to hire childcare. I never wrote that she was poor, only that she had a hard time finding childcare because of summer break. I’m not trying to be elitist, but to qualify for our job, you need a graduate degree or a BSN with at least a couple of years of experience. The new hire certainly has options with other companies not affiliated with our current one or its partners. Any major health network or any large private clinic certainly has openings for what we do with or without a referral. 

7. In regards to corporate loyalty, me, my coworkers, and her are all contractors. We work for ourselves and we pick and choose contracts that we want to take. Once your contract is up, you move on. I could care less who the higher ups are as long as I get a fair evaluation at the end of my contract. 

8. As for HR policy regarding employee information. My field review summary is not privileged information among departmental co-workers who are also field reviewers. This wasn’t water cooler gossip. This was me giving a factual account of what occurred to people who perform the same function that I do. The fact that 2 co-workers thought I was an asshole is a result of this discussion. 

9. Some have asked what I do for a living. In broad terms, my co-workers and I audit clinics, hospitals, and insurance companies to be sure no fraud is happening on either end, and that government laws are followed in regards to procedures and practices. It’s literally our job to be meticulous in following and enforcing established policies. 

EDIT for Clarifications

1. She knew about the travel policies and needing approval.  We are all trained on company SOPs as contractors for several weeks before being certified. Once certified, we’re field reviewed and if approved are assigned work projects as remote workers. 

2. My role as a field reviewer was to assess her on her work ethic, site task abilities, and adherence to our SOPs including travel guidelines. I’m not allowed to give feedback to her as it’s her assigned mentor’s job to discuss strengths, weaknesses, and how to improve because they work one on one with new hires closely. I’m a essentially a proctor overseeing a field test. 

3. I’ve never met her or spoken with her or her son  before this past Monday and only know what she mentioned in passing. 

4. Her mentor and my manager would have learned she was traveling with someone eventually because the hotel receipt lists the room service menu items purchased. There no possible way food could have been delivered to her room while she was at work with me without someone else ordering it. 

5. “Outside of site work” refers specifically to the tasks we do while at the clinic but doesn’t mean she isn’t evaluated for following guidelines while offsite during travel."
"AITA for making my 14 year old brother stay up until 5AM (on a Sunday morning) to complete homework? | Since I got home from my sophomore year of college last week, I have been watching my kid brother (14, freshman in high school) spiral into bad grades, and I knew my mom would never be tough enough on him to really make an impact.

I fed him at 7:00PM and then I interrupted him playing video games to complete his homework. He had weeks’ worth of grade recovery packets for math, English and history that weren’t done and he only had until Monday at 3:00 to finish.

He cried several times. Every time he told me he wanted to go to bed or stop, I told him it was this, or commit to being a D-student for the rest of his life.

I never helped him, but I checked his work to make sure it was correct. If it wasn’t, I’d mark where it was wrong and hand it back.

I did it out of love for the kid, but I’m pretty sure he won’t talk to me for the rest of the summer. My mom is pissed too, but I didn’t see another way to keep him from getting D’s or worse in practically every class.

Am I an asshole older brother?

Edit: not making excuses, I was told this would provide better context. Part of the reason we went from 7:00PM to 5:00AM was A.) He didn’t tell me he could earn back the credit until about 5 Saturday night, and B.) I had to head back to college Sunday afternoon."
"AITA for pulling the disability card? | I’m a wheelchair user, I work in a 20 story office building. We have maybe 15-20 lifts around the building, the small lift lobbies have 2 steps up to the office area, they aren’t busy as they are out of the way. I work on the 12th floor and our canteen is on the 8th floor. I use the main lift lobby which have 8 lifts. So I recently went for lunch on the 8th floor but sometime during that the 6 newer lifts malfunctioned meaning there’s only  2 in the main lobby working. I expected to wait a bit longer , but full lifts kept stopping completely full for 10 minutes, I then tried to pretend to squeeze in the packed lifts. 15 minutes go by I’m getting a bit pissed, the next list stops, people look at there feet avoiding me,  I asked if anybody could get out because I’ve been waiting a long time and there’s lots of stairwells and the outer lift lobbies are probably less busy, nobody does anything. I move forward stopping the door from closing and tell everyone the lift is not going anywhere and they are horrible people for being lucky enough to walk and ignoring me. The lift empties out and I get to my floor.

AITA , maybe people in the lift had non visible disabilities and I was a bitch 


Edit: I’ve concluded I am a sort of arsehole, it would have been nice if people had offered to get out and make room but I think telling them they were horrible human beings was out of line.  People always seem to be worried about not helping me and also patronising me, I think a lot of people in the lifts probably were just not sure what to do. Sometimes I don’t think to give up my space in the priority area ( they usually have fold down seats and offer more leg room and a space for crutches/ walking sticks and working dogs etc) on public transport to people on crutches or the elderly sometimes even though standing probably causing them pain and me just  grabbing the train or bus behind is inconvenient but not causing discomfort.

"AITA: My Sister is A Newly Minted Bridezilla | EDIT: I am still her Maid of Honor and expected to plan the bridal shower and bachelorette party for her. Bridezilla might not be the best word, but I don't know how else to describe it.

EDIT v2: She's not planning on telling people they aren't invited to the wedding unless they ask her directly.

My sister got engaged a few weeks ago to a really immature ""frat"" manchild. Now that they are planning their wedding, he has decided that he wants a very small (i.e. immediate families only plus whichever friends decided to shell out the money) wedding in Greece or Portugal, which is fine for me and no reception stateside for everyone who can't attend.

My sister; however, has expectations of a large bridal shower and bachelorette party because she has ""so many friends she can't exclude."" Mind you, she's been in quite a few weddings as is so I understand that many friends will want to come to those events, plus a huge part of my professional job is event planning so I know how to throw amazing events.

My problem is that I feel that if she has no intention of inviting them to the wedding nor doing a reception in the US for them, is it selfish of her to want to have these massive events so she can get more gifts or am I being a bitch about her wedding choices?"

"AITA for bringing my active dog to the ""less active"" side of the dog park? | I just got back from the most disappointing experience I've had at the dog park so far.

I have a dog that just turned one last month. She is a chihuahua/rat terrier mix, about 14lbs. Smol pupper. She is very social and playful and loves going to the dog park to play with other dogs.

I just moved to a new city last month, where thankfully there is a dog park super close to my house. Both parks - my old one and new one - are separated into two sides. The old park was separated by dog size, while the new one is separated into ""active"" and ""less active"".

I have been taking her onto the active side for the last month and haven't had any issues. Most of the dogs there are pretty big, but she plays well and gets along with pretty much any kind of dog. She absolutely loves to play and be chased by the bigger dogs (she think she is big dog). A few people at the park have told me how they love how well my smol dog is able to keep up with and play with the big bois and girls. 

I brought her today and there were about maybe about 8 other dogs there, all pretty big (50+lbs). Normally this doesn't really matter (she wrestles with my friend's 120lb dog sometimes), but there were two dogs that were interested in playing with her that were playing too rough. They both kept growling while playing (I know this is normal, but it makes my dog nervous) and were being too rough when wrestling, causing her to roll all over the ground and get stepped on. I picked her up and moved her to the other side of the dog park, but they found each other again. My dog actually liked playing with them (she kept going back for more...) but these dogs were playing like she was a big dog and I got nervous. They are both wrestling her, nudging her with their snouts and shes getting tossed up in the air and doing double barrel rolls all over the place. Basically a ragdoll. I had to stop it again (with the help of the other dog owners) and since I just got there like 5 minutes ago, I took her to the ""less active"" side.

On that side, there was an older woman there with two small dogs, my dog's size. My dog just followed one of them around for a while and then wanted to play, so she started doing the play bow and barking. One of the dogs got very defensive and the other was like wtf is going on. They just didn't seem to be very social dogs and weren't interested in playing, but my dog is very persistent. They just kept barking and growling at her. The owner comes over and says that my dog ""seems pretty active"" in a snarky tone. I didn't know what to say to that. I just went home a short while late.

I felt bad, but at the same time, I didn't know what to do. My dog was going to get hurt at the active side, but was too active for the less active side, apparently. At the same time, I want to respect the rules of the park. I feel like those who have small, very active dogs, can't win. So what do I do? AITA?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the responses. I read them all. I feel like the best course of action would be that if something like this happens again, I will just leave.  It sucks, but I understand that I shouldn’t ruin other people’s outings. It wasn’t my intention to do so, nor am I trying to be entitled. I feel like the following may explain why I brought her over to the other side:

The rules are followed very loosely at dog parks...not that it’s ok, but for real. Kids under 8 are not supposed to be there and I’ve seen toddlers walking around, getting jumped on by dogs, and the parents getting upset when someone asks them to leave. At my old dog park, the big dog side was known to be full of rough players....MANY big dogs would come over to the small side because they were getting “beat up”. And these dogs were able to play fine with the small dogs. Many people visit both sides, at both parks I have went to. No firearms allowed, and some guy comes in waving his gun around, threatening to shoot someone...with no one there to enforce them, the rules aren’t always going to be followed. Not that it’s ok...my point is is that switching sides is very common. The less active side is often empty or has a couple of active, small dogs. I brought her over to the less active side before, and she and like 5 other small dogs were running around and all the owners were talking and happy...it’s such an arbitrary rule that I’m not sure it can really be enforced. When I took her over there today, I didn’t really think anything of it because it’s so common. That’s why I was a little shocked to read all of these YTA. I thought that maybe the other persons dogs might be playful, but the owner didn’t want them with the big dogs (other owners I’ve spoken to on the less active side have said that’s why they have their dog on that side).

Also, I feel like some people think I just let my dog harass the other dogs for like an hour. We were there for like 10 minutes. She spent the first five minutes following a dog around, peeing with him, which he was ok with. They were just walking around and peeing. They didn’t start getting pissed until she initiated play. I saw that they were not interested so I redirected her. She did it again, so I redirected her and moved her away from them. She tried a few minutes again, and that’s when I took her home. My dog was not a physical threat to them, just barking and doing the play bow, and I did not just stand there and watch. A lot of assumptions here."
"AITA for sending a message after a first date saying I don't want to meet again because they looked very different (worse) than their photos? | (Gender neutral language used on purpose)

I have been jumping feet first into the dating pool recently (mainly app based) and have come to the conclusion that I have to arrange dates as soon as possible because a lot of people use old or heavily filtered photos and when we meet up it's different to expectations. To each their own, but I've had really good conversations with people via text, then on meeting I find out that I am not attracted to them and that would have been clear if they'd represented themselves accurately. Obviously everyone wants to put their most flattering photos, but I'm talking about major weight/age/face differences. Not an attack at any type of person, but just being accurate.

I never like to ghost someone and I always send a ""It was nice meeting but I don't think I'm interested in pursuing anything further"" type message. Would I be an asshole to include ""... to be honest, the reason is you look quite different from your photos and when we met I realised you're not my type"".

If someone said that to me I think I would be upset, but then realise that I should look at being more accurate. Perhaps the person doesn't currently realise the reason dates don't work out is because the other person is disappointed on arrival."
"AITA A burger with no fries??? | AITA? Two points of view (POV). 

My Roommates POV:
I was sick at home all day feeling weak. My roommate comes home and decides to go to MCDonalds. My roommate asks what I want, to which I weakly reply “get me a Big Mac” . Later he returns with a full meal for himself and only a  burger for myself. Upon seeing his full meal and the lack of fries with my burger I was mad that I didn’t get fries. AITA?

My POV:
My roommate is sick. I’m hungry so I decide to head out to get a burger. On my way out I ask “do you want anything from McDonald’s?” To which he unenthusiastically replies “get me a Big Mac”. I return a bit later with a meal for myself and a only Big Mac for my roommate. My flatmate is upset because there were no fries with his meals and he felt there was an implicit ask. I brought him exactly what he asked for so I feel guilt free. AITA?"
"AITA for calling out a lady for accusing me of ogling someone? | I was on one of those airport rail links they have to get you to different sections of large airports. I was just staring outside the window enjoying the scenery in a moderately crowded train (people were standing, but you could still move around freely)

This attractive woman got on and I did glance at her for a couple seconds but as I had a girlfriend back home and it’s rude to stare at anyone I went back to appreciating scenery quickly. However since my right eye is blind, it seems to onlookers that I’m staring at something on the right side of my periphery. Hence I was staring outside, but the woman was standing to the right so it kinda looked like I was staring at her.

So this other woman walks up to me, blue pixie cut and catty voice and just starts to go off on me for staring. I admit I was riled up pretty much immediately and asked her if she was in the business of making fun of disabled people instead of diffusing the situation. When she asked what the fuck I was talking about I pointed to my eye and said “I can only see out of my left, which was clearly appreciating the scenery outside”. She responded but honestly I wasn’t listening and just told her to fuck off with her assumptions. The rest of the passengers started kind of looking at us, mostly her.

When I got off the train and told my girlfriend about it on the phone in the waiting area she agreed with me, but her friend who shared the story with was mad at me for not understanding what women go through or something. IMO being half blind man is worse than being a non half blind woman, all other things equal, so I didn’t really see her pov."
"AITA For walking right in to a family causing the mom and her husband to fall over. | So, this is a throwaway account and in case there are grammar mistakes, I am from Europe so be forgiving!

Now, today I was visiting a city in my country together with my girlfriend and a couple we are friends with, after a fun day of me and the other guy being treated like packing mules we decided to head to a nice restaurant we saw while exploring the city before going back home.

Now this is where my AITA question begins, as we were making our way to the restaurant we were walking on a sidewalk next to an extremely busy road, now this was not a small sidewalk we are talking a good 5 meters wide at least so plenty of room for everyone.

Well after a while we spotted a family coming from the opposite direction and as we got closer they were not getting out of the way, where as my girlfriend moved behind me and the couple behind her. Now this family was 6 people A mother and a father on our side, holding hands, in the middle 2 kids and on the far side 2 elderly people who I assume were grandparents.

Now they were not getting out of the way, all holding hands, taking up the full sidewalk despite clearly seeing us coming and we were clearly getting out of the way, regardless I kept walking because we were out of the way as far as possible.

Good moment to mention that I am a 2.05 meter tall Gym bro looking dude, as a result as we met them I bumped straight in to the husband, I was already out of the way as far as I could and this dude seemed to expect I jumped on to the busy road or something. Now this resulted in him falling in to his wife and they both stumbled right on the ground rather harshly, now I said ""That's what you get you rude douche."" He didn't say anything and his wife was cursing but we went on our merry way.

Later in the evening when we got home, my girlfriend told me that was extremely rude of me, where as I am of the opinion the dude owed it all to himself, so now here we are for your judgement."
"AITA for shaving my daughter's head bald when she wanted to? | Last year, my daughter (13F at the time) asked me if she could get her head shaved. She was going to go to the local salon and have them do it. 

This was a surprise to me, she is otherwise very girly and even when she was younger she was very invested in how she looks. I asked why she suddenly wanted to shave her head and she said that a girl she follows on Instagram did it for charity and she thought she looked good and wanted to try it. I tried to explain to her that the other kids might make fun of her and that at her age even a boy would have a rough time being bald at school. She wasn't phased and still wanted it done.

At that point I thought that at least it would grow back if she ended up not liking it. It's not as if she's doing something permanent like a tattoo, it might take a few months but it won't matter in a few years. I told her that it's not worth paying for at the salon and agreed to shave it myself in the bathroom. I used my beard trimmer to get her down to the stubble, and then, at her request, used one of those disposable BIC razors to shave her completely smooth.

At first, she seemed happy with it. But just a few hours later I overhear her in her room FaceTiming one of her friends, she was clearly upset. After I hear her hang-up I went into her room to ask her what was wrong. She said that she regretted what she had just done. She said that she felt ugly and that she felt like it would take forever to grow back. I told her that I did warn her against it, and she agreed it was her fault. I still did feel sorry for her, so I offered to buy her a wig, she found one on Amazon and I ordered it for her. Problem was, this was a Saturday and it wasn't going to arrive until Tuesday, meaning she would have to go to school for two days unable to hide that she was bald. I reassured her that she still looked beautiful and that in a few weeks nobody would care anymore. She was still nervous and upset, like any woman or girl would be in that situation, but the next morning she was feeling a lot better than I expected her to be.

That evening, my ex-wife, who has custody of her and my son (9M) mon-fri came was coming to pick them up. I called her in advance to explain the situation to her and she was furious. She called me a moron and said I shouldn't have let a 13 year old girl make a drastic decision she could so easily regret. I maintained that at 13 kids should start to have a bit more freedom when it comes to their appearance and that it would be a good lesson about how she should think harder about decisions that cannot be immediately reversed.

This was almost a year ago, my daughter's hair is now at a normal length, her friends were supportive of her throughout the whole thing and the situation never led to any major conflict beyond my ex being pissed off at me for a few weeks. Looking back on it, I'm not sure what I should have done. Thoughts?"
"AITA for not helping my sister? | Throwaway because I really suspect IATA here. Standard apologies for mobile formatting.


Six years ago I had my daughter. There were unexpected complications after the delivery. I needed a longer hospital stay and recovery was difficult. It was also incredibly expensive. I was on unpaid leave so only my husband was working so money was suddenly very tight. I had arranged for some help after the delivery but because of the unexpected complications it wasn't enough. We couldn't afford to pay for longer either. 


My sister lives in a nearby city so I called her and told her the situation. I asked her if she could come over for the weekends for two months just so I had some help. I told her that in that time my husband and I would save up money and again get some help. She refused. She said, "" You know I'm not good with kids, and a newborn will be really difficult. "" I told her I understood and it was only out of desperation that I was calling her. She still said no, that it was too much for her.


I somehow made it through. To this day I resent my sister. While I understand that it was not her responsibility to do anything about my issues, was it so unreasonable to expect my own sister to help me when shit unexpectedly hit the fan? 


A month ago I found out from our mother that my sister's husband has been diagnosed with lymphoma. Then my sister called me yesterday. She was sobbing. Chemotherapy has drained them both physically and financially. Her husband is not working. She has to both work and take care of her sick husband. She asked if I could help her take care of her husband because she's not able to manage on her own. I was so angry that she would even dare to ask me for help. I just hung up on her. 

However after sleeping on it, there is this persistent thought in the back of my head that IATA."
"AITA for snapping at a child in a veterinary waiting room? | Background: My cat has a problem with his tail resulting in it being very limp, issues walking and generally crying out in pain when he moves.

   A few days ago I was sat in a vet’s waiting room with my sick cat on my lap in his carrier, waiting for him to be admitted for his x-ray.  While we were waiting, a mother and her child (about 6 or 7) entered the room with their dog and approached the receptionist to pay for something. The child noticed my cat and walked over to the carrier to look at him. 
   It started off innocently enough with him saying hello to him and saying he was beautiful but then he wouldn’t leave. He put his face right up to the carrier and started talking louder. My cat was quite agitated at this point and the child had obviously mistaken his meows as a sign of affection. He started jumping on the floor to try to get his attention and then started clapping his hands. I repeatedly hinted that my cat was sick and needed some peace and quiet but he didn’t listen. At one point I thought he was leaving but was actually attempting to get his dog from his mother to bring him over ‘to say hello to my cat’. 
 I finally snapped and told him, “Will you go away, my cat isn’t well!” He looked horrified and quickly retreated to his mother who gave me a death stare but said nothing. They eventually left.

*Edit for clarification*

This took place in an empty waiting room bar the people mentioned.
The waiting room was small and the mother was able to both hear and see the conversation.
I told the child my cat was sick and needed peace and quiet but never directly told him to stop.
The volume of my voice remained the same throughout the conversation."
"AITA for smoking a joint while going for a walk? | Sometimes I like to get high then go for a long walk with headphones in and just get lost in the music I'm listening to. It gets me outside, get me moving, and I feel super happy and relaxed when I get back inside. 

Yesterday I decided to roll a joint and smoke it as I walk. Usually I do this at night, or smoke before leaving the house if its day time. Yesterday I did not (it was about 3-4pm). I smoked half, walked for about an hour, then decided to smoke the other half. As I'm lighting up and taking a couple puffs, a lady sitting in her yard with a kid (preteen I guess? 12-14 ish) put her hands up with a wtf look on her face and yells to me that I can't be smoking weed out on the streets like that. Now I know she didnt mean legally, as I live in Canada and it's been legal for over a year by now. She obviously meant morally, I assume because her kid was outside seeing this too.

I didnt think it was a big deal, but it immediately ruined my buzz and I spent the rest of the walk worrying that I'm being disrespectful or maybe just unintentionally promoting something negative?  I dont know.. should I just make a point of smoking beforehand or is it okay to smoke outside on a walk the same way one would smoke a cigarette?"
"WIBTA if I didn't tell Amazon I found the package? | During Thanksgiving break, I ordered a quite expensive thing (>$200). I had been waiting for a while for it and the app said it would be delivered on Friday. Friday, the app showed it was delivered but I didn't receive it. I checked my mailbox and nothing there too. Then, I asked Amazon and they told me to wait another day in case the driver marked it incorrectly. After a day, I contacted them again and they refunded my money.

Sunday morning (I hadn't left my home until then except to check my mailbox), I was walking to my car and I saw at a different apartment (2 floors down). I knew those people had left for Thanksgiving (college students like me) and so I checked what the name was on the box - it was my name and address. The person delivered it to the wrong apartment.

For all intents and purposes, I wouldn't have found the item if it wasn't for sheer luck. However, I don't know if it is ethical to keep the money and the item. Instead, I wouldn't mind just donating the amount to a charity and keeping the item. WIBTA if I didn't tell amazon about this?  


Update: I have decided to go ahead and let them know anyway. 

In all honesty, this post only made me more confused because the YTA/NTA split was fairly even with good points on both sides. On one end, it's kind of like I found something on the ground (If I found a $100 bill on the ground I wouldn't go return it) but on the other hand, I did get what I ordered (even if I had to look for it).  I'm also actively reducing my Amazon footprint because I don't agree with their business practices but as someone said it doesn't give me the right to be unethical.

I still believe amazon is at fault for not holding up their end of the deal and I hope they at least give me a discount or something but the main reason for this decision was that I don't want the driver to get fired over such a small thing so I will lie and tell them my neighbors picked it up. Thank you for everyone who participated!   


I will do another update to let y'all know what amazon says"
"AITA for uninviting my friend to a party after she did the same. | My friend invited me to a party with some of her random friends. I was looking forward to going to this party. So I obviously made plans around that day, however she then texts me the day before saying,”Sowwy u wanted me to be straight up with u so I don’t want to bring u to that thing on Saturday.” Initially I was cool with it, but then i was a little offended because I already thought I was going. When I asked for a reason y (and I wasn’t rude about it) she said “no” followed by “sorry lol.” Well, I talked to her the day after the party and told her how I felt about it. She never acted like this before so you could understand my surprise. Well I decided to get back at her so she could understand how I felt.
I had my birthday coming up and I wanted to celebrate by inviting some friends. I told her a week in advance, however the day before I told her I didn’t want her to go. 
Now she’s calling me an asshole. My other friends say otherwise. AITA"
"AITA if I don't accompany my husband to his second tattoo session because of my own jealousy? | I am awake in the middle of the night wrestling with a lot of feelings and feel like shit, so if my suspicions are true and I'm an asshole please tell me. 

My husband and I drove 4 hours away to a very talented tattoo artist, are paying a shit ton of money for him to be tattooed here and it is his first tattoo. It will be a sleeve, this trip is two days worth and only the first of several similar sessions.

I don't really want to go with him to sit in the shop for 9 hours (again) watching him get ink on a level I would love to have but can't because we wouldn't be able to afford it. I feel like never showing my own tattoos ever again because by comparison mine look like shit. I used to adore my tattoos and thought they were awesome but they're boring plain cartoon characters done in a more american traditional style with bold color and defined outlines. This artist is a cartoon realism style and looks fucking amazing. I have had mine for years and was proud, now I'm ashamed to show them. 

I feel jealous and regretful and feel shitty for feeling that way. He sat for 9 hours without any issue and he said it didn't even hurt much. To be fair this artist does not do lines in his work which I found color/shading way more tolerable but I feel kind of irritated he had such little pain and I was internally screaming having some of mine done. Like not only does he have amazing art but it didn't even hurt. 

I haven't said anything at all about how I feel because I want him to enjoy it and have fun and love his new ink. I don't want to ruin his whole experience over my emotional ineptitude. I know I will process the emotion and get over it... Yet I kind of just want to stay at the hotel or go do my own thing for the next day to lessen the amount of resentment I'm feeling right now. Would that be an asshole move? Or should I stfu and just stew in my emotions at the appointment.

EDIT: I realized I said I didn't talk to him at all, which isn't entirely accurate. I did tell him I felt jealous and how I felt my own art looks shitty compared to his. He just said my tattoos weren't bad. This was on the ride back to the hotel. He fell asleep pretty much immediately after we got to our hotel room and has been out since. That was the extent of it. I haven't discussed it further.


Edit to update: I did speak with him this AM and feel better after but ink envy is still there. Working on being patient until we can afford to have my own piece done."
"AITA for telling my female friend not to come to the bar I was at? | I’m a 25 y/o Male. A few days ago I went to a bar with a tinder date. 

I texted a friend of mine what she was doing that night and she said she was going clubbing with our group of friends. About an hour later she texts me asking me if I was still going to the bar and what time I’d be there. She made it seem as if she wanted to come.

The convo went like this:

Her: Are you there yet? 

Me: Yeah

Her: Do you have to pay to get in?

Me: Yeah but don’t come if it’s just you though.

(She replied before I could explain)

Her: Wow 

Me: I’m on a date and that might make it awkward lol 

Me: It’s not personal it would just be weird if I went on a date with her and brought a female coworker you know. A group would be fine but just us three would be weird.


She didn’t reply.

Was I an asshole?"
"AITA for exposing a student in one of my classes? | So I am a junior in high school and the course that I am attending is quite a challenging one. Due to this reason, a couple of my friends and I created a facebook group where we can ask questions to each other and such. The group expanded with the majority of the students taking the course being in the group. Now the problem is this: A sophomore student joined the group. Keep in mind it was a group for just some questions and general help. This student, for some reason, thought it was a tutor group or some shit. An average member in the group would ask a question or two per month or none at all. This student legit spammed the shit of our group with personal basic questions that were quite stupid and useless. They were questions about basic concepts that teachers went over in class and it was absurd. And it got annoying. The student would post around 10-12 questions per day and the majority of the members started to stop answering her questions. Now this would be a hint, right? Nope. She reported this to the teacher and the teacher gave us a talk about including everyone and not excluding people. So most of us in the group are pretty fucking annoyed with multiple people just leaving the group. Out of frustration, on one of her posts, I sent a clear message. ""\[Student's name\], please try to avoid asking multiple questions that could be answered by a simple google search. This is not a replacement for a tutor, but merely a small community for us to help EACH OTHER. Thanks"". All hail went loose. I got reported to the office, got a talk about verbal abuse and yada yada yada. Some people thanked me. Some people glared at me. Now, I personally thought it was one of those cases where ""someone had to do it"". Am I the asshole here?"
"AITA for not wanting a baby at my wedding? | Under normal circumstances, I think wanting a child-free wedding is fair. They are noisy and in the way and if we go for a sit-down meal, they need catering for differently. The youngest family member I'm inviting is 13, the rest of my guests are adults.

But here's the snag. We want to have our reception at the Cricket club, because my husband-to-be's cousin organizes the events, so we should be able to get a good deal on the venue hire.

But his Cousin has a 2-3 year old daughter. I've only met her once, so I can't say if she's well behaved or not, but I feel like this age is young enough to be a nuisance.

My partner doesn't want the baby at the wedding either, but he thinks that his Cousin is likely to be offended if her daughter isn't invited. 

AITA for wanting ""mates rates"" on a wedding venue from my partner's cousin, but also saying she can't bring her baby?"
"AITA for leaving 14y.o alone at home for a night | I meant to write hotel in title. 

It’s more like are we the assholes?

Me(17M) and my friends are on vacation rn, one of my friends had to bring his 14 year old brother. It’s been fine so far. 

Yesterday we wanted to go out, we told his brother and he said he’s be fine alone. We left at 12 am and got back in hotel at 3 pm.

He told him parents that he was home alone I guess, so before we got home their parents called my friend.  They were mad at all of us for leaving him alone like that and called us irresponsible."
"AITA for wanting inlaws to pay what they said? | My husband and I both have degrees and loans.We are paying them off in our regular budget. When he went to college, his parents told him verbally they would pay for half his loans. They were paying monthly payments on a $40,000 loan and he was paying the other $40,000 loan. So he has 80,000 in debt in his name.

Recently his parents moved to NV from SC, in part to be closer to us. They mentioned to us when they were planning this they may take paycuts to do this and may need help with the loan. We agreed and told them when they had more specifics we could work it out.Then a few weeks before they moved, my FIL called DH and told him the whole loan is his/ours now. No discussion. This month, we took over the other 40,000 doubling what we pay each month.

Short term I have no problem covering this. FIL has no job yet and MIL just started a new job. They bought a townhome and will move in August.We want to bring this up once both of them have jobs and are moved into their townhome. I have no clue how to have a conversation without ruining the relationship. My inlaws are generally good people and I have a decent relationship with them. They are generous but on their own terms. When they sold their home in SC they gave each kid $10,000 of the profits. We used this to get a needed new roof. I feel they will use this gift as well as countless dinners/trips to call us ungrateful which isn't true. 

I grew up with living paycheck to paycheck. I told myself I wouldn’t do that to my kids. We have worked hard to keep debt down while still enjoying life. We budget based on the debt he had NOT including his parents portion. We were going to talk about kids next year, but I don’t think we can afford it now.

I want to bring it to my inlaws using this. Rather than “hold up your end of the deal” but “we want kids and we dont know how to make that happen with this extra debt. Can you help us out?” No matter how we phrase it, its going to be a rough conversation.

Adding things said on FB:

We have looked at refinancing. It doesn't take monthly payments down at all to combine/refinance the loans at this point.

My inlaws can afford to pay some. Maybe not all. But they are talking of getting a vacation home in Mammoth in the next few years. I also know they profited a lot on their home sale. They could have put a down payment of at least $10,000 more on their townhome if they chose.

Yes, I know we will never be ""ready"" for kids financially. But the thing is, we were already struggling to come up with a plan with our jobs long hours for childcare. We were already going to have to make cuts, this just makes it feel impossible.

Loans are in my husband's name. But we have made financial decisions based on the knowledge that his parents were covering half. So now by doubling that, it makes some of our financial choices feel irresponsible, when they weren't in our situation at the time. (New car, house payment, etc)"
"AITA for wanting privacy about the cost of my home? | Background: My parents have a long history of oversharing their kids’ information.  Some were egregious: when my older sister started menstruating, they called a bunch of relatives and told them.  Some were just annoying: I was on a stressful work trip in a city 2 hours from where my mom’s cousin lives and mom made a point of calling to tell her, which meant I had to field calls and texts to explain why it wasn’t possible for me to go meet up with them in person during the 30 hr trip even though it was “so close”.  I still hear about how I came so near where they live but didn’t take time to go see them and it’s been 2 years!  

Currently: I recently bought a condo which is my first non-rental home as an adult.  I covered the down payment myself and have been financially independent since I was 24.  I did rely heavily on my parents during the closing process for advice on the paperwork, going over the inspection, and general knowledge of how things work when you are buying a home. I went for a visit and walked in to hearing my dad talking to his brother and he goes ahead and lays out how much my condo cost, how much of a down payment I made, how much my monthly mortgage will be, and what my condo fees will be.  I got angry and made a wtf? face while he was on the phone and once he had hung up, demanded to know why he was telling people this information.  My dad got really angry too and snapped back that I’m stupid for being upset about him sharing publicly available information with his own brother. Then stormed off muttering about how I have no values or sense of what it means to be family. 

I complained to my sister about it and with no hesitation, she told me I was unreasonable and that I had made a fuss over nothing.  I felt strongly in the moment and even now when I’m calm that my privacy was being infringed on, but it seems I’m the only one in my immediate family who thinks that.  Am I really the asshole here?

Update: Thanks for the feedback.  Many of you said that I shouldn’t have let them get so involved and I totally agree. At the time, I caved because my Parents were already so angry because they found out I was looking for a condo and made an offer without telling them.  There were tears and yelling from them and when dad demanded to see the papers, I wussed out and justified it by telling myself that at least I’d be able to avoid a big mistake if he is looking things over too.  This has been a recurring problem as you’ve pointed out, I should keep quiet if I don’t want people to know certain things."
"AITA I snapped at my husband to stop calling our 4 y/o ‘pretty’ constantly? | First things first, I know I was the asshole for snapping, and I’ve apologized to him for my delivery. HOWEVER I strongly feel like the reason for my question isn’t assholey but he really really thinks it is. 

We were trying for a baby for what felt like way too long. We had our miracle baby Isla 4 years ago and admittedly both of us have fallen head over heels in love with her. We do both dote on her and so do her grandparents. 

My husband is a VERY intelligent man, and has probably one of the most interesting jobs I’ve ever heard of at a large scientific institute in the US. He is an educated man and more than that, he is kind, sensitive, even 20 years ago when attitudes were still backwards he was the same as he is now, which are all qualities that made me fall in love with him. 

He has (as I have) instilled in our daughter a deep love of knowledge and intelligence. However recently for the past six months ish I’ve noticed that ALL he does is talk about about beautiful she is. When he comes home from work, the first thing isn’t ‘what cool fact did you learn today?’ It’s ‘oh my gosh your macaroni necklace looks so beautiful on you!’ Etc. 

I have asked him to concentrate more on her abilities, and her achievements, but he has told me it’s bizarre that I want to stop him from expressing his pride. I just feel that it’s sort of ....letting my daughter down that her daddy praises more her looks than anything else. 

The icing on the cake was when we took her in to work and all of his coworkers were fawning over how cute she is. I would have expected him to praise literally anything else, how she’s taken a mini interest in his line of work, anything, but it never came."
"AITA for giving my son money without my wife's knowledge? | When my son started University it wasn't very far away from our house so me and my wife agreed to let our son to stay at our house while he's still in uni.

Before I start dotting down my story, let me tell you something... money is definitely not an obstacle in our household, we have way more than enough, but the disproportion of each family member's money is huge.

For example: last week my son went to a place to eat, spent roughly $7 and paid via his debit card. When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...

I came back from work and she told me what happened... I said ""I will talk to him about it."" but when I went to his room I just told him ""Don't worry about it.""

When I came back to the kitchen she told me ""Do you like my new perfume?"" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said ""You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?"" she got upset and went to the bathroom.

Two weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then."
"WIBTA If i don’t adopt my sister’s daughter | Sorry if it has a lot of error, English is not my first language.

A little background. I live with my girlfriend in our own house. We have been together for around 6 years so we can say that it’s a very stable relationship. We also have good jobs so we are also stable in that aspect.

My sister has a little daughter ( 5yo ) and we often take care of her when my sister and his husband can’t. Like when they are on a travel or something. Both I and my girlfriend love my niece, we love to be with her and take care of her.

And this past week we had to take care of her because his parents were having a little vacation with their in laws. But before they arrived they suffered an accident and both died. Like you can imagine this was devastating for all of my family. I hasn’t been easy, specially because I had to tell my niece what had happened.

Now, she is staying at my home for now. I thought that this would only be temporal, until we figure out what we are going to do with her. But when I bring up this topic with her grandparents they all thought I was going to adopt her. Because the thing is that the only sibling of my sister is me and his husband didn’t have any siblings, and both my parents and my sisters in-laws are to old to raise a child.

An look, I and my girlfriend both love my niece. But the thing is that we are not sure if we want or can raise a child ( financially we can but we don’t know if we are ready ). We had thought about having kids but not now. And it’s kinda difficult to suddenly have to raise a child like your own. There is a big difference between taking here the weekends and raising her.

I talk to some of my friends and they said that a possible solution was to put her into adoption or foster care. But all of my family is against this, saying that I’m “betraying my sister”. And in a way I feel like I’m being a piece of shit for even thinking this but I also think I’m not ready for this."
"AITA for not wanting to stay with my GF following a serious chronic health diagnosis? | Sorry if I'm not abiding by some rules, this is my first post on Reddit. My understanding of the site and this subreddit's culture is new to me.

&#x200B;

Background: I've previously been in a relationship with someone who had serious chronic medical issues (bipolar, depression, Asperger's, and MS-like degenerative genetic time-bomb) for which she was regularly hospitalized. The relationship deteriorated quickly after I found her cheating on me despite my support in taking her to her appointments and visiting her when she was in the hospital. 

&#x200B;

Now, years later, I'm in a much MUCH better relationship with a great person who has supported me in my efforts to go back to graduate school, and progress professionally. However, certain medical issues are arising that could lead to a significant change in how our futures play out. If her diagnosis is truly the worst-case scenario of MS, I don't know what kind of future to expect. I'm all but guaranteed to be the sole bread-winner, and the possibility of MS means that having a family with her evaporates.

&#x200B;

Reddit, am I the asshole for wanting a life partner that can keep up with me?"
"AITA for shitting myself at my brother’s wedding? | Not a shitpost, a post discussing shit yes, but not a shtpost. God I wish it was.

My brother proposed to his girlfriend of a few years last year, the wedding was 2 weeks ago. Ceremony was held on the beach, we planned to move to a hall just up the road we had booked for the reception afterwards. Before the ceremony formally started I felt rather unwell and had cramps in my stomach, this is when I realised I needed to shit. Not a big deal, I can hold a shit in. After about a minute of these cramps I was in a fair bit of pain and both my dad and my girlfriend who I was sitting next to advised me to go to the toilet as there was still a few minutes until we started the ceremony, and my brother would wait for my anyway. I didn't want to go into one of those public toilets on the beach as they're normally filthy, I would just wait until the ceremony ended, then drive back to my place which was about a 5 minute drive, then head to the reception hall. It was obvious I was in genuine pain and discomfort and they kept telling me to just use the public one, I really fucking wish I had. The ceremony started, and less than 10 seconds after the officiant started speaking, I had a huge fart I needed to let out. You know when you try to let a lot of gas out gradually and silently? This worked for a second, and then I convulsed from my stomach pain, and violently shat myself. Everyone within a couple metres heard it, and smelt it, and after a few seconds everyone knew what had just happened. I was gagging and sprinting towards the toilet trying not to vomit from the thought of what I had just done. I took all my clothes off, tried my best to clean myself and just sat in a cubicle and cried for a few minutes. I had no idea what to do. Girlfriend drove me home and I had a shower and got some new clothes on, it had been 30 minutes now and they still hadn't started. Me and my brother have a very good relationship and he wasn't passing any judgment, and refused to start without me there. As soon as I was there I sat back down and no-one looked at me, just pretended it didn't happen. The ceremony went well from that part forward, and we went to the reception. His now wife and her parents were giving me dirty looks and I just went home straight away and cried some more. Later that night received a bunch of angry texts from his wife and her parents, and my own father. Telling me I had completely ruined the wedding and that I was disgusting and should have gone beforehand. My brother's wife is constantly upset that her wedding will forever be remembered as 'that wedding where my brother in law shit his fucking pants'. She hates me for it. 

I have not shit my pants before, this is not a common thing for me so no, I did not expect that stomach cramps meant I was going to shit myself. I should've gone to the toilet beforehand but I didn't want to hold up the ceremony, AITA?"
"AITA for asking my bf not to do coke at a bachelor party? | I'm 10p% prepared to be TA. My bf (34), who is an elementary school principal, will be attending a bachelor party in San Diego this weekend. The group of guys gets very rowdy/aggresive when drinking. To make matters worse, they almost all (10 mid 30's men) have a ""recreational"" coke habit. My bf used to fo coke when he was younger, but doesn't anymore because I am very against it. Whether it's fear of me finding out or respect for my feelings, I'll never know. I grew up in a family very against drugs (other than weed) and I've never been able to shake my disdain for them. I asked my bf if, given the circumstances, he did do coke this weekend not to tell me. While I would be extremely disappointed, I guess I would understand. However, we are trying to have a baby and doing coke could mess his sperm up for the next 3 months, making it nearly impossible to conceive. 
After explaining this to him, he basically called me an AH saying that I need to make up my mind and that I'm playing mind games. I really didn't intend it that way, I just genuinely don't want to ever know if he does decide to do it. So, Reddit, AITA for asking my bf not to do coke at a bachelor party or asking that if he does he omit that from his story?"
"AITA for being angry that my boyfriend was running 45 minutes late without warning? | So we have been fighting a lot lately about him being insensitive and me being perhaps overly sensitive. Last night, I went to a concert at 8:30 with a friend of his who he knows I don’t find very interesting to be around. Not a bad guy, but not someone I would sign up for 45 minutes alone with. 

BF was supposed to arrive around 8:30. I drove half an hour each way and forewent other social plans for the concert. He was at an important grad school dinner. At 8:45, I text him asking where he is. No response, so I start calling. And he’s clicking the automated response options like “Sorry, I can’t pick up the phone right now.” I’m livid at this point, because if he hasn’t even left at 8:50, he’s going to be very late. 

He arrived around 9:20. I meet him outside so the friend won’t see us fighting. While he says the words “I’m sorry,” he’s also making a number of excuses why when he was already running 25 minutes late, he couldn’t step out to talk to me. But as for why when he knew he’d be late in the first place, he has no reason except “I lost track of the time.” 

I ended up just leaving because I wouldn’t have fun due to my anger. Now I can’t figure out who is the asshole here. I feel heartbroken because I’m considering ending things due to a long pattern of behavior like this. AITA?

&#x200B;

EDITED: I'm not thinking of breaking up with him over this alone. I'm thinking of doing it because something like this happens about once a month, combined with a lot of other fairly thoughtless behavior and a repeated inability to apologize for mistakes."
"AITA for not knowing my girlfriend's Starbucks order? | Hey guys and gals, I have a little problem on my hands right now and was looking for some opinions. My girlfriend just sent me this post on Instagram was like ""if he really loves you he will know your Starbucks order 🥰😊😘☺️"" and stuff like that. We've been together two months and the only time I went to Starbucks with her was when we were still friends, so like I obviously wasn't really paying attention that much idk. She asked if I knew and I said no. Now she's being short with me and she just hit me with the ""K."" When I said sorry, so that means I've royally fucked up I guess. Trust me tho, I know it now and I won't soon forget. I am looking forward to this grill sesh."
"AITA for feeling angry at my gf because of this? | This will be the third MONTH I be together with my girlfriend. She's been um... a bit overreacting about my friends. By her logic I should stop talking to other girls that I've been friends with for years. Once a classmate of mine texted me saying ""I'm lonely"". Gf said that I should've sent her to fu*k off. Which I didn't do. So she started attacking me that I cheat on her and that I lost her trust. By the way she looked inside my massages, since I gave her my pin. Just saying if we are already talking about trust. 
She always says that her heart has been broken way too much and has a hard time trusting again but I don't understand why she has to give me these choices when I did nothing against her. She wanted me to choose between a good friend and her. After that I asked her the same saying ""if I have to get rid of my best friend you should do the same"". Also lately when in or after an argument I sometimes poke her with some sass Like ""you lied when you said that you take everything seriously. It's obvious that you can't take me seriously""

I have no idea about what I've done or have not done."
"AITA for pulling the “I make the money card”? | I work, my wife is a stay at home mom to our boys. I have the upmost love and respect for her doing so. The money I make has always been “our money”, as I feel it should be. She does her part at home, while I do mine at work. I have never said this once in the 5 years she’s been a stay at home mom until today, I swear.

Around Christmas, my wife wanted to get both the boys (them 17 months and 4), iPads. I suggested that we just get a tablet for the oldest as I didn’t think our youngest needed one quite yet and to go with a cheaper, child friendly model with more parental control and a built in case. I also said since it was a big purchase we should discuss it more. I come home the next night from work...and she’s purchased two iPads for the kids. I calmly asked her about it and she said she thought it’d be a good idea, plus our youngest would grow into his. It was the holidays. I didn’t want to fight, so I didn’t. Even when she continued to go above the budget that we had agreed on and hell, that was her idea. We weren’t going destitute over it and the boys were happy...so fine. I’m not going to be the grinch.

7 months later and we now only have one of the iPads. Our youngest smashed his in a tantrum while we were on vacation. And because my wife got these used, there was no insurance. I can’t say he even misses it. 

However, his second birthday is coming up. My wife wants to get him an iPod. I said that after the iPad, I think that’s a terrible idea. She said he loves music and I suggested she just play him some on hers or I’ll use mine. Or as a compromise, we’ll get him a CD player that we have to control that way he doesn’t have a chance of smashing it. She was pushing this iPod Touch.

Eventually, I put my foot down and told her no, that he’s 2 and he doesn’t need another electronic device that he’s just going to break in 2 months. And I told her if she went out and bought one, I’d return it. She got mad and I finally said that I made the money, so I wasn’t going to let her waste it on crap that a 2 year old couldn’t reasonably be expected to take care of. (And yes, I’d keep it out of reach or put the case on it, but she’d take it off or give it back as soon as he got upset that it was bothering him.)

She got mad and we aren’t speaking. I just feel like this is becoming an issue with every birthday. Like she wanted to get our oldest a laptop for his 5th and I asked why he needed one, though she let go of that when she couldn’t explain why a kid going into kindy needed both a tablet and a computer when his parents also had computers.

Am I being an ass here?"
"AITA for refusing to help my wife with her cat? | I recently got back home after a business trip got cut short. I came home 2 weeks ago, and I was surprised to find a cat. 
 
Apparently my wife adopted a cat without my knowledge. I was pretty pissed. I don’t like cats, I’m personally a dog person. And I feel like she took advantage of me. I just said that I’m not going to be taking care of it.
 
Yesterday, she asked me to feed it again. I flat out refused. I already fed it a couple times last week, and that I was straying from my word. Now, she’s mad that I won’t help her with her mistake.
 
So, AITA?"
"AITA for exposing my step mother for cheating in front of the entire family? | My (19F) mother cheated on my father (39M), she left my father for the person she cheated on him with

They married and had children, she stopped seeing me at all when I was 3.

My father raised me and my sister (17F) by himself, until I was 14.

My father then met my step mother who was 24* at the time. 

I hate my step mother, she is a nasty individual- not to me or my siblings (17,2) 

We recently got told that shes pregnant.

Not too long after I snooped on her phone (shitty move, idc) and found out she has been seeing someone else, I only did this because she was acting weird.

I tried to tell my father and he wouldn't listen to me.

I waited until we had a family lunch  and outted her in front of everyone.

My father might be  staying with my step mother and is super pissed, he hasn't left his room yet.

He is devastated 

My grandmother thinks I was an asshole

AITA? I think he deserves to know even if he didn't want to hear it.

Throw away cuz of backlash


I'm 19.

My dad is CURRENTLY 39, he was 20 when I was born 

Edit; typo, she wasnt 20, sorry."
"AITA for being annoyed that my gf got a lift from a guy? | My gf works as a waitresses at a restaurant. Last week a family of 4 came in (dad, mom, 2 kids) and she served them. The next day the dad messaged her on Instagram talking about how it was so cool that modern technology allows people to find people so easily, or something of that ilk.

My gf told me about it and said how it's very strange, and that she feels a little bit bad/guilty for the wife's sake.

Cut to today. My gf is waiting for her bus and it's quite late. She's been waiting for around 40 minutes in the cold and wants to get home because she is going out tonight. The dad who she served rocks up in his van with his friend from work and offers her a lift because he is going that way too.

She accepts the lift. She claims to not be able to see what was wrong with it because she was going that way too. I was obviously quite mad that she'd accepted the lift. Not only was I mad because the whole thing is fucking weird and I never thought she'd do that, but she could have been hurt by these two guys and she just knowingly walked into it like a fucking idiot.

AITA?

EDIT: I find it very hard to wrap my head around why she felt guilty about him messaging, but didn't feel that same guilt about getting a lift from him. She claims she didn't even think at the time."
"AITA for not wanting to be friends with my SIL | Backstory....
Husband (32) and I (32F) have been together 7 years. His brother (26) and wife (25) have been together 5 years. Years ago, after meeting her a few times, my husband casually mentioned what his brothers ""hot little thing will be wearing"".  Fast forward a year or so, SIL is at a party at our house. She mentions to her friends and me that I am too old to get pregnant and I'll be in menopause soon. Brother and SIL continue throughout the years to mention how old my husband and I are. I have chosen to just ignore her because I don't know what else to do...

Fast forward to current, turns out I can't get pregnant due to severe Endo and we have 2 foster toddlers. SIL is now 6 months pregnant with their first. At the last family function, I ignored her, as usual and tended to the toddlers. My husband gets a call a month later from my MIL saying SIL was upset that I ignored her my MIL is upset that I can't be friendly with her. 

My husband wants to talk things out with his brother and SIL and says it's driving a wedge between us and his family. AITA for not wanting to patch things up? I told him I'm not sorry for ignoring her and will continue to do so."
"AITA for drinking all the milk? | I (16F) live, of course, at home with my family. We buy three kinds of milk: dairy milk, almond milk, and chocolate almond milk.

Over the past several days, we've had one carton of dairy milk and three cartons of chocolate almond milk. I don't know how that happened. My father told me and my brother not to drink the dairy milk because he was planning to make a cake with it. We agreed. Chocolate almond milk is eh. It only goes well with cereal.

The next day, my father made the dessert, leaving quite a bit of milk left. He never said he wanted to make more desserts with it, so I assumed it was okay to drink it and I had a mug of milk a day for three days, leaving just a small bit of milk left.

Today, my father yelled at me for drinking all the milk when he'd told me it was reserved for cake, and so my brother also ended up berating me because I ruined the chances of having another tasty cake. I argued that I didn't know he was planning to make more than just the one cake. They argued that I had three whole cartons of chocolate almond milk to drink. I think I should be allowed to drink dairy milk if I so please. It tastes significantly better.

Something along these lines happens every time I drink the dairy milk. Usually it's because my brother and father hate almond milk so they think because I don't hate it I should have to drink almond milk with my mother. In this particular case though, I know I could have asked if it was okay to drink the milk, but my father never specified he was going to make more than one cake. AITA?"
"AITA for spending my Sons lottery winnings money? | I have a wife (Wilhelma, 40) and two sons (Sam, 17, and Scott, 16).  6 years ago, I ran to the gas station to buy some cigarettes.  Instead of abandoning my family (just a joke) I decided to also buy a lottery ticket for everyone, just for fun.  It was a blast.  We all talked all night about what we would do with our winnings, where we would go, etc.  I mean, this was all fantasy anyway, right?  But I specifically told my kids that they would have to share their winnings, and they would have to put it away for college first and foremost.  Well wouldn't you know it, Sams ticket won.  Of course its actually MY ticket, and I had to claim it.  It didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k.  I sat them both down and explained that I was going to save it all for college, but we could celebrate/splurge a little.  They absolutely wanted a gaming system, and Wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed.  We all agreed on this, and saving the rest.

&#x200B;

I bought the gaming system and a bunch of games for about $1k.  Wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on a Disney World trip.  The boys don't even like Disney, but it was always Wilhelma's dream to go so we went.  Another $5k.  Last year, Sam wanted a car.  Wilhelma was pretty tired of chauffeuring them around anyway, so I agreed and spent ""his"" $4k on a car.  I pay the insurance, registration, and maintenance under the agreement that he takes over driving Scott to his stuff as well.  Wilhelma had no complaints about any of these purchases.  

&#x200B;

Since day 1, I've actually invested the entire winnings and never dipped into it.  I've always spent my OWN money on all this stuff.  I have invested better than average, and that $60k is now $100k.  Wilhelma knows I have always invested our money, but it was always small amounts since we're poor.  She knows I was investing the lottery winnings as well.  I've always told her about the money doing well, but I guess I never explicitly said how well.  She also has never asked, as she has left our finances completely up to me.  

&#x200B;

Sam is starting college in a few weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years.  While looking at the portfolio, Wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how.  I told her I invested the $60k and grew it to $100k.  She then asked why we're only giving Sam $30K when it should be $50k.  I said no, the other $40k is mine.  I managed this account, I made the investments, I did all of the work.  Plus I paid for all that other stuff through our other savings. The $40k stays and I'll keep investing it.  If the boys NEED the money, its there, but if not I'm gonna eventually retire a little early with it.  She thinks I'm stealing ""his"" money since I wouldn't have been able to invest with it if I didn't have it to begin with.  I say its always kinda been my money, and I'm still giving him the $30k I promised him since the beginning."
"AITA For wanting an old lady do a hard job and letting others do her easy job? | So I know the title sounds confusing, but let me clear it up. 

I work at a factory and I do one of the hardest jobs there. Dropping. It's when you grab something twist your upper body and put them in a slot. It goes very fast. So imagine standing in one spot on a concrete floor, spending 4 hours or more twisting your spine non stop. 

On the other had there's a super easy job, called rejects where you get bad jars, open the plastic there're wrapped in and put it on a cart. Once the cart is full you take it to the top of the line. It's super easy and relaxing.

My problem is that this older lady always takes the reject job, forcing everyone to do harder jobs. We don't get assigned jobs and we are all paid the same. 

Yesterday, she was ""tired"" And didn't want to work hard, forcing the droppers to to do her job on top of our own. And yes, she can drop and do other things. She only takes the reject so that she can walk around and talk.

I've mentioned this to people but so far only my friend agrees with me and everyone else on the line thinks just because she's older, she should get easy jobs. 

And no, she isn't frail. When the bell at the end of the day rings, she pushes and runs her way to be one of the first out the door. 

I don't think I'm the A but she is older and no body else agrees which makes me think I'm wrong...."
"AITA for not washing a dish and thinking my bfs relationship with his mom is creepy? | Me (22F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been together for two years. His mom recently bought a house in our town with her boyfriend to be closer to her son (my bf). I first met her about 6 months ago when she moved into her new home. 

Recently my bf had his wisdom teeth pulled. His mom and I both went to the apt where she cried the whole time that “her baby” was going to be “in so much pain”. I comforted her but was honestly confused why she was having such a strong reaction to a routine procedure. He ended up staying with her for a week and I wasn’t allowed to see him during that time. He said his mom wanted him “resting” since he just “had a trauma” (again, routine wisdom teeth extraction). He decided to stay another week and I was getting upset because I wanted to see him. He got his mom to agree to let me come for 30 minutes but the whole time she seemed irritated I was there. I asked him where he was sleeping since she only has one bedroom and he said he was in bed with her while her bf sleeps on the couch. They all seemed to think this was normal but again, I find it kind of creepy for a 26 year old to be sleeping in bed with his mom. I didn’t say this out loud but anyway, he ended up telling me I need to leave bc his mom really wants him to rest. 

He decided to stay ANOTHER week (note: while he’s there he was being spoon fed baby food by his mom because he was “too fragile” to have solid food after the wisdom tooth extraction 2 weeks prior). He agreed to come home (to his house not mine) for a weekend and have me stay over. His mom protested but he told her he’s going home and that’s that. She knew I was staying over and told him I’m manipulative. He said he “wasn’t ready” for solid food so at night when he got super hungry, I made him soup. I didn’t wash the dishes because it was late and we went right to bed. In the morning, I got up to go to work and figured I’ll wash the dishes when I get home (bf was taking time off work to recover). His mom popped in for a surprise visit and lost it that I didn’t wash the dishes and said I’m “no real woman”. He told me this and I finally lost it and told him he needs to stand up for me or it’s over and said his moms behavior is inappropriate. My BF says I’m TA for disrespecting his mom and being a slob. What are your thoughts Reddit. AITA?

Edit/Update: yeah we ended things today. I can’t stand this behavior and am really glad so many people here encouraged me to see I’m not wrong for thinking this is weird"
"AITA for wanting to take custody of a certain nephew or not at all? | My SIL and brother were hit by a drunk driver and died a month ago. They had 3 kids which are currently with SILs mother. We figured she’d end up taking custody, but because the kids are 3,1,2months and the mother herself has 3 kids she doesn’t want to keep all three. She agreed to keep the 1 year old since he’s not related to us(SIL cheated) but wonders if we could take the other two. 

The problem is me and my other brother both agreed we’d take a kid in if we had to. I said I’d take the 3 year old but that’s it. If I couldn’t get him then I’m not taking any child in at all. 

My brother also wants the 3 year old because he has a baby himself and thinks it would be too hard to have two kids under 6 months. Everyone thinks I’m being an asshole and that I should just take the baby but honestly I can’t stand the crying so I couldn’t do it. So AITA for choosing which kid I take in?

Edit: everyone is saying they should stay together. Regardless if me or my brother were to decide we want them all, we can’t keep them together. SILs mother will NOT give us the middle kid because he’s got no relation to us

Edit: besides the crying and me not being able to handle that, I would be able to fit the 3 year old into my schedule since he can go to daycare and he starts school in the fall while still working and going to college"
"AITA for wanting my fiancée to share her bonus? | A couple things upfront. I make about twice as much as my fiancé does. She makes 60k, while I make 110k. The thing is, she gets a pretty huge bonus. I don’t get a bonus, while she gets about 5k.
 
We do have shared finances now, but I do pay more for the house, food, and our joint account compared to her. I think that’s absolutely fair. The thing is, she’s not willing to share her bonus. I don’t know why? I put more into our lives, and she’s not gracious enough to share her bonus. I’ve tried talking to her, but she won’t change her opinion.
 
Am I truly in the wrong? AITA?
 
Edit: Just to clarify. When I asked if I could take 5k for myself from my income, she said no.
 
Edit 2: I think the best solution is for us not to share finances now. We can both pay the same amount. Thanks guys!"
"AITA for suggesting my sister loose weight ? | My sister is one year older than me and started college this year . She wasn’t thin or a healthy weight before she left , and she’s only gained weight . I know her eating habits - she basically only eats fast food /junk food. She’s obviously overweight but I did not make any comments shaming her or her body . Even though when I was underweight she would frequently make fun of me for being a “skeleton” and gross looking . Anyway, I simply said maybe she should look into eating healthier , counting her calories and exercising with me while she was home for the weekend . She got very offended and doesn’t think her taunting of me when I was skinny is the same when I comment on her being overweight . So am I an asshole ? I’m not only concerned for her appearance though, two years ago she had high cholesterol and she was only 17. I think she would feel better about herself too if she were to loose some weight ."
"AITA: For Giving My Brother a Chicken Sandwich for Christmas. | Every year my parents hold a gift exchange at their home on Christmas Eve and my older brother and I always give each other thoughtful, but funny gifts. This year, he became vegan, because his wife wanted them to follow a new diet.  Something he complied with despite not liking it.

For our gift exchange, I decided to buy him two Popeye’s chicken sandwiches, since he did not get to participate in all the hype and a new PS4 controller. Before the exchange, my girlfriend and I bought the sandwiches, put them in an insulated bag and wrapped the bag.

When my brother unwrapped his gift, he was confused about why I got him a bag, until I told him to open it. When he saw the sandwiches, he started to laugh hysterically and immediately unwrapped one of them and ate it. The gift was a big hit, except to my sister in law. Afterward, she scolded me, by saying she didn’t appreciate me giving my brother food that goes against her beliefs.

I told her that brother is an adult that can make his own decisions and it made him happy, besides I wasn't even thinking about her beliefs when I did it.

She turned bright red and stormed off.

Later, I got a text from my brother telling me he was in hot water for eating the sandwiches, but he didn’t care. He appreciated the gift regardless.

Now the topic of conversation in our family group chat is some people are saying; it was insensitive to my sister in law to get my brother the sandwiches, when others think it was brilliant.

So Reddit what is your opinion?

Edit:  Thank you for everyone that commented.  I will accept my asshole verdict and apologize to everyone that is now craving a sandwich with this post."
"AITA for asking my GF not to sing and dance in public? | I'm not against singing and dancing and enjoying yourself. If it is at home i would encourage it even. In public i hate attention and can't stand people looking at me, if it's not just a passerby-look. My GF knows this but says singing and dancing is great and everyone should do it more, which i aggree with - just not in public, when I'm with her - that's all i ask for.

She does it regularly in the city, supermarkets, etc. She just sings or dances. She doesn't dance badly but it's nothing special and some of the moves are just embarrassing. Her singing is another story - she is completely tone deaf and knows it. She knows it sounds terrible but doesn't hear it herself.

People just look at us and watch or listen and make comments and i hate it. I just want her to stop when im with her. But she won't. AITA here?

&#x200B;

Edit: Kind of crazy how many people say ""break up with her"". There are 1000 things that i love about her and there is 1 inconvenience. Even if she sang all the time i wouldn't just break up because of that. Things are fine. relax yourselves."
"AITA for not cuddling with my girlfriend when she’s on her period | I(27m) live with my gf(24f) and she tends to blend through her pads often.

Well yesterday she had another period had wanted me to cuddle with her. I did this before and ended up with a red stain on my pants. I told her no and she flipped out on me for being an asshole and said that I was selfish. I didn’t mean to sound rude or anything I just think that getting the blood on me is gross. AITA"
"AITA (21f) for not seeing the ""problem"". | A hint of context - I'm childfree, I don't want kids, I have never wanted kids, kids have never been in my life plan.

 My Fiancé and i have been together for 6 years, dating 5, engaged 1. 

I'm currently 14 days late, and sicker than a dog that's eaten chocolate. 

Earlier this week my Fiancé (22M) noticed my lack of period and reminded me that we ran out of protection for 3 days at the end of last month, he did it so calmly that I hadn't realized what he was implying. 

I thought ""huh that's weird but oh well christmas shopping needs done"" and went on about my life as status quo. 

This where the asshole question comes into play.

I'm a smoker, outside and but often, and with my stomach and the holidays stressing me out I'm up to quarter a pack a day, my Fiancé wakes up to me chilling on the porch calm as a cucumber and minding my own business, and starts screaming about smoking while pregnant. 

I'm not and I told him just as much, but it sadly doesn't end there. 
He starts accusing me of not taking a test because I hate children, and saying I'm ignoring the obvious.

I inform him of the following important tid-bits

A) I have Endo and Crohn's, my stomach is always a mess.

B) I'm a grown women, I know my body.

C) I wouldn't be keeping it even if that was the ""problem""

I'm a student with big plans that don't include unplanned children, I've never hidden this fact.

He thinks I'm TA for not ""caring enough to take a test"", potentially harming his unborn son and not considering what he wants for my life and my body.

My friends are split between me being totally right, and me being in denial and inconsiderate so I figured I'd leave it all to y'all.

TLDR: Am I the asshole for knowing my body and not wasting a dollar to confirm nor deny his accusations?

Editing for an Update:
3 negatives and I'm still getting the on/off silent treatment. He's now insisting on a blood test, because his mother ""dreamt of a son and she's never wrong about these things."""
"AITA for wanting my jobless roommate to wear headphones while I WFH? | Obviously current and topical. I work from home, have since we moved in, so I have a home office and she has the master with a much better bathroom and closet. We're both on the lease, both pay the same rent, but now she doesn't have a job, and might not have one until June/July.

That's stressful for me, since I'll have to pay the full amount of the rent if she can't (she's already admitted she only has the next three months, which means I'd be on the hook for July, but apparently isn't concerned about it because she thinks there'll be some sort of check sent her way at some point. She doesn't qualify for unemployment, and I don't want to rely on checks that may never come). Since I want to get ahead of this and make sure I have money for the rent, I've been adjusting my schedule and trying to do more work, meet more deadlines, work on the weekend if I have to. I get paid 60-90 days out so it's important I work extra now to pay July rent.

The only thing I've asked from her is that she wear headphones while watching videos in her room, something she's been doing a lot since she's not working. She asked when I need her to be quiet, so I told her noon to six (I compromised since she doesn't want to wear them all day). She's decided this is ""unreasonable"" and she absolutely won't—went off on me for it.

&#x200B;

Compromises I've come up with:

I close my door like she wants and put my dog in her crate so she doesn't bark all day (I leave the office door open so she can come and go and not bark). She doesn't want my dog to be stuck in her crate but wants my door closed.

She watch videos from a different spot in the house where I can't hear her. She doesn't want this because her cat likes to hang out in her room and she wants to be with her, also she thinks she should be able to do whatever she wants in her room as long as the door is closed\*.

I move out. She didn't want that, probably doesn't want to have to pay the rent or find a new roommate.

She move out, I cover the full amount of the rent. She doesn't feel this would be ""fair to me financially"" which I think is ridiculous.

I also offered her my nice spare headphones since she says wearing earbuds for six hours hurt her ears, but she won't take them.

&#x200B;

(\*She also thinks I shouldn't bother her in her room if she doesn't want to be bothered, but that I should knock on her door if she's being too loud and she'll lower the volume, but she won't wear headphones if she thinks the volume is low enough, even if it's bothering me.)

&#x200B;

The entire conversation was exhausting, I kept trying to offer a solution and disengage and she wouldn't stop arguing with me even when I offered to just pay her rent so she can move out. I had to tell her ""I'm done talking about this"" to make her stop it.

Am I the asshole here? She keeps insisting I'm being ""unreasonable"" expecting her to wear headphones since it's her house too. But she also won't accept literally any other compromise I come up with.

&#x200B;

ETA: should've mentioned I'm self-quarantining because of definite exposure to COVID-19 and symptoms following, so I can't go out of my house at all."
AITA for not buying my partner McDonald’s when he’s trying to eat healthier | My partner has been on a “health kick” lately in order to lose some weight and feel more fit. He’s decided to cut out unhealthy foods and go mostly keto. Yesterday i decided to order some McDonald’s to the house and when it arrived he was angry i didn’t get him any. I’ve been cooking him healthy meals and urge him to stay away from unhealthy items. I try to encourage him everyday to be active and work out but he always pushes back on that front.   I was hungry and made an unhealthy decision for myself and ate it in a different room from him. AITA for not getting him McDonald’s? It’s caused a giant fight about how i should’ve got him food but i believe that would’ve had negative impacts on his goals?
"WIBTA if I only pay half a huge vet bill after a dog fight because owners waited a week to get their dog vet treatment resulting in massive infection? | Edited: the question about vet fees not whose at fault for fight. 
So about a week ago a new dog came to our off lead dog park, My ginormous dopey rescue was over zealous in her greeting, new dog didn’t like like it/her, snapped at her face, my dog retaliated and a 15 second fight ensued. My dog had a few scrapes but other dog had 2 punctures in her back. I broke the fight up, gave my dog to my hubby to hold and went back to assist with the older lady walking the other dog. I apologised profusely as my dog was the one to approach and she had injured the other dog which was an older collie type. I apologised profusely again and told the lady we would cover the vet bills and that she needed to get her dog seen to ASAP as bites get infected really fast. I offered to drive her to the nearby 24hr emergency vet then or help her get the dog to a vet the following day. She said “I’ll see how she is in the morning” I said you really should go today or tomorrow due to infection risk, reassured we’d pay for it, and to call me when she was at the vet so we could pay over the phone. She agreed, she gave us her number so we left a message on her machine with our contact details ect.

We didn’t hear anything the next day, so left another message to follow up and offer assistance again, still heard nothing. 

Fast forward to today, 8 days after incident, lady’s husband called to say that they took the dog to the vet TODAY as her wounds were really infected, Dog required surgery to clean out infected wounds as well as a heap of antibiotics. Cost of vet bills now in the thousands, all because owner left it for a week and allowed a raging infection to set on rather than seeking help after the incident to prevent this situation. I’ve told the owner that we will pay for half which is way more than it would have cost for early intervention but he’s furious and saying we have to pay it all because our dog did the initial damage to which i agreed that yes she did bite, but it’s not our fault the animal was left untreated for over a week and got really sick and that we tried in every way to help but heard nothing back 
Should i pay the whole bill? I know our dog and we took responsible action as our was at fault but I feel as though we shouldn’t have to be out of pocket for them neglecting to seek vet care for their dog in an acceptable time frame. 
Note: our dog is now on lead all the time now and we’ve got her a silicons muzzle for when she’s out around other dogs"
"AITA for claiming my (16M) reward from a bet with my little brother (10M)? | This really isn't a big deal, but I just wanted to know.

So this friday, me and my family were watching TV and saw an ad for a new episode of the show ""Ninja Warrior"". Our country's version of this show is fairly new, im not sure how long its there in the US.

Someone (not sure who) asked what season this is, and I said 2 and my dad agreed. My brother said it was the 3rd season and we told him it isn't. We told him it isn't and argued a bit, and right before I opened up google to see it, my mom said as a joke we should bet on it.

I said let's bet for a chocolate bar, and my dad, who knew I was right, told my brother we should bet on principle (I googled it and I think it's called ""Gentlemen's bet"", sorry, translating this from the original conversation is weird). My brother insisted he was right and was very confident, and I told him if he's so sure lets bet on the chocolate bar. He agreed even though my dad didn't like it.

I googled it, and to no surprise, it was the 2nd season, my brother tried to argue and claim it wasn't and how he remembers it's the 3rd season, and I told him that if he can't prove it, then I won the bet.

A few minutes later, when we were at the kitchen, I went to take the chocolate bar he had from his drawer, and my parents told me not to, and that I shouldn't take it from him. (probably cause he's young and they felt bad)

I insisted that I won the bet, and even though he doesn't accept it, I proved there were only 2 season. After some convincing, eventually my brother agreed even though he didnt think there were 2 seasons. My parents were still unhappy with it, but knew its my brother's decision. I ate the chocolate bar.

&#x200B;

To me it looks like I won fairly, and that I actually taught him a lesson about losing, and that he's got to know he's gonna lose some bets in life, where my parents won't be there to help. Later, when I talked to my friends they said it's a bit asshole-ish because it's his chocolate bar and he's a 10 year old boy.

&#x200B;

I know this is very insignifact and silly, because its just a stupid chocolate bar, but AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm seeing mixed comments here between YTA and NAH, and I accept them all, I realize how I was an asshole and how I wasn't and want to wait for more feedback, but I wanted to ask about my parents. Was what they did okay? I'm honestly not sure. I know they didn't want his candy taken, but he clearly got into this bet knowing what it means, he's not an idiot, and regardless of it being a bet with me, shouldn't they let him make the decision on wether to fight about it alone?

Also want to mention incase it matters, that it wasn't a big argument. my parents aren't angry at me and so isn't my brother. not sure if this changes things."
"AITA for refusing to go out and buy my pregnant wife’s cravings on a few occasions? | She’s getting these “cravings” randomly and out of the blue. It’s usually always junk food too and random combinations of food. Usually it requires me to leave the house to get them. 

She doesn’t want to drive to get them (I’m ok with that, we live in an area where it snows and the roads have been icy). However now she’s treating me like I’m the worst dude in the world. 

The last few times she has asked me to go and buy one of her cravings I’ve refused. Most of the time I’ve just been relaxing at home after work. 

It’s not my fault she usually doesn’t tell me until after I get home. Yesterday at about this time she wanted me to get her yogurt with fudge nuts and all this stuff from this yogurt place like 25 mins away. 

I refused, she kept asking and said I’m just unsupportive and a sucky husband. 

She hasn’t talked to me for a full day. Am I in the wrong? Are these cravings really that strong ?"
"WIBTA if I didn't pay a tip to a spa when they charge a ""living wage surcharge""? | I'm normally a good tipper.  20% is normal, but I'm OK with more depending on the situation.  

Yesterday, I booked a spa package for my wife and MIL.  Relatively nice place, with treatments costing north of 200 bucks each.  As I'm talking, the woman on the phone taking the information lets me know there is a ""living wage surcharge of 3%""

Here's the AITA bit.  I usually tip well, as noted, but when there is a *mandated tip* (such as for a party of 8 or more), that's all you get.  If you charge me 15% percent for my party of 8, or a 10% for a ""service fee"", well, that's what you wanted so that's what you get.  I'm not going to tip on top of a mandated tip.  I'm not even going to pay the difference between the mandated portion and what I would have paid otherwise. 

The ""living wage surcharge"" is just galling.  If you are forced by law to (or simply want to) pay your employees more, that's your issue.  If you want to pass the costs on to the consumer,  fine.  Raise your prices like every other business does.  If you present me with a ""surcharge"", I'm treating that as a mandatory tip.  

I feel bad for the masseuses, because a 3% tip sucks, but I feel like it's their employer who fucked them over, not me.  Besides...assuming they are now getting a ""living wage"", which is reasonably inferred from the presence of the surcharge, it's not like they are one of those workers whose compensation scheme is based upon tips, right?"
"AITA for walking into my regular sushi spot 15 minutes before their kitchen closed? | So I too work in the food industry, leading me to have conflicting opinions. My favorite sushi place closes their kitchen at 10:15, and fully closes their bar at 10:30. I had gotten off work late and was craving it, plus they have reverse happy hour from 9PM-CLOSE. My boyfriend and I walk in at 10 pm, there are about 5 tables left but they’re obviously finishing up. When we sit down we order right away and pretty much eat everything right as it comes. I felt kind of OK about the timing because I feel restaurants are open until a certain time for a reason, plus there were other tables. 

I started to feel pretty shitty when their employees started sweeping and mopping (which I totally understand, you don’t need to wait for the last people to be done to start this). The two servers cleaning the floor were just loudly shoving the tables and chairs, not picking anything up and we were sitting right next to them; I felt so bad/like I shouldn’t be there haha. In the end we technically were the last table to leave, there were a few people at the bar but... 

AITA? Should one know to never go out to eat 15 mins before a restaurant closes, even if you finish eating around the same time as the other tables? (I ended up tipping a few extra dollars because I felt bad and understood we may have been crossing the unknown standard some servers feel)"
"AITA for drawing a woman? | I knowthe title is stupid, I just couldn’t think of something else.

I (F19) have been drawing since I was 9. I started with the usual weeb-stuff (manga) and moved on to drawing portraits. At 16 I stopped drawing/painting completely because of my mental health, which made me lose interest in everything I liked before. 

Recently, I tried to better myself inevery way: I started drinking less, went to therapy, went the gym and started sketching again. 

Tonight, I was in a café and because my phone was dying, I was digging in my backpack and found my old sketchbook, so I started drawing random people from the café. I didn‘t stare at them,  I only took quick looks every now and then and noone noticed, except for this one lady.

After I finished sketching her she came up to me and confronted me about how i disturbed her evening by looking at her and how much of an asshole I was. I told her that I was sorry and that I was only practicing sketching. She became furious and told me that that was inappropriate. I told her she could have the page of my sketchbook, because I thought she was scared of me posting it online (which I didn‘t intend to, my sketches are not that good and I don‘t have a platform anyways). She got even more angry, telling me she „didn‘t want that piece of shit“ and stormed out. I was left with people looking at me out of curiosity and I felt like shit. 

So reddit, AITA?i"
"WIBTA if I called out my wife's sister? | So me and my wife originally shared a house in a town close to her parents. Sister in law, let's call her Morgan, has lived at home rent free forever, other than a short time she moved in with a bf and then moved home. 

A little while ago my wife and I found out we were having a baby girl! Super exciting but we made the decision to move in with the parents to save as much money as possible. So this means we now live with the two parents, two dogs, 3 cats, a fish, the sister, and a frog. So quite a cramped living situation, but it's no biggie for a while.

Now coming to the sister. She is the most entitled, selfish, ridiculous person I've ever met. She will start crying and yelling if you say ANYTHING to her that could possibly be construed as anything bad. Even to the point at where she is getting upset and freaking out if I ask her to move some fully used bottles of moisturizer (literally just garbage) from the bathroom to make some room for our stuff. 

The rest of the family is tip toeing around her at all times so she doesn't get upset, and I am getting to the end of my rope with her and how differently my wife and the sister get treated by parents. 

It's always the same story, the parents build up and talk to her about something, she freaks out, has a tantrum, leaves the house after calling the whole family names (some nasty stuff) and then waltzes in a couple days later like nothing happened with no apologies and no consequences. The parents never ever follow through with any consequences and she is holding all of us emotionally hostage so that we are just trying to not have her freak out. 

I have written down some points I want to bring up to the sister, but dont want to create any drama in the family, especially if we all have to live together for a while longer. A big problem with how this works with the sister is that my wife is treated like an adult and held responsible for anything she does (as she should be) and receives no help but the sister gets anything she wants (Ie. A car, free schooling, no rent, etc). This very negatively affects my wife and it's getting to me too.

So WIBTA if I were to bring my issues up with the sister most likely causing a huge amount of drama and shit to hit the fan, but possibly leading to big change?




Edit: as I suspected I would 100% be the AH and overstepping my bounds as someone living under their roof by saying anything directly to the sister. I may end up having a calm convo with the parents but in the end I think it's best to knuckle under for now and not become involved.

Thank you everyone for your input and for all bringing good points!"
"AITA for calling out my girlfriend's suspicious behavior? | So first a little background. My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a month. Things have been going pretty well until fairly recently. The last few times we have hung she has been texting this guy, let's call him Matt. Whenever I glance at her phone while she's texting this Matt, she'll cover up her phone, and when I ask why, she'll get super defensive. Well recently I confronted her about this (I've been cheated on before, and I know the signs) and she said that she would cover it up because she and him were talking about personal things. She didn't give a reason for being defensive when I asked about it though. Who's the asshole here?

Edit: We've been official and exclusive for about a month, we did have a but of a thing before that, she won't tell me anything whatsoever about Matt, like not even how they met, and in theory were going to talk it out today around 6:30, I'll tell you all how it plays out

Edit 2: The guys real name is not Matt, I did that for anonymity's sake, sorry for any slip ups, I'll correct them if I make them

Edit 3: Thank you for all of this, all of your comments and opinions have helped, I didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did, I'm talking it out with her now, and am gonna talk to her about it tomorrow in person

Edit 4: We talked it out, she agreed that what she did was suspicious, and I agreed that I was kinda projecting my fears onto her. There's still some distance, but that seems normal considering the circumstances. Anyways thank you all for your help, and if there are any new updates I'll let you all know.

EDIT 4: GOD DAMN WAS IT WORSE THAN I THOUGHT. She was cheating. On her other long-distance boyfriend. With me. Granted it wasn't the person in the post. She just told me about it and broke up with me like that. She lied to me about how she felt for the entire relationship. I know how I was judged, but I am definitely not the asshole here."
"AITA for evicting my son for moving in his girlfriend? | I own several properties and rent them out. My son is 20 and goes to school near one of the properties (10-unit luxury apartment). It's cheaper to let him live there rent-free than living in the dorms. Obviously the condo is MUCH larger (three bedrooms, 2 bath, gym on-site) private, quieter, etc. I put several conditions on his living there rent-free. Nothing shocking; no smoking (he doesn't), no parties, keep the place clean, turn off the lights when you leave AND no moving people in. A couple of months ago, I noticed that the utilities at the condo skyrocketed because he moved in his girlfriend. His girlfriend was having issues with her roommates. To add insult to injury, this girl moved in her friend who came out to LA to be an actress and had no where to go. I told my son I didn't give a fuck what problems these girls were having - no roommates or he can move out. He lied to me about their moving out. I told him again - no roommates - or leave. He started playing with semantics how they're not really moved in and just spends a night or two. I don't give a fuck. I could be charging 4K a month for the condo (this is Westwood, CA) and by letting them stay there, it puts me at risk of their claiming tenant rights. That could cost me tens of thousands of dollars in lost rent and legal fees. And if that's not bad enough, his girlfriend talks about the condo as if it's ""their"" condo.

&#x200B;

Rather than fight with him, again, I asked my property manager to begin the eviction process on my son. I treat him no differently than people who don't pay their rent. I told my son I ain't paying for his boarding at school and his ass is going to pay rent if he moves back home. The commute from my house to UCLA is a bitch. He's not 12. I don't owe him anything. He should be kissing my ring for paying for tuition and keeping him on my insurance plan.

&#x200B;

And, no, I am not officially renting out the place to either of them. They don't have money, the credit or respect to qualify to rent one of my properties out."
"AITA for forcing my 15y old son into doing track? | My son would be a total shut in if his mom and I allowed him total freedom.  Recently, we enrolled him in track in order to get him doing regular exercise. His twin sister is in track and it's just as easy to have them both do it. His doctor recommended exercise to help him with coordination and ADHD.

&#x200B;

We've been asking him all year what sport he wants to do. None has been the constant answer.

&#x200B;

He's complaining every day, dragging his feet at every practice and generally making everyone else miserable at home.

&#x200B;

Mom is strongly for it, and I am more uncertain, but we agreed to do it i am backing her up on this, but have misgivings.  I did no sports in school at all, and my parents never made me do anything extra-curricular.  MY wife on the other hand was required by her parents to do a ton of extra stuff during school. (Mostly to keep her busy and out of the house according to the wife)

&#x200B;

I feel like we are doing the right thing despite his hatred of it.  He is very awkward right now and uncoordinated, and his fitness level has tanked this year compared to last year when he still had PE classes (which aren't required in his grade)

&#x200B;

Are we the assholes?

&#x200B;

 Edit: **Thanks for all your comments**. He and I have talked about it and we both reviewed everyone's comments. I think he understands why we want this, and that it's our responsibility as parents. He still doesn't want to do it and we agreed to talk more about it after talking to the coach. "
"AITA for planning to take legal action against my siblings over inheritance? | My father passed away when I was quite young, leaving my younger sister, brother and I alone with our mother. When this happened he passed his family home to her, and she and my sister (31) have been living in it until my mother passed away last year due to an accident. Every thing was split evenly between the three of us, but due to my sisters condition despite it legally belong to us all, the family home is being used by her and her alone.

My sister, Talia, does not leave the home and has never held a job. Ever since her teenage years she has shut herself inside and is incapable of even going outside to get groceries. I personally think she has only gotten to this point due to being enabled by my mother, but whatever the reasoning she's entrenched in her ways. Now that my mother has passed, Talia lives in the house and refuses to even discuss the possibility of selling or renting it out.

When I first brought up the idea of selling the home not only Talia but my brother, Robert, got upset. He thinks due to the house prices in our area if we were to sell the home, Talia would have to move to an entirely different area away from her family and outside of her comfort zone. When I suggested to him that perhaps he take her in to live with his own family instead if he found that so objectionable, he told me I was being ridiculous and that wasn't an option. After multiple debates over this topic I relented and let things lie for a few months, figuring that after some time has passed and things weren't so fresh I could approach it again.

My wife and I recently arranged another meeting between Talia, Robert and I and brought up the idea of renting out the other rooms of the house to roommates or maybe converting the lower story of the house into an airbnb. I even offered to set up the advertisements and my wife said she could help tidy things up and create a nice space for people to stay in. We live in an extremely busy area so business would go extremely well and Talia, Robert and I would all be able to benefit from the house rather than just Talia. Talia stormed off mid meeting after saying she would not live with a bunch of strangers. Robert is taking her side and telling me to lay off and drop the topic completely.

I don't think it's fair that just Talia is getting to take advantage of a house that technically belongs to me just as much as her. I'm considering seeing a lawyer to see what I can have done so I'm not completely shafted by this affair, but when I shared my plans with some friends some of them reacted pretty badly and think that if I get the law involved Robert won't ever forgive me, and that family bonds are more important than money. My wife is backing me completely and thinks that Talia is being a brat and Robert is enabling her.

I'm set on my decision, but I'm wondering how this looks from the outside."
"AITA for not feeling comfortable with my long distance girlfriend hanging out 1 on 1 in her apartment with another guy at night? | A little background info: My girlfriend and I began a long distance relationship soon after we both finished school. We have been dating going on 5 years now and have been in the LDR for 1.5 years.

Last night, she hung out 1 on 1 in her apartment with a guy she met from an adult sports league (they met a few months back, but still play together regularly). I was a little jealous when I heard what she was doing, but I tried to keep my cool in order to not be the automatic 'asshole'. I texted her goodnight around 10:20 my time (11:20 hers), then laid in bed for a few minutes and my mind began racing. I started wondering what kind of stuff they were up to and, I have to admit, my mind got the best of me. I trolled around reddit and some other websites for about 10 minutes to see if this situation was normal and if I should say something. I did.

Here is my text: ""I will admit that it's really kind of weird that you're hanging out one on one with \[insert name here\] at 1130 on a Friday night."" This was sent \~10 minutes after my goodnight text.

I thought this was reasonable. She would quell my fears and I could just go to sleep. 30 minutes go by with no response. An hour then goes by... I give up waiting. She didn't text me back until 9:30am (her time). I would have chalked this up to her falling asleep, but her excuse was that she 'just didn't want to deal with it last night'. Regardless of this being the real reason, this response really hurt.

Rewinding to about 4 years ago, we had a similar situation (albeit more severe) where she was repeatedly hanging out with a guy 1 on 1 in her room at college (we went to the same school). This guy called me the ""epitome of douche"" and was trying to get her to break up with me. At first, she wouldn't admit it. I had to call her out on information from her roommates in order to hear the whole story from her. She said they never did anything together and I told her I trusted her. 

Last night, I got flashbacks to the same situation. This time, I don't have the roommates to help determine if it is purely platonic and to hear the whole story. I vocalized all of this in a phone call with her about an hour ago and now she says I am being controlling and that she 'just won't ever do anything on the weekends again'. I am not trying to be controlling, but I totally understand where she is coming from (I stayed in the same state as college and still have friends here where she does not where she is). I just don't think she thinks it is as big of a deal as I do, especially her not texting back and the given history of this kind of situation.  

TL;DR: My LDR girlfriend hung out alone in her apartment with a guy last night. I told her that what she was doing didn't make me feel comfortable and she didn't respond until the morning. Her response was that she doesn't have many friends there and just wanted to do something. This sort of thing has happened in the past and I had to call her out on information from her roommates in order to hear the whole story from her. We talked on the phone this morning where I told her that and she called me controlling and thinks I am overreacting.

AITA??

"AITA for not giving my sister my car | Hello Reddit, sorry for formating, I'm on mobile. Also, this happend back in december, I finally have enough time to post it. Let's start with the story 
The cast: my sister(F,20), my parents(65), me(M,32), my wife(F,31) and my extended family. Let's start with the basics, me and my uncle are the only people in the family that can actually drive like a sane person and can spot a difference between a chevy cobalt and a school bus. But he is not really all that involved into family life since we all live in San Diego while he moved to Sydney back in 2008. My sister, as everybody else in the family got pregnat at the age of 20. She didn't go to college beacuse she considers it uselles and a waste of time and money, she also works at McDonald's. My parents gave her their 1992 corolla when she turned 16 under the condition that they can drive it too sometimes beacuse they can't afford a new car. 
Needless to say that they didn't give me a car when I was 16. I was always the family abomination, to the adition that I am liberal and pan, I am the only one that graduated from college, and don't have any kids at 32! Imagine how selfish of me not to have kids at 32! As expected, the corolla died after 27 years, I sometimes really felt sorry for the poor car. I know pretty well that my sister's boyfriend can afford to buy a car, he is buying her some really expensive stuff and she only works beacuse my parents woud throw her out of the house if she didn't have a job. Now, I myself am a massive car guy and a car nerd. Since I spent some time at college and not breeding, doing drugs and drinking alchohol I have quite nice paying job.
I'm also a pretty cheap person and am able to save quite a bit of cash even tho I'm paying a massive loan for my house (as you may know houses in San Diego are pretty fucking expensive, my wife offered to also pay for the house but I want to keep paying for the house myself) and bought a certified 2017 bmw 750i.
Buying the bmw was not the best financial decision but I apsolutley addore the car. Since I got a new car, I of course sold my old car. It was a 2011 e class, and I was taking pictures of it just when my sister called me and said that the mechanic told her the fix woud cost more than the car is worth. When my sister heard that I was selling my car she somehow got the idea that I'm obligated to give her the car. I woud be completley fine with that if she pad, but my sister being my sister wanted it for free. Now, if the car was 20 years old and worth 800 dollars I woud give it to her, she is my sister after all. But the car is worth around 15 grand. Of course I sold the car, and my sister informed all of extended family about it. I thod that they woud once in their life be racional, as to be expected they failed to act as normal human beings again and started calling me cheap, an awful brother and many other wounderful names. I'm starting to think that I maybe shoud have just given her the car?"
"AITA for telling a girl she's not my usual type | Been talking with a girl from tinder for about a week and a half.  We've met up once, had an awkward first kiss, and have kept in medium contact over the holidays (around 2-3 texts a day).  It's my first time on a dating app since my breakup a few months ago, and I've been having some decent success. However, I don't really know the scene, and since I'm far more used to being in the relationship I always wonder about how I should be conducting myself.

This girl is very cute, but is very much a different ""type"" than I'd normally pursue (which is nerdy, cutesy/innocent, awkward).  She's very sarcastic (which fluctuates between witty and pessimistic), she goes ""out"" far more than I'm used to, and she likes movies but doesn't seem like too much of a nerd.  I don't really know what this would mean for our long term prospects, but honestly I'm just trying to casually date, so that's not at the forefront of my mind.

So, being a straight up kind of guy and feeling like I can share more with her, I said ""you know, you're not my usual 'type' that I commonly pursue but I'm really enjoying this and looking forward to seeing where it goes"".  To which I received silence.

This morning she messaged me to tell me that what I said was ""offensive"" and that I'm basically saying she's not good enough for me.  I'm a pretty sympathetic guy, so I *can* see how she could take this the wrong way and apologized, but damn if there's not another part of my psyche throwing up red flags at this very moment.  Normally (in a relationship) I would just exhaustively talk to my partner to resolve the tension between us, but that's not really an option in the newly dating world.

So, AITA and should make it up to this girl?  "
"AITA for making an obese man pay me cash to take up part of my seat on a long flight? | So this month I was flying across the country on a long 5 hour flight, which I had booked and seats selected for. I specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat — just the aisle and window. 

Well, a very obese man boards and I can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. I assume maybe he bought two hence why he’s even attempting to board. I’m mentally crossing my fingers he’s not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. 

I get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. Well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. I sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. After a minute, I decided to be upfront and tell him:

“Sir, I’m sorry but this situation is not working for me, you’re taking up quite a bit of my seat”. 

He wasn’t rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there’s not nothing he can do — although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. It just wasn’t enough, though. He still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. I’m talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. 

I end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. She instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. She goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren’t any open seats on this flight, so there wasn’t a way to move people so he could have two. This causes a very awkward silence. 

The guy seemed embarrassed and didn’t want to get up. He mentioned how he can’t wait for a later flight. I felt bad for him but I was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight — the comfort I paid for. The flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he’ll need to book another flight. The guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here’s where I made my offer. 

I told the guy, “Look, I’ll put up with this if you give me $150 — that’s half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.”

He instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. He even told me he appreciated it. 

Well the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn’t volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. I just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet. 

From my perspective, I gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and I was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person’s body pressed against you involuntarily). A win-win. He wasn’t angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately. 

After the flight, the couple behind me glared at me but I ignored them. This leads me to beg the question, AITA? "
"AITA for asking my professor to continue with the lecture? | Last night I was in class which is about 3 hours long. In the middle of our lecture he went off on a tangent (he does frequently) about when he used to coach football and then about an experiment him and some friends once did. I do believe he was getting to a point that was relevant to something in the lecture but after 10 minutes of rambling, I raised my hand and asked if this all was relevant and if not if we could continue with the lecture. 

He was very surprised and said no one had ever asked that before (he is 70 years old and has been teaching a long time I presume) so I began wondering if I was out of line. My original thinking was that I was there to learn the material and he was in essence wasting my time and money by talking for so long about irrelevant things. 

He did immediately end the story time and finished the lecture without further tangents. So, was I the asshole here or was it reasonable of me to ask what I did?

Edit: Thank you all for your input and time. The results are pretty mixed so I don’t know if I really got an answer other than some would see this as rude and others wouldn’t. From my teacher’s reaction my guess is he is on the side of not rude but I will talk to him to be sure he didn’t feel slighted and explain to him my reasoning. This may actually help him understand my POV and keep things mostly on topic in the future. Thanks again, Reddit!"
"AITA for not tipping in a state that actually pays its servers? | I live in WA. This state, and a handful of others, [require employers to pay tipped employees the full state minimum wage before tips](https://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped.htm). The way I see it, once you're making minimum wage, it's between you and your employer. I don't tip the kids at Mcdonalds, why would I tip a server who's already making at least minimum wage without my help?"
"AITA for letting my kid drink his soda before I paid for it at the register? | I do a lot of shopping my with my young kids and sometimes when we are shopping we get hungry or thirsty. I will let them sip on a soda or eat some food, that doesn’t need to be weighed, before getting to the register. I used to do this as a kid with my parents and I have never had issues with my own kids. We always pay before we leave and I make sure I clean any mess we made. But today my husband got extremely upset with this, saying that we are stealing from the store and being disrespectful. He and I have both worked in retail before, so the fact that our opinions on this are so far apart surprises me. I stood my ground and caused a huge argument. Am I being an Asshole customer by not paying before I open it?

Edit: For those of you saying I should bring a snack: I think it looks like theft even more when my kid or myself eat something I brought and I stuff the wrapper in my purse or garbage. They don’t know I brought it from home.

Second Edit: I do not always do this. Sometimes when I’m running errands with kids we get hungry or thirsty. Instead of stopping at a restaurant, I buy something at the store. It saves me a stop. If they want something they ask, I don’t always say yes and they usually respect that (they are kids after all).

Also, for people upset that my child had soda: this particular example is of an 11 year old. Soda is not an issue at that age and I won’t change my mind about that. It’s not an every day thing, and everyone deserves treats sometimes."
"AITA for giving some customers priority service in my restaurant? | I own a restaurant and we’re across the street from a lot of medical offices, including a fairly large children’s oncology clinic. 

Whenever a family with a child from the oncology clinic comes into the restaurant I’ve let the servers know their food should be put ahead of all the other orders. 

Those families have usually either had a long, difficult day or are celebrating a major victory, and in any case I don’t want to keep them waiting. 

Recently a customer approached me and said “I  notice what you do with the kids with cancer and their families and it’s a nice thought to do once in a while if they’re clearly in a rush or having a bad day, but I come here every week while my husband is in treatment across the way and I’ve never gotten priority service. Half the time I come here my food gets held up, and I’m a loyal paying customer! I know you have good intentions but it’s really rude to the rest of us.”

Now I’m worried I’ve been an asshole to my other customers or that there’s dissatisfaction brewing and they feel they can’t say anything because of the sensitive nature of the topic. AITA?"
"AITA for saying health issues aren’t an excuse to be fat? | I have a friend who is very overweight, who has another friend who is also very overweight.

We were talking about weight and I expressed the dissatisfaction I’m experiencing after dealing with multiple ongoing health issues over the past few years. My friends friend (let’s call her “Jane”) jumped down my throat about how I could “eat more” and “if you’re fat what am I.” Jane then went on a long rant about how some people can’t help being fat, and how she’s only overweight because of her health issues.

So I said many people have health issues but still figure out ways to take care of themselves. She said she has hypothyroidism, so unlike me she doesn’t have energy to workout.I explained that I too also have hypothyroidism, and that in fact, I don’t even have a thyroid. But that I still manage what I ate even when I can’t go to the gym. 

 I also said that I understand you gain some weight dealing with thyroid issues but not enough to become morbidly obese. That it’s very rare to have a health problem that makes you gain enough weight to be THAT overweight, and hypothyroidism definitely isn’t one of them. At some point people have to acknowledge that some weight gained is their fault and not their disease. She started crying and told me I was fat shaming her, and my friend agreed. 

She’s made a lot of comments in the past about my body, and has implied I have an eating disorder (I don’t, like at all). She always tells people I’m only skinny because I don’t eat. (Also a lie).

My friend is saying I should apologize to Jane but I stand by everything I said she’s been a passive aggressive bitch to me for too long. 

I WILL apologize though if I’m in the wrong, so AITA?"
"AITA for snapping at my girlfriend because she ignored my wishes? | First off I genuinely would like to know the truth here, so don't hold back. I also think I could have handled the situation better but my frustration got the better of me. The situation literally just occurred and she has walked away without it being resolved so I would like some independent views to help me when we resume the conversation later.  

So, I own and operate an independent clothing store where I work full time, and my girlfriend whom I live with, and usually get along with absolutely fine with no major incidents at all, helps me out on Saturdays when the store is busy. 

Today as usual she was in the store and helping with customers, when one of her friends came in with flowers to celebrate the store opening (it's a new business). My girlfriend put the flowers in a pot, and started to rearrange the counter where i serve people so she could put the flowers on show. Now she had already mentioned she didn't like the way things were laid out, but I do and as I am in here every day working and she is not, I feel like I have more of a say in arranging things the way I like them (feel free to disagree with this and tell me why). 

There is a valuable ashtray with significant sentimental value sitting on the counter which I have there because I like the design. However my girlfriend does not. She said she wanted to move the flowers to sit in the place the ashtray is and put the ashtray away because she doesn't like it. I said to her I would prefer not to have the flowers in that specific place as it will totally block my view out of the window of the store, and I like to see the street when I'm working, as I often make eye contact with people walking by and this prompts them to come into the store. She said fine, and I thought that was the end of it. 

However about an hour later, i was leaving the store to pick up lunch for us. As I am in the doorway, I hear a crack and turn around and see that she has gone ahead and rearranged everything anyway, and in the process dropped the ashtray onto the concrete floor. I assume it's broken and in the heat of the moment exclaim ""Fuck *Name of girlfriend*, just leave it alone!"". I then walked out to get us lunch. 

When I came back she was extremely frosty and said I should never under any circumstances shout like that and I am totally in the wrong. I said I understood that and was sorry, but she should understand that I was extremely frustrated as when it happened, i thought she had destroyed this valuable object because she totally ignored my specific wish to not move the flowers, so I was both upset and frustrated at being ignored and thinking my ashtray was broken. 

Her response is that that is irrelevant and I am in the wrong for speaking to her like that. 

So Reddit, am I entirely in the wrong here or as I think, we're both arseholes here?"
"AITA for telling my brother he can’t come to Thanksgiving if he’s high? | Hello. This year the family is having Thanksgiving at my grandmothers house. Most of the family will be making it this year ( around 24 people) which is unusual since everyone is so scattered. This makes my sisters, my mom, and my grandma super happy so they’re going extra hard on the cooking. It’s supposed to be a nice thanksgiving. The problem is my brother. He’s a good guy, but has very annoying habits that would ruin the event. He’s always high. You can tell in his eyes and how he just smells like weed. In the last few years he’s been smoking all the time. I called him yesterday to invite him and his girlfriend. I told him to not smoke and get his shit together for one day. I also told him to tell his gf too. His GF is a total dope. I don’t think she even works. "
"AITA for leaving my girlfriend because she decided to go to grad school? | My girlfriend (now ex) is majoring in elementary education, and wants to be a elementary school teacher.

But, she wants to go to grad school. I calculated it out, and the grad school she wants to go to would put her around 70-80k if not more in debt. 

Now, elementary school teachers do not make much. I feel like this is a horrible financial decision.

So I told her if she goes into that much debt by choosing to go, I’d leave her (we had plans for marriage) 

I did not want to marry someone with that much debt.

AITA? She says she puts education first and that I’m a jackass for saying that she shouldn’t go to grad school, and that elementary school is important etc etc"
"WIBTA: neighbor tells us to keep our dog on a leash while theirs runs around all day | We live on a big lot of land on the lake and we’re always outside, our dog is best friends with our neighbors dog so we’ve always let him out and they play and we’re always outside basically. Well a few months ago, a family moved in next door and they adopted a labradoodle puppy. 

So this new neighbor has 7 kids ranging from 3-18 and my dog (pit/beagle mix fairly small/short) isn’t very sociable, he’s never really been around others beside my family and friends, so he would run over to their house if they were outside and just bark at them. We didn’t know he was doing that up until 2 months ago when the wife sent out a super long group message to our whole neighborhood about how bad our dog was and saying if we don’t keep our dog on a leash she would call the police. 

Well, now that they have their dog, they let him run around to the point he’s on our porch barking at us for HOURS without anyone telling him to stop, he eats our cats food that’s outside, and jumps all over our dog while he’s on a leash. They don’t do ANYTHING to train him or stop him. My parents are nice and don’t mind the dog because he’s playful and the dogs get along, but it aggravates me that our dog is forced to be on a leash or a short runner so that theirs can be outside all day and annoy everyone.

WIBTA if I was to reply in the group message she made to talk badly about my dog, and say they need to either train or keep their dog on a leash despite my parents already telling them they didn’t mind it? They tell me to stay out of it but I’m afraid one day my dog is gonna snap on theirs and they’ll blame it on us and have our dog taken away, even though ours is well trained and on a leash."
"AITA for replacing a picture of my husbands late wife? | Three years ago, my husband lost his wife of 18 years. She passed from a brain tumor, only 11 months passed between her diagnosis and her death. She was only 41 years old and left behind 4 children ranging from the ages of 5-16. 

I have actually known my husband for about 8 years, as we work together. I always found him to be a handsome guy, but never did I start falling for him until a year after his first wife passed. He even introduced me to their kids before we officially started dating. They all accepted me with open arms and have all been nothing short of amazing. 

We got married last November and welcomed our daughter in September. About a month back, we had some family photos done with all 7 of us. They finally arrived in the mail recently and I decided to start framing & hanging them throughout the house. There are 4 photos with my husbands late wife hanging around the house. 3 of them are old family photos and the other is a shot of just her. 

There are only so many places to hang photos in this house, so I decided to move one of the old ‘family’ photos and place our newly done photo there. The old frame was a lot smaller than the new one I had put it, so I moved the old one to a more tight spot in a less visible area of the house.

I soon came to the realization that this may have come off a bit tacky, so I talked to my husband and children about it upon their arrival from work/school. They all said it was no big deal and encouraged me to leave the newly framed photo in this spot, which I did.

Over the weekend, ‘her’ parents came over to visit with the kids. They, especially her mother, have always seemed to have a blatant disdain for me. She discouraged my husband from marrying me because I was ‘too young’ to help raise 4 children . Then, she yelled at me for referring to myself as the kids mother. Despite the tense past, I have never seen her as angry as she was about the changing of pictures. 

She accused me of trying to replace her daughter by giving rid of all evidence that she once lived in the house. I assured her that was not the case. She demanded that I put the original picture back in its place and find another spot to put my photo. I refused, telling her that my husband and her grandchildren had all approved of the way I did things. She then when on a long rant about how I have no respect for her or her husband. I replied by saying that this is my house and I will do things the way I want just as she can arrange the things she wants in her own house. They angrily stormed out of the house and we haven’t heard from them since. 

Perhaps I came off a little too hard, but this woman has been making my life miserable from day one. I had simply had enough and felt that I had to put my foot down and stop letting her get away with the ‘grieving’ excuse."
"AITA for not telling the woman at the bagel place that she smooshed my bagel with her boobs and that I didn't want it anymore? | This happened years ago, but my wife just reminded me of it so I though I would get some random internet strangers to weigh in.  


I was in line at a bagel place ordering my usual sandwich (Onion bagel with jalapeno cream cheese, red peppers, and lox). The woman behind the counter helping me was, to put it bluntly, very large. Large everywhere, especially in the chest area. She spread the cream cheese on my bagel halves, then leaned over to reach the salmon. When she leaned back, the bagel halves had adhered themselves to her shirt. She looked down, cocked her head a bit, and then oreo cookied them off her breasts, set them down and continued making the sandwich. I just stood there in shock. I certainly didn't want to eat the sandwich anymore but I also didn't want to make this woman feel bad about her size because had she been an average sized person, this wouldn't have happened. In fact, it had never happened before or hence and I've probably eaten at this place dozens of times since.   


The lady finished making the sandwich and in that time I decided what to do. I went to the registers, paid for my sandwich, took it outside, threw it in the trash, and drove home hungry.  


My wife, while laughing at me, always says that I'm an asshole for not speaking up because that woman might have continued smooshing sandwiches until an actual mean person yelled at her for being too fat. From my perspective, I just didn't have it in me that morning to make a person redo a sandwich and make them feel bad for being larger.   


So, Am I the Asshole for not speaking up?"
"AITA for expecting a reason when told ""no""? | My(41) wife (39) has a habit of saying ""no"" to things without reason or explanation. While I completely understand that in many scenarios this is all that should need be given, but in the cases I'm referring to I feel not giving one is rude/frustrating. One example from today for example..my wife complains about her poor sleep constantly, is always tired, needing to nap during the day, etc. I suggested we get her a fit-bit so we could track her sleep, and perhaps get some insight. Her reply to this was ""no"". When I when I asked her what her reasons for not wanting one, she just said that ""no"" was a ""complete answer"". I told her I just wanted to understand her reasoning for not wanting one, and she went into a ""I'm not having a stupid conversation with you"" rant and left it at that. Am I the asshole for looking for a reason and thinking a little expansion more than a ""no"" is an appropriate request?"
"AITA for not shutting my kids up? | This is from a while ago, but I always wondered if my husband and I were in the wrong about this particular situation. 

Last year we were renting one side of a duplex, the other side was lived in by the owner of the duplex. At some point, she had a friend of hers move in, rent free. Now, I have 2 small children, and at the time they were 2 years old and 5 months old, so babies. 

This woman ended up getting a job working at mcdonalds, usually the night shift, so she would be sleeping at weird hours of the day and night. My husband was a stay at home dad, and because of the weird daylight hours where I live (AK) my kids sleep schedule was pretty messed up. 

So one night, about 8:30 - 9 this woman bangs on my back door that was connected to the laundry room, telling me that we need  to calm my 2 year old down(the running around was vibrating their side of the house). Ok, thats fairly reasonable so we said sure, well try to keep them from stomping around. Apart from a stomp here and there, the kids were quiet. No crying from the little one or anything

A few days later on a Saturday at 11 in the morning, this lady does the same thing. ""You need to stop him from running around so I can sleep"". I straight up told her to fuck off, and that I wasn't willing to sit him front of the tv for however long she needed to sleep for. Its 11 in the freaking morning, and winter in AK. So he really had nowhere else to get his energy out, and I wasn't comfortable with him watching hours and hours of tv. She threw a fit, talking about how we needed to be respectful of her hours, and how she would tell my landlord, who would evict us. I laughed in her face and told her that I very highly doubted she would even be mad at us, and that I would not silence my kids at the place I pay to be, at a normal time of day. I didn't even attempt to quiet them down.

She did this a couple more times, all between 11am and 4pm and I told her I would only keep them quiet during the times I was required by law to not be invasive (10 PM to 7AM I think)

Later I found out this was really messing with her sleep, and she was eventually fired for either not being responsive at work or showing up late because she was sleeping. 

So, were my hubby and I the assholes?"
"WIBTA if I were to continue drinking Lapsang Souchong Tea despite my roommate's disgust at its aroma? | I've gotten interested in trying different kinds of tea lately, one of them being Lapsang Souchong, which is a form of black tea that has been smoked over pinewood prior to packaging.

I enjoy the flavor and aroma of it and I like to drink it every once in a while. My roommate, on the other hand, thinks it smells like ""Burning erasers"" and has complained about the smell the last couple of times I've been drinking it.

Would I be the asshole if I were to continue drinking it when there is a possibility of him entering the room, or should I try to stick to other kinds of Tea?

.

Edit: Thanks for the advice. Since Spring is around the corner, I'll try opening a window when I want to drink Lapsang tea and I'll do whatever I can do make sure that I only drink it while my roommate is in class and not in the room, which tends to trap smells due to the cramped nature of dorm halls. I might also look into lidded cups, but my teapot already has a lid on it."
"AITA for telling a friend I won't come to her bachelorette party because I'm not a bridesmaid | Melissa (33F) and I (32F) have been close friends since we were 18/19 year old college freshmen. We met at our dorm and moved in together in sophomore year. We lived together in the dorm for two years before getting an apartment off campus together, and after graduation we moved together to a new city and lived together there for a few more years, until she moved in with her boyfriend.

We wound up moving to different parts of the country but stayed close, text daily, and visit often.

I got married last year and didn't want anyone to have to travel for my wedding, so we had a small ceremony with only our parents and a couple local friends. I didn't have a wedding party. We later had a reception at my home town which Melissa flew in for.

When Melissa and her boyfriend got engaged last year, she asked if I'd like to be in the wedding party, and I said ""of course!"" Recently, I learned that she'd chosen a wedding party, and I wasn't in it. I was pretty surprised by this and asked Melissa what was up, and she answered that she had to make hard choices but she needed people who were local to her. I get that. It hurt my feelings a little, but I understand the practical reasons.

Melissa's wedding is in December, and my spouse and I are planning to fly in for the wedding. Ahead of that, Melissa invited me to visit this summer so we could go see a favorite musical together when it does a limited run in her city. So I'm currently planning to fly over to see her twice this year.

Yesterday, she texted me to ask if I could also fly to see her in November for a ""bachelorette weekend"".

I'm financially comfortable, but that's a *lot* of travel, days off work, and so on to see this one person in a city I've already been to many times before. I love to travel, but I want to go *new* places! Of course, if I were in the bridal party, I would make this work and go to the bachelorette party, but since she didn't include me as a bridesmaid, I feel like there's no reason for me to put extra effort into this.

In my response, I demurred at first by telling her I'd check my schedule but might not be able to make it work out, but she pressed me further, saying she ""really wants me there"". Because we try to be honest with each other (and we'd discussed the wedding party issue before), I told her outright, ""It would be one thing if I were a bridesmaid, but I think it's a bit much for you to ask me to travel out to see you three times this year when I'm not even in the wedding party.""

She left me on read for about an hour, then responded, ""I thought you were over that."" We haven't spoken since.

AITA?

ETA: since a couple people have already mentioned I should have said that was too much travel - ""telling her I'd check my schedule but might not be able to make it work out"" included telling her that I have other trips this year already and would be running low on time off/travel funds. It was only after she pressed me to come anyway that I brought up the bridal party issue.

ETA 2: I'm the asshole for bringing up the bridesmaid thing again. Thanks, guys! I'll talk that over with my therapist before trying to talk to Melissa about it again. Obviously there's a lot more going on in my head than just whether I get to carry a bouquet for two minutes or not, and I need to resolve some deeper shit."
"AITA for revving my engine at a woman? | Redditors, this literally just happened. 

I just pulled into the parking lot at work and I’m driving down the aisle and come up behind a van parked in the middle of the aisle. This isn’t uncommon as people wait for their spouses or whatever to come out. Usually they move to the side or just circle around. Well this woman was blocking the whole aisle and wasn’t moving. For the rest of this story you need to know I have an exhaust on my car that makes it crackle and pop at certain engine loads. So I give the throttle a blip, no response. Another slightly louder blip, no response. She then gets out of her car and walks around the front to the other side where she proceeds to pull her phone out and take a picture of he side of the building. During this she sees me sitting there and does that little wave/sorry face. She then proceeds to take a couple pictures and examine them. Meanwhile I have the throttle held about halfway down so I’m making noise. 

Satisfied she goes to get back in her car and gives me another little wave. Once in her car she proceeds to sit there and I can see her plugging phone in or messing with something so I start flooring the throttle causing lots of noise and big backfires. She gets out and asks me what my problem is to which I respond “Get out of the way. There are two empty parking spots right next to you. You’re taking up the whole aisle!” She flips me off and gets back in her car and drives away. I park and start typing this. 

For the record whether I am the asshole or not I feel no remorse for this. But Reddit I ask you, AITA?

Edit1; for those saying I should’ve just honked. I feel a honk is more aggressive than a throttle blip. So at first I was just saying “hey there’s someone behind you” but yes, at a certain point honking might’ve been more effective."
"WIBTA if I drop out of being a bridesmaid 2 weeks before the wedding? | I [F29] am a bridesmaid in my friend’s [F30] wedding. We’ve been friends since high school.

I spent the day at her place, helping her with put together wedding favors along with some other friends. She and her friend went out shopping, while the rest of us continued to work. While they were gone, one of the BMs was texting the BM group about the day of requests. BM asked if we were comfortable wearing fake lashes. I said no, because I have a lot of eye problems and I’m hesitant to introduce foreign substances near my eyes. Eyeliner doesn’t bother me, but mascara can sometimes be irritating so I only wear it for special occasions.

When the bride came back from shopping, she stormed in and immediately said “Do you even want to be a bridesmaid?” I was shocked that she was so angry. It’s not like I just don’t want to wear fake lashes because I’m picky. I was more concerned about irritating my already sensitive eyes. In my shock, I replied no and reiterated my medical concerns.

Then she went on to yell at me for other (untrue) things in the past which she never mentioned before (which is unlike her...she usually speaks her mind). She stopped yelling and left the room. I immediately burst into tears and went home.

Later in the night, she texted me and asked if I was okay and she didn’t care about the fake lashes, but was shocked that I so easily said I didn’t want to be a bridesmaid.

I sent her a long text the next day saying that I understood that she was stressed, but explained how hurt I was by her words. I also brought up the points she made about me while providing explanations to the ones that were not true. She ignored all of my concerns and replied only with “so you don’t want to be a bridesmaid anymore?” I responded that it would be inconsiderate if I dropped out now, but if she wants me out, I understand.

Later, I found out that she texted my mom to tell her she’ll no longer be using our house for the rehearsal lunch since “we’re not on good terms”

It’s been a day and she hasn’t responded. I’ve been so upset that I’ve been physically sick. I don’t care about the fake lashes. I’m upset that she was so willing to drop me as a bridesmaid so easily and refused to listen to my side. I’m tired of waiting to see if she’ll keep me as a BM. I’m tempted to just finalize the dropout and say I’m not going to even come to the wedding or help out at the venue (therefore killing the friendship which is a first for me)

TL,DR: My friend got upset that I didn’t want to wear fake lashes due to medical concerns, and asked if I still wanted to be a BM. I was shocked at her hostile tone, so I reacted and said no. She began to yell at me about other things she was upset about me (but never brought up before) and didn’t listen when I tried to reason with her. I’m tempted to drop out of the wedding completely due to stress and disappointment."
"AITA I told my husband and my kids that we could get a dog but then I changed my mind | Our 11 y/o dog died this past July. We got her as a puppy and she was the first dog that really belonged to either of us. She was a smart girl, had a strong personality, and she was mighty cute. My husband took it really hard. He fell into a depression for weeks. I was distraught and felt guilty for being the one holding her in my arms as she was put to sleep (my husband waited outside with our kids). In the last two weeks my husband has been pushing hard for us to get a new dog. He feels ready. He forwards me links for adoption organizations and pictures of all kinds of dogs. They're all cute of course. I told him I wasn't ready, feeling that no one could replace our girl and worried about the responsibility of training a new dog. I'm a stay-at-home-mom and would be with our new pet most of the day. 

2019 has been a crap year for us with a car crash, several health emergencies, and the loss of our pet, so despite my reservations I went along with some adoption agency visits because I saw how excited and happy it was making him to look at potential pets. This past weekend we were at an adoption event at a local pet store and we found a beautiful dog. Everyone got excited about her, but all I felt was anxiety. I said no. I thought about it all week and opened up my heart to the idea of this dog in our lives so I told my husband and kids that we could get her. We called yesterday and she had already been adopted. Immediately, my husband went into search mode again and flooded my inbox and phone with texts and pictures. I told him I wasn't ready to keep looking again and that while I had imagined the dog we met in our lives, I didn't want to just get any dog and wanted to hold off our search. He's upset with me and we argue because he goes from agreeing to wait, to telling me about a litter he found out about on craigslist. He's almost desperate about it and I feel as if I crushed his heart. My kids are more ambivalent,  but they really want a new dog too.

I feel like the A for going to see dogs despite not feeling ready and for agreeing to adopt one dog but not wanting to continue the search for another."
"AITA for sacking the nanny? | Hello everyone!

Here's my story:
I have two sons, the older is 8, the younger is 7. I used to be a single mom for years. I found a great nanny 5 years ago, who helped me out a great deal ever since. She looked after them on weekends, picked them up from school, took care of them during holidays etc.
We became somewhat friends over the years, and she insisted taking the kids all the time. 
I tried to stay within reasonable limits and pay her as agreed, even though she never wanted to accept my money. Obviously, I insisted.

I usually had this feeling that she is overly friendly with me because I'm a stable source of income, but I hushed these feelings away as she truly handled the kids well and they loved going there.

Fastforward a couple of years. I'm about to get married now to a great guy who has been living with us for two years. He works from home so bringing the kids to the nanny once a week was more for keeping our routine and not pressuring my fiancée into watching my kids. We are planning kid no. 3 and thought it would be handy to keep the nanny for the future as well.

The problem started yesterday. We came back from a 5 day trip with my SO and picked the boys up from her place. I asked them how everything went and they (mostly the little one) told me that they don't want to go anymore because the nanny's husband gets upset often and he is scary. They said that he hits them and his own kids when they don't behave well in the car, and later precised that he never actually hit them, just threatened them. I should also mention that my kids have rich imagination and they do indeed tell white lies.
I figured it's best to go to the nanny with the kids to clear things out, knowing that she is veeeeery easily offended. I warned the kids to only tell the truth and to express their feelings to her, so it doesn't come from me.
In the end, she raised her voice and got really upset with my little one, saying that her husband is upset sometimes but he would never hurt anyone (I believe her), and that my youngest plays the baby to manipulate me. I understood that the whole thing was overreacted, but since the little one cried histerically today and yesterday as well, and he made me promise that he would not have to return to her place, I asked for her advice.
I told her that I believe her, but I cannot ignore my son's emotions and I would feel like a terrible motjer if I forced him to stay with her. I asked if she has any advice for me. 
At this stage she pulled her pokerface and told me that she was deeply disappointed that I side my 7 year-old instead of a grown woman and she made up her mind not to have anything to do with me or my children ever again.
I apologized but stood my ground and left. I made the kids say thank you and had them realize how much she has done for them/us over the years. She didn't bat an eye.

Any advice/opinion would be greatly appreciated "
"AITA for asking for sympathy over stomach flu when he's immunocompromised and might have been exposed to it? | A friend (I'll call them T) and I live together in a flat. My boyfriend was staying over and got sick. Thought it was a hangover, but later it became clear it was very bad stomach flu (or similar), and was too late to move him. Later that day, I mentioned to T that he was ill. T told me that some of his disabilities make him immunocompromised (which I hadn't known beforehand) and that he'd like if we left the flat.

I deep cleaned and we left the next morning, as soon as bf could move. I apologised and assured T I had done what I could to minimise the risk. A lot of the things T said implied that he felt a sort of blame for me bringing sickness into the flat.

I later got in contact, asked how he was doing and said that I had come down with the same flu and was now very ill (for context, this is the day before a big piece of coursework was due, which he knew). He responded, ""I'm not sick yet"" and a 21 item list of things, asking if I'd cleaned them (ie, ""laundered hand towels in bathroom and kitchen"", ""front door inside lock knob"", ""soap dispenser pumps"", ""tiles behind kitchen sink"", etc).

I responded with the things I had done. I then mentioned that I was ""mildly saddened"" that he hadn't asked how I was doing, but that I understood he was at risk and needed to prioritise himself. I said it just would have been nice to get a ""hope you're doing okay"". Tried to show my issue was really minor. (Edit: have commented below on the controlling behaviour of his that led me to speak up at this point).

He responded with ""This is inappropriate and has fucked me off so I'm going to calm down and reply another time"". I left it for the night, and responded the next day, saying that he didn't have to read my message immediately if he needed space, but that I was upset with his reaction. That he was totally valid in his concerns for his health, that I wanted to support him, that my initial upset was really mild and didn't deserve the anger. I emphasised that I wasn't upset with his health concerns and tried to be respectful and honest.

He said that he was ""so fucking tired of \[my\] supercilious behaviour"", that he ""wasn't fucking around with social niceties"", that I have ""no perspective"" and am ""riding a moral high horse"". I think his issue was that he thought I was minimising the severity of the risk. Or that my issue was with how concerned he was for his health. Perhaps that I was asking for sympathy when his concerns are currently much greater. AITA?

&#x200B;

TL;DR My immunocompromised flatmate was concerned for his health after my bf got terrible stomach flu, I didn't know he was immunocompromised before this but deep cleaned and left so he wouldn't catch it. I got ill, said I was a bit sad about lack of sympathy, and he got very angry. AITA?"
"AITA for speaking Korean with my boyfriend in front of my roommate | So I’m half Korean and I’m mostly fluent with an accent but can’t write. My boyfriend is natively Korean and speaks Korean much better than English.

He moved in with me last month(with my roommates agreement) and we talk mostly in Korean because he’s much better at it. Today my roommate asked us not to speak Korean in the living room because it feels like it’s “isolating” her from the conversation. I said no because that’s basically saying we can’t talk in the living room because we talk in Korean most of the time, I don’t want to have to make a conscious switch because one of us wants to watch tv.

She then got mad and said it feels like she can’t ever go into the living room because we’re having conversations there. I said she can go wherever and it doesn’t matter, but she still wants us to stop. I don’t want to, my boyfriend thinks we should just use English and then move to our own place when the lease is up(and hopefully the world has calmed down a bit).

AITA?"
"AITA for being annoyed with my cat? | ...or is my cat the asshole?


His name is PJ (Patrick Jr., after my husband) but mainly we call him Pidgey. He’s always been a real 10 of a guy; a real cat to brag about. He greets me at the door when I get home from work every day, he is always down for a cuddle and he doesn’t seem to know that his claws and teeth could be used for violence against humans. Seriously, you could pick him up and toss him around and he’d just meow at you. Not that I would ever do that. He’s my precious Pidgey.


But, in other news, fuck Pidgey. Because as much as I really do love him, he sucks. I understand that cats can develop territories, and lately Pidgey has adopted the upstairs bathroom and hallway. However, this seems to apply only between the hours of 5- 7AM.


Every weekday morning it’s the same: my alarm goes off and I sneak out of my lovely warm bed. Already, Pidgey is on the other side of the door meowing like it’s his job to wake me up or I’ll sleep forever. And no, before you even suggest it, he’s not hungry. The first thing I do is go downstairs and feed him; he ignores the food completely and runs right back upstairs to bother me in the bathroom.


You know those tear-jerking videos of dogs greeting their owners after long absences? It’s like that, every morning, only it’s 5:30 AM and I’m fucking tired and trying to get ready. I cannot deal with him every single morning. He puts out his paw in this cute little pantomime of “pet me pet me!” and I just do not have it in me. Don’t get me wrong, I pet the shit out of the little bastard, but it’s never enough. I get in the shower, he sticks his head through the curtain and meows at me. I get out, soaking wet, and he covers my wet legs in cat hair before I can dry off. I brush my teeth and he jumps up on the sink and bumps my hand. Cat hair everywhere, and no amount of petting settles him down.


The rest of the day, he’s a normal chill cat. He’s upstairs right now, being chill. If I go up there, he’ll come over and say hi, but where’s all the intensity? Right now I’m sitting downstairs on the couch with a perfectly good open lap and two hands that could be used for petting (if I weren’t currently shit-talking him online), but no. It has to be the only time of day when I’m on a time constraint and otherwise unable to give him the attention he demands.


I could shut the bathroom door, of course. But such a good boy deserves my love, doesn’t he? He’s a good boy. Every time I growl “enough!” and rudely toss him off the bathroom sink, I feel like an asshole. He seems to have gotten it into his head that this is the only time of day he can receive love, and he goes after it with the intensity of a drowning man. It seems so sad to deny him. Should I just accept the fact that this is his love language and set my alarm earlier to make time for Pidgey? Or is he a fucking asshole who needs to fucking chill?

Edit: said kitchen, meant bathroom

Edit 2: as this post has gotten more replies I realize some vital information is missing. So, for clarity’s sake and to maintain the integrity of voting:

A) Pidgey is a Tonkinese boy, which is very similar to a Siamese, which explains the temperament.

B) Pidgey has a sister, Molly. She’s no star in the personality department like he is, but she keeps him company when we’re not around.

C) We recently had a baby who takes up a lot of our attention. This is most likely the root cause of his actions. He is still very much loved. This is not a case of “if you don’t have time for a pet, you shouldn’t have a pet!” He’s just used to being King Boi around these parts."
"AITA for playing loud music to silence my annoying-ass neighbour's kids? | So this is a problem that's been going on for four years or so and gets worse every year as the kids age. Currently the oldest looks to be about twelve and the youngest about six.

So my next-to-next-door neighbour's kids never shut up. They have a trampoline in the back garden and every day you can count on them waking up early and jumping and screaming well into the night. And the worst part is the screams - it sounds like they're all being operated on without anaesthetic. It's worst at summer but happens year-round. I wouldn't mind if it was occasional - hell, I'd encourage it - kids will be kids, but it's the persistence that gets to me.

I have a pretty big speaker system (A 2004 Panasonic SA-AK520 to be exact) which I've decided to start facing out the window and playing *Death Grips* as loud as possible. It gets the kids to shut up and I turn the speakers off once they do so. Is this an asshole move or am I in the right for making noise back, especially when it's exam season and I need the quiet to revise.

"AITA for enforcing my boss's ""decency rules"" while at a conference in Vegas (even though he seems to have thrown them out the window)? | Using a throwaway since this is work related. Basically we are in Vegas this week for a conference. Our company owner has basically blown the budget and put us all up at in individual rooms at one of the nicer, newer and ""hipper"" casino resorts. It's been an awesome time. I've worked for the company for 6 years (I'm 28 and female, this might be relevant later) and this is the first time I've ever seen him do something this extravagant. 

Ordinarily he's a nice married, very quiet guy who makes sure we are all out the door at 5:30 and doesn't bother us in our off time. 
We had an office ""huddle"" before we left and he sort of went over his ""expectations of behavior and decency"" and how we were to represent the company while in Vegas. He was clear that our off time was our off time but while on the clock we were to be dressed in appropriate clothes, away from the gambling and day clubs and meeting with clients. Totally fair enough as far as I was concerned. 

Yesterday I was taking break in my room between client meetings. Our company has two college grad hires who I really like. They are also stunningly gorgeous girls and they are each staying in a room to the side of me. I came out to the hall and they were out there at 2pm wearing literal dental floss bikinis. I asked where they were going and they said the pool club. I asked them if the realized there was client meetings this afternoon. They said that a client was paying for them to be at the club. I was like wow...so I told them they had to change as I didn't really care if this was at the club, it was totally inappropriate to meet a client wearing a thong bikini. I genuinely like both girls and think they are smart and capable salespeople but both gave me this look like I was an awful stick in the mud and like I was the mean house mom but they relented and changed into casual business attire. 

I ran into my boss later that afternoon at another meeting and he asked me point blank ""why'd you make an ass of yourself to Katy* and Kate*?"" He's never spoken to me like that in 8 years so it really took me by surprise. I asked him if this was about the bikinis. He said ""you don't think a potential 3 million dollar client knows what he's paying for when he asks our two youngest sales girls to show up in bikinis?"" I reminded him of what he said before we left about keeping decent during the day and he said that after 8 years I should know enough to be flexible and give a high dollar client what he's asking for in order to close a sale. It was the first time in 8 years he's ever spoken to me like that. In full disclosure, I don't think they minded and they were just excited about getting into a club to dance and party while ""working"" (I probably wouldn't have minded either when I was 22). 

But the whole thing just feels gross to me. But he is the boss so was I the asshole for enforcing the rules he laid down even though he seems to have changed his mind?"
"AITA for shoulder-checking a lady at the subway station? | So, I'm on the train getting ready to get off as it pulls up to my station. A lady (not extremely young or elderly, but maybe 40s) walks up ready to get on.

For the uninformed, common courtesy is to let current passengers off prior to getting on yourself. Of course, there's always an asshole here and there that doesn't give a fuck.

Lady decides she wants to be that person. We actually meet eyes as the doors are about to open. Doors open and she's literally walking straight ahead into the group (me and maybe 2 others) getting off.

I realized this, tightened up a bit and instead of swerving or sidestepping her, I literally lean into it and shoulder-check her. She didn't fall or anything but she probably knows I purposely bumped her, says something out loud but couldn't catch it fully as I had some headphones on.

In my head, it's totally like ""fuck that bitch"" but I realize that I kinda picked on her for no reason seeing how I never really shoulder-check other idiots who rush the doors.

AITA?"
"WIBTA if I told an employee they could no longer go on a work trip to Europe since they are moving jobs 2 weeks after the trip? | I know this sounds like one of those ""obviously NTA"" posts but i have gotten a surprisingly mixed bag of responses from friends/family on this. 

An employee of mine, lets call her Sam, has been with my team for about 9 months. She is very open about her disdain for her role and work. In early August Sam and i are going to Paris for meetings about the program Sam helps run and I oversee. Our company is paying for our trip and airfare will be covered if we stay for vacation after the meetings. (Ex Im spending a week after in Germany on my dime, company pays for airfare)

Sam also has planned on taking advantage of free airfare to Europe and has a vacation planned for before the meetings start. 

Today Sam let me know she was moving jobs and her last day would be mid august. (I know its a long transition time but its pretty standard in our company)

I am not surprised she is leaving and frankly not that upset but  will say that i am about 99% sure if we don't pay for the airfare, she will have to cancel her vacation plan. 

WIBTA if i told her she wasnt invited to the europe meetings and effectively ruined her summer vacation plans?

EDIT: A big part of this is budgetary. We have limited travel budget and freeing up the 3-4 grand would help"

"WIBTA if I gave my classmate a taste of his own medicine, and made fun of his appearance? | I’m in a college class with a really arrogant, neck-beardy type of guy who is really overweight, has a greasy, unattractive piggy looking face, and dresses like shit. Unfortunately he is in the same program as me so I see him a lot. He is that dude who is always interrupting the professor with comments and questions that are thinly disguised flexes. He once smugly went on a long rant about how “string theory is the most beautiful thing in the world” in a US history class. Eye roll. 

He comes up to me and tells me that the class project I presented last semester was just unbelievably awful and goes on and on about how much it sucked, how stupid I am, and how he doesn’t know how I got into my university, this sacred, hallowed institution of pretentious pricks who perpetually have their head up their own asses.

My view in life is that people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. What the hell kind of nerve does this dude have, going up to an acquaintance and telling them their project from last semester sucked? Sure, I procrastinated on it and it did kinda suck, but I never asked his opinion nor is he an instructor or grader.

"WIBTA if I told my uncle that I have reasons to believe my aunt is cheating on him? | I'd like to first say that I'm close with both my uncle and aunt. My main concern is that I know I could completely destroy their family (they have one son) if I mention my aunt's behaviour but here's the context.

So recently my aunt and uncle have been arguing more as my uncle suspects that my aunt has been unfaithful in some way. They never argue in front of our family but my aunt told me in private that at some point he flipped out while drunk and asked to see her phone because he thought she was texting someone she was having an affair with. She cried to me about the situation saying that how he was being was unfair. She then said something alone the lines of ""When you get accused of doing something like this by your partner, it makes you want to do it"". At the time I thought nothing of it.

Me and my aunt work in the same company which means I see her literally every day of the week. It also means that it's unlikely she can hide something from me because we literally sit in the same room. One day I glance over at her and I see the weirdest thing:

A burner phone.

The minute she caught me glance she tried to slide it under the folder on her desk. I turned away so that she wouldn't know that I had seen it but automatically alarm bells started ringing.

On another day I walked past her while she was using the phone I caught glimpses of texts to someone saying things like ""I love you"" and ""things are good on my end"". 

I've never picked up the phone myself but I know she leaves it at work and never takes it home. I know this because we go home at the same time and take the same route. However yesterday she told me she wouldn't be coming back with me cause she's going out. I asked her where she was off too in a light hearted way and she wouldn't say anything. Normally she's the type of person that would say where she's going and with who. She then messaged my uncle and told him she was going out with ""the girls"" from work. Sounds pretty reasonable right? Except all ""the girls"" had either gone home or stayed behind to do extra work.


WIBTA if I said anything to my uncle? Should I check the phone myself first to see if maybe it's all innocent and I'm blowing things out of proportion? Any advice is appreciated. Also sorry for any grammar/spelling issues I'm dyslexic. Thanks.

TLDR: Caught my aunt using a burner phone and sending affectionate messages to someone after my uncle has accused her of cheating even though she says she's innocent. Should I say anything?"
"AITA for leaving my girlfriend and twins because I didn't and don't want to be a father? | I've been seeing Kelly (names changed) for two years. She became pregnant very early on and gave birth to twin girls. I was adamant in not wanting children and she expressed similar ideas. We mutually agreed on a plan in case of accidental pregnancy but she didn't follow through when the time came. I'm not going to mince words about pro-choice or whatever: it was her decision and while I gave input, it was completely up to her.

Kelly decided to bring the twins to term and I would at least attempt to be a father. They're six months old now and I don't think this is the kind of life for me. I was vocal to Kelly about my thoughts and feelings and while she was upset, she relented it's a life I never wanted and she wouldn't stop me from leaving. It would be amicable.

I don't want to be a deadbeat dad, though. I'm speaking to a lawyer now about organizing a lump sum child support payment which will cover 25 years (the law here is 18 years plus 4 for college if necessary, the additional 3 is extra). Whether or not they use that extra 4 years for college is up to them. I'm paying more out of choice, not legality. Spousal support isn't on the table because it depends on coliving (we didn't), marriage (we didn't). At every point in the child support calculation, we've considered the high end for my income to benefit Kelly and our children the most. We're talking normally I'd be on the hook for $350,000\~ when I'm putting forward $530,000\~.

I know parenting isn't about money but it's all I can really do. Maybe in the future I'll change my mind and rejoin their lives if they'll let me, but this isn't the path I want for my life, at least not now.

Am I the asshole here? What can I do to not be the asshole?

edit: for some extra context and to quickfire get out some facts: I travel 40-50 times a year to remote places like Russia, Bermuda, Hong Kong, Australia, 20-30 times a year to the US. I'm in Canada. I am maybe home 20 days a year. I make high six figures and my girlfriend makes high five figures. Regarding rejoining their lives, it would only be if every party consents and terms are agreeable. If they don't want me involved in 10 years, I won't push it. I'd like to be a part of their lives, I just need to focus on work right now. I could retire in 5-10 years and be set for life as well as my children set for life. I just don't want to be a father *now*. I'm 26, she's 25. She used the patch and we used condoms about 50% of the time. The children are indeed mine as confirmed by third-party testing. If I were to rejoin their lives, I wouldn't ask for the child support back."

Well, it turns out her mother has access to it through her daughters phone.

Many people were happy to see the update, and it got a lot of positive attention.  However, now it's constant posts about everything: weather, religion, random quotes from random people, going to see plays, memes, etc.  She's basically using it as her own personal facebook page.

she then proceeded to explain to me how we shouldn't let some family members cook certain food because of some instances where they fucked up and ruined the dish (this is all completely false information that she is mentioning to try and start some more family drama)

"AITA for not giving up a 17 yr friendship with an ex because it suddenly makes my husband uncomfortable? | Throwaway for reasons

17 yrs ago I (39f) started going to a new local bar with friends. I quickly became friends with the owner (51m). We just clicked. It was great. Over a year later in early '05 we started dating. I openly admit I loved him deeply. It ended the last week of '07 because I found out he cheated. I was devastated. I went full no contact for almost a year. Once I got over it I realized I missed the friendship we had so I reached out. He felt the same. We became closer than we ever were. It has been 100% plantonic since then. The only thing that might be considered inappropriate is he calls be Bea. Its shortened from beautiful. He has called me that since I've known him. Thats it.

In 2011 when I was diagnosed with cancer. He went to chemo with me. In 2013 when his Mother and sister tragically died in a car accident I held his hand as he gave the eulogy. This is how close we are. Through all.of this it was never anything more than friendship. 

In 2015 I met my husband (39m).Around the same time best friend opened a 2nd location of his bar so we didnt see each other much. Husband met bestfriend at his bar. Saw him multiple other times too. Never had a issue. I was 100% transparent about the fact that we dated. Still no issue. I had kids and was tied up. We rarely saw each other but talked almost daily. 

Husband and I have 2 kids (3f 1m) and I adopted his daughter from his 1st marrisge (7f). Husband is a improve productivity consultant and is out of town frequently. I'm a SAHM.

Recently bestfriend hired someone to handle day to day of his bars so he could concentrate on the in vitro him and his gf (52f)  of 3 yrs were trying. It was successful. He's beyond excited. He's been reaching out more to me because I have kids. Advice, opinions etc. Multiple times a day. 

Last week bestfriend invited me to a impromptu lunch. Hadn't seen him in almost a year. I happily got the kids ready and went. Husband FLIPPED THE FUCK OUT.  It was disrespectful and inappropriate to go without him. He was ok with friendship from afar but since we talk more now it makes him uncomfortable that I'm prioritizing a man I use to sleep with and I should back off and cut him out.

I'm shocked. In 5 years he has never hinted that it bothered him. They get along great. Laugh and joke. I refused. Fuck that. You dont get to pick my friends. Its been 17 YEARS.  Before this lunch issue husband has never shown controlling or even odd behaviors. We've had such a great relationship. This came out of left field 

AITA?

TLDR: my husband of 4 yrs, together 5 suddenly hates my best friend of 17 yrs who I dated over a decade ago because we had lunch without him. Wants me to cut him out. I refuse

ETA:
I left this in a comment below and am adding it here too. 

Hol-ee crap this blew up overnight. I'm struggling to keep up.  I figured this was the easiest way to update/comment so everyone could see. 

The bea thing- my husband has known all along what it is from. He asked why does he call you B and I was honest. 

Bestfriend started reaching out more, not me. I respond when I can. 3 kids keep me busy. We dont call really, haven't for years. Its texting. 

I am very much in love with my husband. I love our life. 

Finally all the notifications prompted my husband to ask wtf was up with my phone. I showed him this. He's less than thrilled I put our business online but it prompted us to agree to discuss it tonight after the kids go to bed. Neither of us want our marriage to end. Reading all the yta comments made me see it from others pov. I want to work this out."
"WIBTA if I don’t let my sister do a charity run with me. | This is more controversial then it first sounds. Please let me know. I would like to know and make the best possible decision. Throwaway and on mobile.


Two years ago, as a teenager, I was diagnosed with cancer. I have seen children from the age of 10 days old sick, wish for death, cry out in pain and die. It’s shit. 

That’s why I made a vow to help out with as many charities as possible, when I beat this  illness. 

My little sister has also (obviously) been impacted by her big sibling waste away before her eyes and scream out whenever she was in pain that she wanted to die, and actually mean it. 

One thing about my little sister is she always copies me. I join a drama group, she joins the same drama group. 

I learn an instrument, she learns an instrument. 

I cook some cupcakes, she cooks a cake, which tastes better.

I draw a picture, she draws a self portrait.

I make some friends, she becomes friends with my friends. 

She always ends up one upping me as well. She got a better part then me in the play, she is better then me at music, and my (ex)friends like her more. (I heard them. That’s why they aren’t my friends anymore.)

She even came out as gay before I could. (I’m bi) 

I gained a lot of weight on treatment, and recently, I have been working out and have gone on a diet. I have lost 2lbs and am preparing to do a charity ‘mud run’ next year. (I will be ready by then). 

I said this to my parents at dinner and my little sister said ‘ I’ll do it too.’ 

I have spent months planning and have been training and trying to make myself a fitter person to be able to do this.

I want his to be something, just I can do. So I can have something I can say ‘I have done this, all by myself’. But, if She does this with me, she will get more money and it could be seen as selfish. 

When I said this to her, she called me selfish, and said I can’t stop her. She told me she could get more money to find cures for cancer and we might save more lives sooner if she does this. And I guess, after all, that the whole point of charity runs is to bring people together, but I really don’t want to do it with her. 

So, WIBTA if I don’t let her do a charity run with me. And am I over reacting?

Edit: I wrote this post in a moment of rage. And whilst I was seeing red, I forgot a piece of information. I know I published this less then an hours ago, but since then, I she’s been debating where to put it in or not, as I don’t want it seem like ‘ you are trying to get us to say NTA,’ when, in actual fact, I forgot about it. I’m outing it in anyway. Shortly after I was diagnosed, my little sister did a charity run for a different cause (physical therapy for a classmate who couldn’t afford it) with the rest of her class. She raised £50. I think that may be part of the reason I am/was apprehensive to let her do it with, she has done it before.

Another edit: I realised now that I was a bit of a dick. Well, a lot. I’m currently making it up to her and hope our relationship as sister and brother can continue. I shouldn’t feel angry or jealous about her coming out, I should be happy that she has the courage to do it before I can, and I shouldn’t be resentful of her achievements, because, I would want her to be happy when I achieve them. I am sincerely sorry for seeing red and acting out in this way and I hope I can become a better person, as I have learnt this lesson. I’m sorry, and thank you all for the input."
"AITA for failing an intern? | In April, a family friend's daughter, Sarah, contacted me about doing an internship. Sarah's family is in the same business as I am, but she needed an in-family internship. I've had her work for me before, so I said yes immediately. She's a great kid and a great worker. She needed 150 hours, and we hashed out pay, I signed her internship agreement and we were on our way to a great summer. Before she started, I asked her if she was interested in a summer job (full time May to August) or if she just wanted to do her internship and be done. She indicated she would like the full time position, so I didn't hire any additional summer help.

Everything was great for the first three weeks, then she started to become unavailable due to family obligations- helping a cousin with a cross country move, a sibling's surgery- I didn't say anything because I do think a cross country road trip in college is more of an experience than working in my shop for a week. 

Except I found out that Sarah was lying about all of these things she needed to do. The last straw was when her sister called me angrily and asked if Sarah was working for me. We found out that Sarah had been telling her family that she needed to help me, and telling me she needed to help her family. I left her a voicemail telling her the hours I needed and to let me know if she was interested and did not hear back. That was about a month ago- she had approximately 40 of her 150 hours completed. 

That was about a month ago, and I didn't think any more of it, until I saw Sarah's dad at an industry event. He awkwardly asked in front of other business owners if I could still sign off on Sarah's internship. I told him I would, not wanting to make a scene. 

I connected with Sarah again, and told her I'd sign her paperwork if she could work about 10 more hours that I was desperately trying to fill. She informed me that it wasn't just a paper, it was an entire report and visit with her advisors. I told her then that I was going to need her to do more of her hours before I would meet with her advisor. She agreed. 

She did the first 10 hours, and I've contacted her to schedule more hours and she is ghosting me again. Am I the asshole if I send her her last paycheck for the 10 hours and then refuse to meet with her advisor and tell her school she's satisfactory completed an internship that she hasn't even worked half the required hours?"
"AITA - Room sharing | So I got married in May. Each of us have a child from a previous relationship, both are teenagers. Both have mental health issues. We have a modest two bedroom apartment. Wife and I share the small room, the kids share the master bedroom which is fairly big.

My daughter is very extroverted. Hers is introverted. There have been some conflicts, but nothing major, mostly space and privacy issues, ""her stuff is on my side"", that kind of thing. But her daughter is very insistent that she have her own room. Mine doesn't seem to care that much. 

Wife has brought it up numerous times, but after reviewing our options, I always say no. Because the only alternative would be for wife and I to give up our room and convert the living room to a sleeping area for us. To me this has serious ramifications for us, as now *we* have no space for ourselves. I personally think its a terrible idea because now we can't have people over if we want in a common space and it seems like we are squatting in the place we pay the bills for. 

So while I am empathetic about everyone's needs, I still really can't do it. Has become a point of contention as her daughter keeps coming to her with strife. Wife is depressed.  I feel we have gone to great lengths to make her daughter feel like she has privacy, even buying her a canopy bed with blackout curtains.

I also work from home and the area of the main room is also my office. I can't sleep 3 feet from where I work.

My take... Basically accept that this is what we have to work with because we can't afford to move. And work out your issues.

What do you think? AITA?"
"AITA for feeding my children meat and other non-vegan foods behind their vegan mom's back | Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I'm a parent of three children. The oldest two are 8 years old and the youngest is 5.  Their mom, let's call her Jess for convenience (obviously not her real name). Jess often goes on various fads about certain things then quits them in like a month. 

The most extreme one is climate change. She'd be absolutely into it for like a month. Basically on that month she would stop buying plastic, start going to protests, install solar-panels and she even went to our savings account and purchased an electric car. Next month she would completely quit, start buying plastic and ultimately stop bothering anymore.

This happened multiple times with different things every time, so the family is pretty much used to it. One day she read some stuff on the internet, watched a few videos and randomly decided to become vegan. She started cooking only vegan meals. Me and the kids weren't exactly fans of those meals as we were avid meat-eaters.

Now it was okay for me because I could eat meat outside the house. She knows that I do and she doesn't try to change me because she knows how hard-headed I am. But the kids only eat home-cooked meals so it was way worse for them. Nevertheless, we were patient because we knew she will quit it within a month. However, it seems that this time is different because it's been three months and she's still just as obsessed as the first day. I figured it's a prolonged fad this time, and we'd wait it out.

The kids have voiced their opinions many times about not wanting to go vegan. Their mom didn't budge, though. So when the mom was at work, I would take them with me to eat whatever meats and dairy they liked. They've had vegan ice-cream and didn't like it at all, so I started to take them once a week to have ice-cream. I told them it's our little secret. 

Regardless, something happened two days ago that fueled my frustration and anger even more. One of the 8 year olds had informed me that their mom showed them animal abuse videos. The animal butchering videos a vegan would show someone to convince them to become vegan, basically. Apparently she also told them not to tell me. 

I've gotten into a huge argument with her yesterday over it and I made sure she wouldn't take her anger out on the kid who told me. She started sobbing and saying it's for the best; that the kids needed to learn this by an early age and not harm animals like she did her whole life. I felt sympathetic with her but told her that it's not a good thing to enforce your beliefs on kids, and to educate them and let them decide by themselves; which she already did.

I'm planning on telling her that I've been taking the kids to eat meat and dairy when the time is right, because I don't like hiding things from my wife. Although I'd only tell her once her vegan craze begins to fade. AITA?"
"AITA for cancelling my wedding because fiancee almost got my dog killed? | Me (28M) and fiancee (27F) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. I also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.

On Saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. I stayed with my parents but I left the dog with her because she likes having him there. However, *I made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.

5am on Sunday I get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. She was drunk, so I told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. When I got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. Two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. I felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.

But then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. The girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.

When we got home, I told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. I told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and I'll tell mine. She was shocked, but she took her things and left.

2 hours later, I get bombarded by messages on Messenger, Whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that I am insane to do this to her after 4 years. They started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.

The logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. Nope. They all fucking agree. My mom said: ""Well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!"" Lucky me, eh? My dog didn't fucking die!

My sister was appalled that I cancelled the wedding ""over *that*?!"" and even my best man said I might have overreacted. Yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. But I am so disgusted at my fiancee that I can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. She isn't fucking 17, she is 27!

By the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. She likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar DANGEROUS things. It's not something I hold against her in the sense that I would ever mention in a fight, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. For example, my dog.

I'm 99% sure I will stand by my decision. But am I really an asshole? Literally nobody is on my side and I have no idea what to think.

&#x200B;

**Edit: Posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. She is negligent and irresponsible and I don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. I'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. If she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, I would also leave her. I guess I realized I don't want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**"
"META just because someone is allowed to and entitled to do something doesn't automatically mean they're not assholes. | I've been seeing a lot of comments on posts following this general thought, ""NTA, it's yours and you're allowed to do whatever you feel like doing with it."" And while sometimes this can be true, most of the time it can really not. Let's take a moment to go over what it means to be an ""Asshole"", being an asshole is either breaking a social norm deliberately in a way that hurts other people just for your own personal gain. So let's say a person was listening to music out loud in the subway and get told to stop yet goes on because he doesn't like the feeling of wearing headphones, he is immediately classified as an asshole. But when lets say a brother completely flames a bunch of kids for taking shit about his little bro, he NTA. I would like to say while he has a really good reason, two wrongs don't make a right, and no matter how much I want to say he wasn't doing exactly what they did, I can't."
"AITA for wanting to cancel anniversary plans with my wife? | So my wife and I are coming up on our four year anniversary and I wanted to try and do something different and special this year to celebrate it.  So last year when I saw a Broadway musical was coming to town on our anniversary weekend, I snagged up some really good seats and paid about $200 for them thinking it would be a cool experience that neither of us have never really done before and also sort of count as a present for us both.   I did all the legwork and made some reservations at a nice restaurant, got the parents to agree to come to town to watch the kids, and even took off work that day since it was my weekend to work.  I had everything set to go but when I finally told her about the tickets the other night, she gave me a weird look and told me she doesn’t even like the theater and couldn’t figure out why I thought she would want to go.  After some back and forth explaining my thought process and that I just thought it was something out of the ordinary and special we could do, she basically told me while she is grateful, she doesn’t want to go to the show even though everything is all set up and the tickets are non-refundable (attempts to sell them have been unsuccessful too for what it’s worth).  Whether I should or shouldn’t be, I feel hurt by how she basically just shit on everything I had planned (with nothing else planned on her part that I’m aware about) and now we are about to flush $200 down the drain just because she doesn’t want to go.  It feels the total opposite of grateful even though she still apparently does want to go out an eat and even suggested inviting some friends along with us.  This is what really has me thrown off; I feel like this is our anniversary and should be just us but instead feels like a red flag and seeing as we are still squabbling about it, I’m turned off to even wanting to celebrate our anniversary now cause it feels like she doesn’t want to spend it with me.  AITA for being pissed at her about this?  WIBTA if I told my wife I just wanted to cancel the entire night?"
"AITA? My wife won’t meet my friend because she says he abandoned me when I had cancer and I think she should forgive him because I have. | Throwaway just in case.

All this started as a small discussion with my wife and it has morphed into an actual argument.  

About 4 years ago and only a few months into dating my now-wife Diana, I was diagnosed with a pretty advanced cancer. It came as a huge shock to everyone, but Diana never left my side since. She went to all my doctor's appointments, sat with me through 3 months of chemo and took care of me after my 2 major surgeries.

So the day I was diagnosed, I was also admitted to the hospital and then rushed into surgery the next morning. It all happened so quickly. When I had a second, I sent out a text to my closest friends telling them I was in the hospital, the doctors confirmed it was cancer, but that everything was going to be OK. I said I had just had surgery, so I couldn't leave the room to call them, but they could call Diana if they wanted to check in or else text me. Plus I didn't wanna disturb the other guy sharing my room.

One of my best buddies I will call Chris never responded to my text. He actually hasn’t spoken to me or texted me since - completely ghosted me. I tried a few times to call/text, but he never responded. It was very out of the blue for me since Chris and I had been part of the same group of friends for nearly 15 years. At least we knew he was OK though because a mutual friend would occasionally see him.

So fast forward 4 years and I heard from the mutual friend that Chris wants to hang out with the group again but he’s worried it will be awkward since so much time has passed. I assured the mutual friend that it would be great to see Chris and catch up and I want him to meet my wife.

Well Diana says she won’t go and she doesn’t want to meet “the asshole who abandoned his friend when he needed him the most”. I tried to explain to her that Chris was going through a tough time when I got sick and it was not personal. And full disclosure… during a particularly rough week of chemo I had a breakdown and I shared with Diana that I was very hurt by the way Chris stopped talking to me. So now 4 years later, Diana says I can see him all I want, but she refuses to meet him because Chris ghosted me a few years ago and has never said he was sorry or tried to reach out himself. Doesn't help that Chris was the only person to react that way. 

Except none of that bothers me anymore and I am cool to just pretend nothing ever happened and move on. I don’t want to push Diana, but I think she is being childish about it. Am I the asshole for wanting her to get over this? She has never actually met the guy. We fight about it every time I bring it up. I say life is too short to hold grudges and she says life is too short to waste your time with people who have proven themselves to be bad friends."
"AITA for refusing to let my 5 year old son to travel to Nigeria with his father? | My ex and I have a 5 year old son together. My ex is Nigerian. I am not. We were only together for 2 years and split up soon after we had our son. He has since gotten married (to another Nigerian). He is a decent father and has partial custody. Since he lives an hour away and our son is in school, he gets our son every weekend and in summer we split half and half.

&#x200B;

I recently found out that my ex is planning a trip to Nigeria during the summer for his cousin's wedding. He said he's planning on bringing our son so he can meet his family in Nigeria. He started planning without checking with me since in his words ""it during his time with him anyway"" I was not okay with this at all. The US travel advisory for Nigeria says to Reconsider Travel and it's a high risk  area for terrorism and crime. I don't feel comfortable with my 5 year old son travelling there. When I told him this he laughed and said I was being silly and only Northern Nigeria is dangerous and the wedding is nowhere near any part with terrorism.

&#x200B;

I held my foot down and said I would never let my son go there. Personally if I wouldn't feel comfortable travelling to a place I would never let my 5 year old son go there. But my ex is being stubborn and now he's calling me all sorts of names to his family and friends and that I'm trying to ""white wash"" our son. I literally had his mom call me and talk to me and try to convince me. My ex threatened to take him anyway and I am strongly considering getting the courts involved.

AITA here?"
"WIBTA if I emailed HR to make sure a work event would accommodate my dietary restrictions? | On mobile. 

I’m fairly new to my job and have tons of dietary restrictions (vegetarian, gluten free, oral allergy syndrome aka no raw fruits or veg). My first day in training for this job they surprised everyone with free food for lunch and it was all sandwiches so I had to go buy my own lunch. I felt really almost ashamed by this and told HR about it and they essentially said “oh we didn’t think about dietary restrictions, that’s something we’ll take into consideration for next time. Sorry”. 
We’re currently signing up for a mandatory work training where breakfast is provided. They don’t mention what is served nor do they ask for dietary restrictions. Navigating my extreme dietary restrictions (gf and OAS) are fairly new to me and many people don’t get it or don’t think about it. And I feel like an extreme nuisance asking for people to accommodate, but I feel like I deserve to feel welcome and have some food at a mandatory work event where food is provided to everyone. 
WIBTA if I email HR back and ask if they could accommodate my extremely specific dietary need? Or is it more polite I to just bring my own food?

EDIT: thanks for your thoughts guys! I’m really new to these dietary restrictions so I don’t know what to expect when it comes to things like this. I emailed them and asked what they will be serving as I was curious due to dietary restrictions and would like to plan accordingly. She just replied with the menu and didn’t offer to accommodate or ask what my restrictions are Hahahahah. so, I’m bringing my own food!"
"AITA For thinking I have a right to my mother's wedding dress? | My mom, as she's getting on in years, has been going through her things and giving a lot of them away. Years and years ago, I expressed an interest in using her wedding dress as my own one day (I have a love of all things vintage), so I just assumed that when the time came (if she felt ready to part with it) she'd be willing to pass down her dress to me (her eldest daughter).

To be clear, I do have a younger sister. And I would be happy to share the dress with her, but we have different fathers and the only wedding dress my mother has is the one she wore when she married my father. Her second marriage (to my sister's father) wasn't a church wedding, and she didn't wear a dress for it. So naturally I assumed, since I'm the eldest, the dress was worn for the marriage that conceived me, and I've been in a stable relationship longer than my younger sister, that my mother would pass her wedding dress down to me when she was ready, or that when I made plans to get married she would offer it to me then.

Instead she gave it to my little sister. My sister refuses to let me have it (I'd really prefer it be kept in my own home; she's not a clean person and has A LOT of animals in her house, and also smokes) and she lied to my family saying that I was going to cut the dress up to use -- something I'd never do, which anyone who knows me would know.

My mother refuses to address the situation with my sister, despite my requests that the dress either be returned to her or given to me.

I get that maybe my sister wishes our mother had worn a dress to the wedding with her father, and if I wasn't so furious about the lack of consideration for my feelings in this at all I would be happy to share it with her, but I really feel like she's being incredibly conceited, thinking that she should be sole person to wear a dress in a wedding that didn't even result in her birth.

AITA here?

&#x200B;

EDIT: To be clear, I understand that my mom's dress is her own and that I'm not entitled to it. If she wasn't freely giving it away without reservation I wouldn't even have discussed it with her. It just seems a little unfair that the dress she wore to a wedding with my father be given to my younger sister exclusively and not at least be offered to me to wear as well.

I guess the part I'm struggling with the most is that, if the situation were reversed, I would definitely not feel like I had the right to own/wear a dress that my mother wore to her wedding with my sister's father, and I certainly wouldn't feel like I should exclusively be able to wear that dress and not let my sister wear it at all. I'm baffled that she thinks the reverse (in our present situation) is acceptable.

&#x200B;

SECOND EDIT: Thank you for your input, this has really helped me clarify my understanding of the situation. I do want to say, that I don't feel entitled to my mother's dress (it's hers, it's her choice, etc.), rather that what I think I was trying to articulate (badly, my apologies) was that I felt it was unfair that my sister be given the dress when it had more meaning to me and I have more of a connection to it. As I've said, I would never take ownership of a dress our mother wore in a wedding with my sister's father, and it feels selfish/cruel of her to do the reverse to me.

I don't feel this is down to bad communication, as I told my mother years ago that if she ever wished to give her dress away I would love to wear it. She was aware of my feelings in the matter and she and my sister both chose to disregard them. Nothing I can do about that.

My mother and I haven't always had a good relationship, wearing her wedding dress would be very special to me on my wedding day, but as many of you have suggested this is likely something that I will simply have to let go.

As a last ditch attempt I have had one final conversation with my mother over this. She told me she gave the dress to my sister because she ""wanted it"" and that my sister doesn't intend to wear it, specifically citing that my sister wanted a ""$15,000 Vera Wang type of dress"" for her wedding instead. My sister hasn't responded to attempts to discuss the dress. So, at this point, it looks like no one will wear it.

Thank you again for all your comments.

"AITA for wearing a hoodie with profanities on it out? | Throwaway.

So I [21F] have a ripndip hoodie that says "" fuck you you fucking fuck"" on it. My older sister gave me the hoodie a few months ago for my birthday. It's a pretty warm and comfortable hoodie & I like it a lot, problem is I don't get to wear it often since I'm a college student & for obvious reasons I would prefer not to wear it to class.

This morning I noticed I was low on toilet paper so I went to the store in sweats & my ripndip hoodie & as I was at self checkout a family stopped me & started lecturing me about my hoodie & how it was offensive & shit & I just walked past them & ignored it, as my back was turned the mom I'm assuming call me an asshole. Obviously that mom's a hypocrite on how she handled it but AITA here for wearing that hoodie out in public?"
"AITA for asking my husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours? | We live in a studio apartment which means pretty much no alone time when both are home. I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.

He moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.

This Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.

Regarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.

EDIT: Thank you all for the comments, discussion and different perspectives! I definitely phrased it wrong: I would never kick him out. We had a really good talk today and understood each other's sides much better. He actually felt like I didn't want to see him and I was able to explain that that is not the case at all, I just needed some time without other people around (which I can't get outside). 
He understands that which is why we have a great marriage and will definitely make it through this ;)"
"AITA for telling a mom with tree kids that I'm not moving tables so she and her kids have extra space? | I was at out local coffee shop today, and it wasnt too busy. How the store is set up, is that there is this really nice corner table that has a really good view of the lake and  waterfall; it is also has the largest space between it and table in front of it. I had already settled there, and was enoying my latte and was getting my watercolor set up ready to paint, when this woman came in with two kids and a baby. I really didnt think anything of it untill after she ordered and started moving towards me. When she got to me the conversation basically went like this: 

The Mom: Hey, can I have your seat? I need the extra space for my kids stroller

Me: Sorry, but I got here first and I want to paint the waterfall

The Mom: Well cant you just paint over there (pointing to the corner where I couldnt really see the waterfall at the angle I wanted to paint) 

Me: Sorry m'am 

cue to her lecturing me about not being curtious because she has three kids and needs the space more than I do, and me telling her that's not my problem and putting my headphones in to paint.

AITA for not giving up my space to her and her kids in a coffee shop that doesnt really have the space?"
"AITA for letting my pregnant sister sleep on the sofa? | My (16M) sister Daisy, recently visited.

She was spending the week to help out with a family problem.

My sister is 7months pregnant.

When  she arrives my mother asked me to give up my bedroom.

Daisy is clearly surprised and said she thought the sleeping arrangements had been sorted otherwise she wouldve asked.

"AITA for not inviting my best friend to my bachelorette? | I've known my best friend Lisa since middle school and we attended one year of college together before I transferred. We stayed super close through all four years of college though because my new school was in the same city. We've had what feels like thousands sleepovers, dinner dates, movie nights and heart-to-hearts that have cemented our bond as each other's oldest friends.

But for how close we are, we have always hung out one-on-one because she gets SUPER weird around my other friends. With just me, she’s normal and fun and a mostly mellow girl with a big laugh that I love. She doesn’t drink and has anxiety but that doesn’t stop her from meeting new people and being chatted up by strangers all the time because she's very fashionable and has a unique/interesting career. Generally, she's just a cool and normal girl.

But with my other groups of friends, specifically in nighttime settings, she acts VERY weird and is a lock to ruin the vibe. She’ll get quiet and when asked getting-to-know-you questions, she’ll mumble her response or answer while looking only at me (wtf?). She'll make awkward jokes that border on being rude and laugh REALLY loudly over random things that no one else finds funny. For example, at one of my birthday celebrations at a beach house, she wouldn't talk to anyone but me, declined to partake in playing volleyball, and when one of my friends bopped the ball into the window of the AirBnB and cracked it, Lisa laughed SO loudly for about five minutes straight. I knew my friends were miffed because while we were all kind of stressed and trying to evaluate the damage, there Lisa was, sitting by herself laughing nonstop. 

She’ll also isolate one word or phrase from someone’s story that sounds funny to her (and just her) and laugh about that forever. This is stuff she doesn't do one-on-one!! And lastly, because she doesn’t drink, she is not the kind of friend you can leave unattended over the course of the night.

So long story short, I didn’t invite her to my 12-person bachelorette. I did invite some girls I don't know as well and she was devastated. She said that I’m her oldest friend and that she had always looked forward to being with me during all the milestones of my life. She also said I am prioritizing having a ""good drinking crew"" over our 16 years of friendship, which did hit me hard.

But I just want to have a fun bachelorette where I'm not constantly watching out for her and stressing about whether she is happy, or if she is offending anyone by being standoffish and ignoring their attempts to make conversation.

Some of my friends have said that this is harsh and they’d be heartbroken to be left out of such a big event. But I personally have no intentions of changing my mind because shitty as it sounds, I’ve been through this before, and I know group activities are just more fun without her there.

AITA?"
"AITA for seeing a student who is a grown ass man? | My colleagues and I disagree on the following issue:

About 6 months ago, I started seeing someone. That someone happens to be a student (22M, Jack). I happen to be a professor (27M) at the same faculty. I am not Jack's professor. We didn't meet at the school. He is the student of one of my friends at another department (Prof. Mark). I do not talk to Prof. Mark about Jack. Jack doesn't talk to me about Prof. Mark. We barely even talk about school.

I think I am doing nothing wrong. We like each other, he's an adult, and we don't come into contact at school at all. For the sake of clarity, let's imagine this is all happening at a Faculty of Arts and Humanities, where I work at the department of Spanish Language and Literature, and Jack is a student at the department of Philosophy and History. The Faculty consists of 5 buildings which means we've never seen each other at school. We still don't see each other there even though we're a couple.

My colleagues think it's unethical to date him and that he might be trying to get to Prof. Mark through me. Apparently, his grades in Prof. Mark's class aren't that great, so my colleagues think he will try to use me to get on Prof. Mark's good side. If he tried to do that, I'd leave him immediately, but in the past 6 months he's done nothing to imply that might be his end-goal. I didn't even know Prof. Mark was his professor until I mentioned to my colleagues that I was seeing someone who is a student at Prof. Mark's department.

So I'm currently being accused of being unethical, a bad friend, dumb and an asshole.

I think their lack of belief that somebody could possibly date me because they like me, and not because they want to use me, is a bit offensive. And I think calling it unethical is offensive because we have literally nothing to do with each other in the academic sense and our relationship would have no impact on his success. (Unless Prof. Mark decides to punish him.)

AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Our faculty handbook says it's against the policy to date students who are minors and those we have direct power over, in the sense of teaching or supervising. Teaching and supervising in other departments never happens, so there is 0% chance me and Jack will ever come in contact at the school."
"AITA for allowing my children to ride an Uber home from school alone? | So, am I a bad parent for allowing my children (9f & 12f) to ride an Uber home from school instead of picking them up myself? I am a self employed working mother.  I spend approximately 2 hours of my day driving my kids to and from school. The school is only 10 minutes from home. But because of lack of parking and the general chaos at school at pick up time, I spend an hour at each time I pickup or drop off. 

In the past I have always been able to find other parents to carpool with. My children attend a small private school and finding other parents in our neighborhood to carpool with can be difficult. This year I was not able to find another family to carpool with. So, I’ve been looking into other options. 

The best solution I could come up with to arrange for an Uber to pick my children up from school. In the country where we live, children are permitted to ride alone in an Uber. I made arrangements with the teachers aide in my daughter’s class to help them find the Uber once it arrived. After the first 2 days, my daughter’s were able to find the Uber themselves and ride home. I ordered the Uber and could watch the route as they drove home. I work from home and am there to greet them when they arrived. 

Everything was going well until yesterday when one the teachers at the school found out that my children were ubering home everyday. Today I got a call from the principal, basically shaming me for my choice to allow my children to ride home unaccompanied. He stated, “I can’t believe I have to make a policy for this. Don’t you realize it’s unsafe for your kids to ride in an Uber alone? Because of you’re actions, I’m going to send out an email to all parents prohibiting them from allowing children to ride in taxis or uber to and from school alone”.

I don’t agree with his suggestion that Uber is unsafe compared with other transportation options. Children at age 9 are allowed to walk home from school (this is what most parents at our school do. But we live on the other side of a busy highway and it’s not possible to walk). The school offers busing. But at $2,500/yr/child, it’s not affordable for us. Plus with the amount of bullying that goes on in the buses, I don’t see how that is a better option.  Another option is to hire someone to pickup my girls from school. I’ve done this in the past and will likely do it again now. But it is always a hassle when they are late or call off sick. One of the reasons I like Uber is because I know the drivers are insured and have a clean criminal record."
"AITA for not giving my daughter money for school lunch? | My daughter is 12, and just started her last year of middle school. Already even though she's only been in school for a week and a half, we're having an issue that we had last year as well.

I prepare all of my daughter's lunches, or I will prep several ingredients for things and she can sort of assemble her own lunch. They're healthy, nutritious, and never made up of things she doesn't like. But towards the end of last year and now she has been basically throwing a fit once a week about how she's tired of having her own lunch and she wants to buy lunch. I looked into the school's lunch program, and while it's not as good as a homemade meal, her school has many lunch programs you can sign your kid up for including one that is pretty dang diverse and healthy. I told her I was fine with signing her up for the lunch program if she'd like.

Nope. She wants to have some extra money so she can buy junk and she claims that there is a huge culture of trading food and no one wants hers and she feels left out when everyone else has pizza. The school has little separate kiosks for junk food that are open at various points in the week, and I know if I gave her money for the whole week, she'd just eat that stuff or get candy from the school shop. I told her if she wants a little extra money she can do some more around the house, then use that for pizza or something once or twice a week, but that if she does that \*we probably won't go out as a family for fast food on the weekends (not that we do much now already). She'd still be free to eat whatever snacks she buys, go out to eat with friends (which I usually pay for so she doesn't spend her own money to be social), etc. No go.

She gets money for grade improvements or anytime she learns a new skill, and she also has a ""snack allowance"" if she goes to the store with her mother or me, where basically in exchange for being useful at the grocery store, she has a set amount of money out of the grocery budget for the week just for snacks for herself. We do ""tax"" unhealthy snacks a bit more so she doesn't blow it all on candy or something. Point is, she COULD use her own money though I still wouldn't allow it daily.

I also asked my older child who went to the same middle school and was there with her for his last year and her first if he's ever noticed any bullying of her about this stuff. I don't trust him to be observant enough to know if she's being bullied, but he said no one cares what other people are eating and he doesn't know of anyone getting bullied for snacks. He also mentioned that when he was there, if she had a problem with someone, she came to him and she never mentioned anything about snacks. Of course, that was only the first year, and she started complaining the second year so who knows.

\*It's also worth noting that my daughter does not LIKE fast food for the most part, and so this is very socially motivated for her and not food motivated for her. Since she is younger than her peers, we are careful to not indulge in peer pressure requests too freely as she is VERY susceptible to it and this is the primary issue, not what specifically she is eating (though yes, I do not want her eating fast food for lunch every day and don't think she's old enough to have total reign there).

Her mother disagrees with me and is worried I'm going to give her an eating disorder, but I feel like if the only eating disorder I give my kid is one where she know how to make healthy, nutritious meals, then I'm fine with that. Even if she pushes back and eats unhealthily in college or something, at least she'll have good habits and the know how to get it back if she needs. AITA?

**Edit:** a lot of focus on the ""tax"" at the grocery store. First, it's not an actual tax, which is why I put it in quotation marks. It's more like, we say ""you can get approximately $X worth of snacks while we're here, but if it's only candy/processed food, then you can only spend ($X-$5) or whatever. Or if she comes back with only a a tub of ice cream, a giant bag of candy and a giant bag of chips, we might tell her to put one back and not eat it all in one sitting, and next time we go shopping, just grab her some healthier stuff we know she likes. We don't even give her any money in these scenarios, nor make it an exact amount she can spend and certainly don't make her count it back to us or take the money back as an actual tax. Most times we don't even bring it up since we she usually gets a good mixture of snacks with a treat or two."
"AITA for being annoyed my girlfriend has started dressing ""weird"" recently? | My girlfriend always dressed comfortably and practically until recently; she works at a professional job, and she would usually wear jeans, sneakers, T shirts or sweaters, etc.

About a month ago, she had her friend shave both sides of her head, but leave hair on the top and back of her head. I wasn't a huge fan of it but she said she wanted it for a while, but she was too afraid of being embarrassed if it turned out badly. But now that everyone is working from home, nobody can go out, she took the chance and she loves it.

Then she bleached her brown hair to blonde. Then in a week she dyed it florescent green.

And she was buying a lot of new clothes, crop tops and tank tops, really loud patterned pants, platform sneakers that look like running shoes but have a sole that's like 3 inches tall? Just generally flashy and eccentric stuff. And whenever I ask, she says that this is more her style but she's just been more comfortable getting into it when there's less social pressure.

She's stopped wearing bras and that's also awkward because I can tell she gets stares

I asked what she's going to do when she has to go back to work, and she said she'd dress appropriately but obviously couldn't change her hair. But she didn't think that would be a problem, she'd been practically indespensable during the difficult time the company was having recently, and she couldn't see there being any trouble over hair.

I've said I also don't love her new look, and she's always like ""I don't look that different, like it's still me"" but honestly she does look really different.

We had a fight after I asked her a couple times to just wear normal things when we hang out together, and she got really upset with me over it, saying that she was just trying to have some fun and try something different and it was really rude of me to tell her how to dress

AITA for being annoyed with my girlfriend's change in style?"
"AITA over being upset at my gf for judging my family? | Myself (28m) and my gf Haley (23f) have been together for 2 years, live together, and have an amazing relationship. However, we come from very different families. Her family is pretty traditional, everyone marries, settles down, then has kids. (not to say she firmly believes this is the ""right"" thing to do, though. She had a pretty fucked up childhood, if that's at all relevant). My family is extremely blended, with many divorces and teen pregnancies and kids with various partners. Haley has always gotten along really well with my family, they love her and vice versa. She has always accepted the way my family is, but something happened this morning to make me think otherwise.

My cousin Jared (23m) and his girlfriend Amy (22f) just had a baby boy September 2019. I should also add that his younger sister, my cousin Shania (21f), has 2 boys with two different guys. My girlfriend loves these kids dearly and spoils them. So when Jared called this morning to tell me that he and gf are having another baby, I was surprised when Haley responded with a stone face and said nothing. I asked her why she didn't seem happy for them and she said: ""Jared still owes your grandma thousands of dollars right?"". I said yeah. ""And Amy is still waitressing? And smoking?"" (they both smoke cigarettes) I said yeah. She just said K and continued making breakfast. I asked her what that was supposed to mean. She got really agitated all of a sudden and snapped back with ""I'm sorry, I love your family but sometimes their stupid fucking decisions get under my skin. I just hate seeing kids keep having have kids"" then went on to bring up other things about my family having lots of dogs and not training them properly and swearing in front of the kids and how none of my cousins have proper jobs to support their kids and dump them off with grandma all the time and live in trailers. She had NEVER expressed any of this before and I was shocked; it made it seem like she sees my family as inferior and trailer trash.

I've been reflecting on the things she said and yeah, they are true. I guess I've always just seen my family as normal because I'm the son of a teen mom myself. She approached me a couple hours later and said sorry, and that she just really believes that people shouldn't take having babies lightly because her parents had major unsolved issues throughout her childhood, which stick with her to this day. I accepted her apology, but I still feel hurt and bitter about what she said about my family. AITA?

UPDATE: 

To answer a couple questions: Amy did smoke throughout her pregnancy. Haley has been in therapy for her own traumas for a couple of years now.

So Haley and I had another talk, and we feel as though the situation is resolved. Btw, she does not know about this post. A lot of you guys really hit the nail on the head. On her side of our convo, Haley said she doesn't look down upon my family (and honestly, she's just not that kind of person), she just gets frustrated sometimes watching the kids have to grow up in environments that are not ideal for them. She's emotionally attached to my family (and really, really loves the dogs, haha), and the reason she got so heated was because she cares. Something she said verbatim was ""it's not like I've been carrying around this giant resentment for them, I love them, today it just hit too hard"".

On my end, I now understand where she's coming from. You guys helped bring me a lot more clarity on that. I guess I was in denial about my family, and I feel like I was being a bit of an ignorant baby about the situation. Quarantine is making me a little weird, man. Just because they're my family and I love them doesn't mean I have to celebrate and turn a blind eye their poor decisions. I've realized it also doesn't mean that she was attacking them by expressing her issue with their decisions. Special shout-out to u/conditionalinterest \- thank you for your time and caring response. Your comment is very important. 

And to the people calling my girlfriend privileged, you have no clue what that girl has been through in her short life. I'm lucky to have my strong, feisty, intelligent, caring woman :) Thanks everyone!!"
"AITA for un-inviting my date to my school's dance because her dress was too revealing? | I go to a private Catholic all-boys school, but I also hang out with a lot of kids from other schools. One of the people I hang out with is this girl Emmy, who I have an 'on-again-off-again' thing with. We've dated on and off for the past year, and although we aren't at the current time, I don't really like anyone else, so I asked her to our 'Fall Formal' dance (basically homecoming lol). 

&#x200B;

She accepted, and everything was fine for a while. However, a problem emerged recently with her dress. Basically, my school is really big on dress codes at school dances, and there have multiple times in the past where people have been kicked out or just plain refused entry due to 'dressing badly'. Emmy's dress falls into that category: really low-cut v-neck, tight, and ends way above the knees. I had mentioned to her previously about the dress code rules before she bought the dress, but she shrugged it off/ignored me. After some back and forth, she refused to return the dress and get a new one, so I told her I was 'un-inviting' her as my date. I just think it's not worth all the trouble to be refused entry or get kicked out. It would make a scene and be generally embarrassing. Besides, I'm seen as basically a 'good, clean kid': good grades in AP classes, lacrosse and soccer teams, student government, speech and debate. And I'd hate teachers to see me as some sort of troublemaker, especially since they'll be the ones writing my recs for college.

&#x200B;

Anyways, she got pissed and went off about how it's 'her right' to wear whatever dress she wanted and called me a 'dick' and told me I had to go with her, because now she had bought a dress and it was too close to homecoming to find another date. I think she's entitled to wear whatever, but I'm also entitled to invite or not invite her.

"AITA for not wanting to be neighbors with a Pit Bull? | My fiancé and I will be living in a split level property owned by his parents. We’ll be living in the top part. The people below us have been living there for a number of years already. My mother in law came to me and asked if we would be interested in getting a dog when we move in. We would be interested but we’re unsure of the timing as we both work long hours. She then brought up that our neighbors had expressed interest in getting a pit puppy. She wanted to know how comfortable we’d be with living above one, and perhaps dogsitting/walking it if they ever had to go somewhere. I immediately said we would not be comfortable with that living situation. Before everyone immediately goes for the YTA button please let me explain. I know that there are plenty of Pits who are good amazing dogs. I’ve even met some. I believe it CAN depend on the owner but up to a point. I notice one big glaring pattern when it comes to Pit attacks though. The owners always always say, “ They have never done this before!” “It was out of the blue!” “They would never hurt anyone before!” I understand these dogs don’t have a good reputation, but they don’t have a good reputation for a reason. And for the Chihuahua argument that will come up, I’d rather be bit by a Chihuahua than a Pit any day of the week.

My mother in law understood and would let them know that that they should maybe look at different breeds. My fiancé did agree with everything I said, but when I mentioned it to a friend of mine, even though she agreed, she thought it was assholish because she didn’t think it was fair that as a neighbor we kinda control what dogs are allowed. I get that, but if I don’t feel safe with simply checking the mail everyday, I’d rather not live there. Plus most apartments have breed restrictions for insurance purposes, so I don’t see how that’s different? AITA for not wanting to be neighbors with a Pit?"
"AITA for not paying for someone else's art supplies my kid ruined? | This happened in early March, but the situation is still going on.

I have a 5 year old daughter, who we'll call Emma (not her real name). We live in a neighbourhood full of families with young children, so it's not unusual for kids from different families to play together with 1 or 2 parents supervising. I'm also occasionally the supervising parent, so it's not like I just expect other people to watch my kid.


Early in March, Emma was playing over at another 5 year old girl's house with the other kid's mom (let's call the mom Lina) supervising. Lina later told me that her nephew was also visiting at the time, and he ended up having an accident and Lina had to go clean him up. In the meantime while Lina wasn't supervising her, Emma had gone to Lina's art room (she is a professional artist) and played around with her art supplies. She ended up destroying a few of her paintings and brushes.


When Lina got back, she got mad at Emma and brought her back to my house. She told Emma to explain what she did, and she told me that she had played with Lina's art stuff. Lina then showed me pictures of her art room after Emma had played there, and I admit, it looked awful. I apologized profusely and told her that I'd have a talk with Emma. Lina told me that it wouldn't be enough, and that she needs me to pay for all of the damages. I told her that she shouldn't ask me to pay for all of it, if her daughter also had her part in ruining the stuff. Lina told me that her daughter knows not to ""touch her stuff"", and that Emma did it all by herself.


I took Emma inside and asked Lina how much I'd have to pay. She told me the amount, and it was almost in thousands! I'm not doing well financially and told her that I can't pay that amount. She started yelling at me about how Emma ruined her artwork and brushes and how that's a huge financial loss for her, but I just asked her that if I don't have that kind of money, how am I supposed to pay for it? At this point my boyfriend came to the door to tell her to leave, and Lina left with the other kids she had with her. 


A day or two afterwards, she came knocking on my door with two of her relatives (man and a woman) and they all just started talking loudly at me and telling me that I should pay for her art supplies. I got angry and told them that Lina should've supervised Emma if she wanted to make sure her art stuff would be untouched. They all seemed to get even angrier and then the man asked if I could pay for it partially now and the rest later. I don't have anything to take the money from, and at that point I was just so done I said ""nope"" and closed the door.

Ever since that, I've been receiving messages from Lina/her brother/her cousin/her SIL/just basically all of her relatives telling me to pay for Lina's art stuff and threatening me with court. I think they're overreacting at this point and I'm just so done with them. I don't know what to think.

AITA?"
"AITA for using the money I won in a lottery to finance my own dream vacation across Europe/Asia besides on my kid’s student loan debt? | On my birthday this year, I treated myself to 50 bucks in lottery tickets, and managed to hit one of the huge $50,000 payouts. After taxes, I had ~$34,000, so I’ve put $7,500 into my wife’s car, and put the rest into a high-interest bank account. I’m planning to switch jobs early 2020, but first, I plan to travel for the month of January and half of February across Asia and Europe. I’ve never had a proper vacation (unless you count weekend trips to Disney World for the kids) and have really wanted to take the chance to go out there and explore the world.

Well yesterday my daughter Emily were talking about the job movement and the topic of the vacation came up. I told her about how I’m financing it with the lottery (she previously did not know about the winnings) and Emily went quiet before saying “instead of wasting 25 grand on a vacation, why not do something practical like maybe spend $5,000 on a vacation and help your daughter not graduate with mountain of debt”.

I told her that I’d be happy to co-sign loans for her, but I was only willing to pay upwards of $10,000 of her education (the amount I promised both her and her brother when they were 13-15). She said even after paying that off, she’s looking to be at being $29,000 in debt by the time she finishes school. 

I told her that really sucks, but reminded her that I offered community college as an option years ago when she was applying to schools, but she insisted that she didn’t want to “miss out on the prestige” (she got into Dartmouth). I talked to her about how transferring was an option, but she ultimately picked that route.

She’s brought up how the 10k I gave Jason (my son) was enough to completely pay for college cost + some extra spending change, because he got a state scholarship that paid for 100% tuition. She argued how it’s not fair that I was essentially willing to pay all of his college but leave her with a mountain of debt.

I told her that he’d be able to argue the same thing if she got more money than he did. Ultimately, the line I drew was that both children get equal amounts and I can choose how I want to spend my money, end of discussion.

I thought it was over but it turns out that she went and talked to my wife Amy about it behind my back. Amy tried to “persuade” me to make it a 2-3 week vacation as opposed to the 1.5 months I had planned. I told her the same thing that I told our daughter, and then SHE then got mad and said that I’m being selfish and using all of the money that for myself (nevermind the amount I put into *her* car AND the fact that she used ALL of a $5,000 inheritance on cosmetic plastic surgery 4 years back). I told her this vacation was non-negotiable.

Now I have two women in this household giving me passive aggressive looks and eyerolls. I feel like they’re both acting entitled to MY shit; am I really being unreasonable here?

EDIT I'm not leaving my wife behind; she can go for 10 days. She can't take the full 1.5 months off, though."
WIBTA for returning to sender? | So my bf dumped some roaches he gathered at his friend’s house on my floor as a “prank.” I was so pissed and I can’t get rid of them now and they are destroying my home. He apologized when I told him this and laughed saying it wasn’t a big deal. Ive been to his place and he doesn’t have roaches so I wad wondering WIBTA if I dumped his gift to me in his house?
"AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend for talking on the phone in the library. | I have been dating her for 1.5 years. She’s a great person and all, but she is one of those girls who don’t seem to understand that libraries are for studying. She’ll regularly go to the library with several of her friends, take up a table, and treat it like the coffee shop. She’s been told off by people trying to study and then she acts like the victim.

This is why I rarely go to my school’s library with her. Im one of those people who need absolute silence to study. Yesterday, she said she wanted me to study for a hard exam with her so I agreed. However, she gets a call from her cousin or something and decides to have a full on normal voiced convo right in the middle of the dead silent library. Nearly everyone within 10 feet turned to look at her. Yet she didn’t even seem to care, just kept talking. I was SO annoyed and told her to stop, but she just glared at me.

Her convo went on for like 10 mins and I got so fed up I just packed my things and left. I wasnt going to waste my time trying to study while also listening to her talk about her cousins new dog. I went to another floor of the library and left her there. She texted me “where r u” and I ignored her.

Then after several hours, I texted her saying that Im sorry, but I really need to study for this exam, and I can’t be distracted. That night when I got home I texted her again and said that I really thought what she did in the library was rude and I don’t want to be with such an inconsiderate person. She freaked out at me and said I was overreacting. I told her she needs to learn to be mindful of other people around her.

TL;DR: Gf had a phone convo in middle of silent library, I had enough and broke up with her over it. AITA?"
"AITA for not supervising my stepdaughters slumber party when my husband had to go into work for an emergency? | 
My stepdaughter (Sammy) was going to have a slumber party at our house with her friends this weekend. I didn’t want to be here while it was happening, so I made plans to be at my friends house that night. I was planning on going to my friends straight after work.

My husband called me towards the end of my work day. Something bad happened at work and he was going to be there for a while dealing with it. He asked if I could reschedule my plans with my friend so I could stay home and watch the girls because he’s probably not going to be able to get home until very late.

I told him I could reschedule to stay home and watch Sammy, but he would have to call the other girls parents and cancel the party because I couldn’t watch all of them. 

Other than this we have a pretty good relationship , but its almost a week later and Sammy is still upset at me about it.my husband understands I wouldn’t have been comfortable with the responsibility, but still think I could have done it since it was a last minute emergency and Sammy and her friends had been looking forward to it for awhile.

Edit. I was told to add a few things by some people who commented.

First that the amount of kids at the sleepover would have around 9-10 and they’re I. The first grade.

Second that I have some pretty bad anxiety issues that I’m working through right now and that’s why I didn’t think I could be responsible for that many kids at once.

Third I didn’t just bail on my husband. I told him I wouldn’t be able to handle that many kids when he brought up the party weeks ago. He said it was fine for me not to be there because he still wanted to do the party.

Fourth I don’t hate kids. I love my stepdaughter and take care of her on a daily basis.

Fifth my husband didn’t get home until 2 am"
"AITA for allowing the girls on my HS track team (I’m the new head coach) wear bikini tops and cut off shorts for a fund raising car wash?; | This is very fresh, posting from my phone and a throwaway because I’m honestly nervous about how big this is going to get. I just got an email from the assistant superintendent of the entire district that I have to be in his office Monday morning and I’m scared shitless. 

Basically I just graduated college and got my teaching certificate last year. The school heeded a track coach of the program would fold so I volunteered even though district guidelines (not rules) specify that a certain number of years is required before taking a head coach position but the principal waived this. We have some very talented girls and I enjoy it. 

We were scheduled to do a car wash fund raiser this morning. On Monday one of the girls asked me if they could wear bikini tops and cut off shorts. They argued it was for thier comfort since it’s about 80 here today. I was a little nervous but agreed. Apparently word got out on social media and we had a line of cars 30 minutes before we even started. I’m so naive I thought initially people were just being charitable but when I saw boys from surrounding schools I knew somthing was up. And it wasn’t long before older men started taking notice and we had a line where it was taking an hour to get a car washed. The girls themselves loved it, they all had fun, nothing bad happened (thank god) and all are proud of themselves for how much we made. 

Parents are furious with me and obviously it’s gone up the chain. I’m hoping to god I can chalk this up to my inexperience and I’m not fired buf when I had a 6’4” dad screaming in my face that he’s going to get my fired...I’m scared. 

Am I the asshole for allowing this?

Edit: Just as a quick update, in rhe last few minutes I've gotten two texts from parents offering me thier support and willing to show up with me Monday to at the very least talk about how out of line the dad was who screamed in my face, that makes me feel a little better."
"AITA if I don’t change the food I cook just because my boyfriend wants to eat other food | I (25M) live with my boyfriend (26M). We split the house duties and I have to cook ( as he doesn’t really know how to ), which I don’t really mind as I really like cooking. I basically cook what I like, pasta, meat dishes, etc. 

My boyfriend liked these foods and never said anything about them. Until recently he complained how it was all “fattening” food and I cooked a lot. Now, I admit I do cook a lot of food but because we both eat a lot. And yes, many of the foods I do aren’t your typical healthy salad but because neither of us like that, we prefer more “real” food. But he is now complained how he doesn’t want to eat much of that food and how “we are already gaining weight” ( and yes, I did notice I have gained some weight and he also seemed like he gained a bit, but it’s not really something significant or to be worried about). 

And look, if he wants to eat more salads or rice, then he can but I don’t want to change what I eat and I won’t cook something I won’t eat. So either he cooks his new food or eats what I eat. But he now complains how he doesn’t know how to cook and I should cook because it’s my house duty.

I really don’t want to cook his food. If he is paranoid about gaining weight it’s his problem, not mine. Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for thinking my gay classmate's voice is annoying? | I have a gay classmate who has a stereotypical gay person's voice. It's not that I think guys shouldn't have high voices or stuff like that, I just think his voice sounds super grating. I am gay myself, so I'm not being homophobic.

"AITA for yelling at a teenager? | Little tosser (about 13/14) hit a poor little cat with his bike despite me yelling ""look out!"" about three bloody times. I don't think he meant any harm but Jesus Christ, how hard is it to fucking look where you're going? I gave him both barrels verbally and he looked like he was about to cry when I stormed off. 

Honestly if I wasn't pretty sure it would get me arrested in this oversensitive day and age I'd have taken a page out of my Mum's book and clipped him round the ear. I think he got off pretty lightly."
"AITA for telling off my “number neighbor?” | Pretty tame compared to other things people post on here but I’m still wondering if I overreacted a little. In case you’re not familiar with “number neighbors,” it’s this stupid Twitter trend where you text the next phone number up or down from yours on the off chance you get a funny response or become best friends or whatever. It’s basically bothering a stranger to get a reaction and a screenshot to post. 

I had only heard of it briefly from the occasional memes they produce but I was contacted by one of mine last night. As a little context, I’m an incredibly light sleeper and falling/staying asleep is at least an hour+ ordeal. I usually keep my phone on silent at night but I had forgotten to silence it before bed (this has happened before and it was never an issue because the late night text phase of my life is essentially over). 

I get woken up by my phone going off a little after 1 o’clock this morning. I check the notification and don’t recognize the number, I didn’t even draw the connection that it was basically my number with a digit changed because I was half asleep. All the text said was “Hi ! I’m your number neighbor.”

I was super annoyed but I put the phone down and tried to go back to sleep (which took several hours as per usual). I saw it again this morning when I got up and got re-irritated all over again. I decided to reply:

NN: Hi ! I’m your number neighbor 

Me: did you really need to do this at one in the morning 

Me: did your need for attention/something cute to post on social media justify waking up a complete stranger

Me: here’s hoping 0328 (my other NN) is more considerate than you are *gif of Tyrion Lannister giving a very unenthusiastic cheers*

Needless to say I haven’t heard back. My husband said I should have just left it alone because it was probably just some dumb kid. Did I overreact/AITA?

EDIT: literally as soon as I hit post they texted back saying “I’m very sorry, have a good day” and now I feel kind of bad

EDIT 2: woooow there are some salty ass kids in this post, reading some of these replies was a total trip. A few commenters mentioned it’s probably a generational thing and I completely agree. I also agree that I generally overreacted in my reply and was responding based off crabbiness and lack of sleep. Will set up a DND in the event that NN 2 comes knocking 😂. Thanks everyone!"
"AITA for asking my boyfriend to pay off my car loan or buy me a new car after he totaled mine? | Hi All,

&#x200B;

A month ago my unlicensed (DUI) boyfriend insisted he go to the store to buy me bottle of wine to celebrate our 9 months of dating. I initially rejected the idea and he pressed it in an attempt to do a good deed, I eventually gave in. About 40 minutes later I get a frantic call from him, he had been in a car accident. When I got to the scene the car was a wreck, it was confirmed by both the police and the other driver involved that my boyfriend was NOT at fault.

&#x200B;

Well I got my insurance payout and I still owe $1200 on my loan. My boyfriend bought himself a car that I can ""use"" until he gets his license and I can't afford to get a new car and still need to pay off my loan. My boyfriend also offered to pay my loan and then I can pay him back. Problem is I feel like he should pay off my loan or buy me a new car since he put my in this shitty situation but he feels like since he wasn't at fault and I had a shitty car that he did me a favor.

&#x200B;

Should I ask my boyfriend to financially contribute?

He did receive a hefty fine ($350) and may have delayed the process on getting his license back which he was eligible to get when he wrecked, just never got around to it.

I am currently using the car to go to work and take him/pick him up from work. The insurance for the new car is also under my name since I'm using it. He offered to split insurance and pay for gas every other time. "
"WIBTA for involving children into our childfree relationship? | When I graduated college I donated sperm to a sperm bank. I had an idea in my head that only college grads could donate sperm (didn't end up being the case) and figured it'd be something to do when I graduated as a ""aha I can do this now"" thing. I mostly forgot about this 20 years later.

I've been with my wife for eight years. We're both childfree. I'm fixed, she's fixed, we're happy. We don't hate children we just don't want any of our own. My wife has a chromosomal disorder which means her children have like an 80% chance of having a malformed heart (she herself was born with TOF and had to deal with multiple heart surgeries in her life). We didn't want to put our children through this so we decided to just not have any.

Two months ago I got contacted by a 19 year old girl and her sister. Allegedly I'm their father: their mother used the sperm bank and had twins, once they hit 18 they requested the info from the sperm bank who gave them my info and they stewed on this info for a year before finding me on Facebook. I've met them and they look strikingly like me. They both also have a relatively rare genetic disorder that I have. I'm convinced because there's so much evidence for it.

I want to be a part of their lives but my wife hates this whole arrangement. They're not children, they're adults. They don't want to live with us, don't want money or support, they just want to be friends with their bio-dad and presumably my wife, too. I don't see the harm in being involved in their lives even just a little. My wife is adamant they're never to come to our home, she doesn't want to see them or talk to them, basically wants nothing to do with it. But she also wants me to have nothing to do with it.

I'm torn for the reasons I mentioned: they're not children, they're adults, they ask for nothing except friendship. WIBTA if I continued to having a relationship with them?"
"AITA for muting my friend on a online group call without letting her know? | My friends and I (20M, we all around 20) go into a group facetime call and just chill and talk on it. Sometimes we play games, but we mainly just talk, we usually call for literal hours.

Theres this one girl in our group call, that has recently started learning how to play the ukulele.

It's great and all, but its really annoying to hear it over the mic, shes not bad, but she makes alot of mistakes, she keeps plucking strings until she finally hits the right one, which is what makes it such an annoyance.

I've literally asked her a handful of times to stop because its really loud over the mic, whenever I do she just starts singing to drown me out.

When were playing games, all I hear in the background is a shitty ukulele and a decent voice.

This past monday, she joined the call and she was holding her stupid ukulele. I clicked on her icon, and muted it. Since then I've muted her during all the calls because it seems like all she wants to do is just play the ukulele, I've realized that she doesnt even notice because she never talks. Not one of my friends in the call said a word about me muting her because I assumed they all agreed it was annoying as fuck.

Today she found out that I was muting her without her knowledge and she bitched and cried about how much of a dick move it was to do something like that, and now everyone is acting like I'm a POS. If everyone had such a huge problem with it, then they should have said something. AITA?"
"AITA for rescinding parental access to my daughter when my ex-wife got a pitbull? | 39M is me, 37F is my ex-wife, we have a daughter 4F. My ex-wife and I divorced when she was 2. I have primary custody and my ex-wife has visitation whenever she wants and has weekends. We're amicable, it was a clean divorce.

My ex-wife ""rescued"" a pitbull whose 7 years old. He's a mammoth of a dog. I like to think she's a responsible dog owner but I'm leery about the whole situation. I don't want a dog breed who is prone to violence near my child, especially without my supervision (I'm referring to weekend stays with my ex-wife). 

My ex-wife is single so if something were to happen, I sincerely doubt she'd be able to help break up a dog attack. These aren't small dogs, they're big and strong. I told her I was uncomfortable with things and she's done nothing about it.

I decided to rescind her parental access if ever she is left alone with our daughter and the dog. I'm allowed to do so provisionally while I speak to my lawyer. I have the right to rescind access if I feel my daughter is unsafe, so I'm in talks to get our parental arrangements changed to have no more overnight stays while the dog is involved.

Am I being the asshole?"
"WIBTA if I broke things off with a guy without explaining why after finding Tinder on his phone? | I met this guy over a year ago. We’ve been together(ish) ever since, but given the pacing of our lives at the moment and the fear of committing so young, we’ve never been exclusive while dating but we aren’t exclusively friends with benefits either. I really adore this guy, we just click, I would do anything for him, he’s wonderful and kind and I could see a future together if I thought it was viable.

Fast forward to yesterday: We were out on a date and when I was looking to play music in the car on the way home, I saw he had Tinder on his new phone. Quick math, he just got a new phone, which means this has been downloaded within the last month of us being together.

And it just rocked me. I wasn’t sure what I was expecting and I knew it was always a possibility but it still hit me like a train at 90mph y’all :( I could barely speak after because I was just like overwhelmed at how to decide how to feel about it. Because technically, he didn’t do anything wrong - I’m not angry at least, because we’ve never established that we were exclusive but at the same time, it’s been over a year and a couple months and we are significantly closer than we’ve ever been. To be clear, he is in no way the asshole, and I certainly wasn’t snooping on his phone in anyway.

We are about to move away from each other and I’ve already told him after he asked that I would come visit him in his new city, but with this whole Tinder scenario I have to start thinking, is this a good idea? I can pay for it no issue but like emotionally is it smart? The app still being on there has just made me question everything about us, made me feel so insecure - in my body, in my relationship to him, to his friends, where I even was to the point I couldn’t handle that loss of confidence and I wept all night when I got home even though he has every right to do so.

The problem is I don’t really wanna explain all this to him. I don’t wanna tell a guy, who has Tinder on his phone after over a year and odd months of being together, how insecure his feelings or lack thereof, make me feel. And then I also worry that by explaining to him how he’s hurting me, he’ll offer to be more serious and I don’t want it to come about that way. I want him to tell me, without my prompting, because at this point I worry I’ll always be insecure in my relationship with him if I move things forward and he continues to passively exist in it. But I know he cares about me, in his own way, and I know me giving no explanation or lying about the reason would absolutely wreck him. 

So the takeaway is - WIBTA if I just ended things with this guy with no explanation? The thought of opening up to this guy when I know he’s gonna reject me makes my stomach turn but I don’t wanna be the asshole by just leaving him in the dust and starting over in a new city if that would make me one."
"AITA for letting a kid go hungry? | Yesterday was my sister's (8) birthday and I was off of work, seeing as it was a nice day and I live about half an hour away I decided to pick her up after soccer practice (about 6ish) and do what ever she wanted to do.
She wanted to get a pepperoni and cheese Pizza from Pizza hut and go to our local park and throw rocks in the lake.
I agreed and went and got a medium pizza, which is enough for us and a couple bottles of water from a local convince store. She was hungry after practice so we sat at a picnic table and ate first, while we were eating a kid who was. Completely filthy came over and without asking grabbed a piece of pizza and just started chowing down, I immediately shut the box and asked him what he was doing, another kid of a similar age came and tried to open the box, I then stood up and held the box where they couldn't reach it. The one that just showed up started screaming he was hungry and it wasn't fair that I ""gave"" his brother a slice. I told him I had done no such thing and had they of asked I would have shared. The one burst into tears as who I can only assume is his mother appeared and asked what was going on, he explained how hungry he was and that I wasn't sharing. The mother then asked me where my manners are and told me I should share because her kids are hungry and not everyone can afford to feed their kids pizza. I told her i have no problem with sharing and she should teach her kids to ask before interrupting strangers. She told her son to ask me politely, and he said ""Gimme pizza, please?"" and I said absolutely not and their mom began trying to take the box from me saying how her. Kids were hungry and how they had no money and how she couldn't possibly treat them like I was treating my sister, which she refered to as my daughter . She even tried getting my sister in on it asking if she learned how to share better from her dad and telling me I was going to hell for starving her kids. I was over it and grabbed my sisters hand and looked the mother dead in the eyes when I threw the rest of the pizza in the trash. No way I was eating it after this random dirty kid touched it.
In the moment I felt justified but I can't help but feel bad and wonder if the mom really couldn't feed her kids that night.
Edit: mom was clean and kids had nice clothes. At the time it just struck me as kids who wanted a snack after playing."
"AITA for putting my 16 year old daughter on punishment for 3 months for smoking weed? | Gonna keep it short and simple. I busted my 16 year old daughter smoking marijuana. I put her on punishment for 3 months (No tv, come home straight after school, no car, no friends over). I feel as though I’ve even been somewhat lenient with my punishment.

I don’t care if she smokes or drinks when she’s an adult, but I feel as though if it’s a rule in my household then it shouldn’t be broken and I’m not in the wrong for punishing her for doing so, however my wife seems to think I’m going overboard since all kids try weed at some point and am being an asshole. So AITA?

Edit: I foolishly forgot to include that she drove home high, raising my disappointment even higher."
"AITA for yelling at a co-worker for not washing his hands after going to the bathroom? | Today I (M) walked into the bathroom to use the urinal. Just as I’m finishing up and doing my “shakes” I hear one of the stall doors open and someone walking out. I hear a few more foot steps and then the door to the restroom opening and closing.  No running water from a faucet, no sound of a paper towel being pulled from a dispenser. 

Without thinking i quickly zipped up, ran to the door, opened it up, and poked my head out. The bathrooms are down a little hallway about 20 feet long that lead to the break area so it was pretty obvious the guy I saw walking into the break area with his back to me was the same guy who was just in the bathroom. I yelled “Hey! Next time wash your hands! That’s gross!” He turned and looked at me wide eyed and when I was turning back to go wash my own hands, I noticed there were 3 or 4 people in the break area who looked at me and then at him. I washed my hands, dried them, and when I came outside, both the hallway and break area were empty.

I don’t work directly with this guy but I saw him about an hour later as I was walking to lunch and he literally turned around and went the other way when he saw me. 

I’m not a total germaphobe...in fact my wife accuses me of being gross sometimes. But in a common area like the workplace, the least you could do is run your hands through some water to make it seem like you’re being somewhat sanitary. I kind of feel bad though for calling him out in front of other people....but if he did this once, I’m sure he does it all the time. And that’s just...gross. 

Am I an asshole?"
"AITA for expecting my stay-at-home husband to have our house be immaculate when I get home? | I am the full-time breadwinner and my husband was laid off. He occasionally sells stuff online now to have extra spending cash. We do not have children and he is a part-time student. The deal is that I cook and work, he cleans.My expectations are as follows:

Daily chores: Dishes done, kitchen counters wiped down.

Weekly chores: Both of our laundry done and put away, carpets vacuumed.

Bi-weekly chores: Floors mopped, tubs cleaned, house dusted.He has shirked his responsibilities lately and is starting to do more social things or work on hobbies. I do not mind him being social, but I mind that my quality of life is being brushed off in favor of it.

Am I being unreasonable?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Additional info as per multiple comment request.

State of the house: Black and red mold in the tub, stained greasy kitchen floors, laundry piling up on the couch. The laundry is the least offensive to me, the other stuff is just plain unsanitary."
"AITA for disagreeing with someone on parenting methods? | At work today one of my coworkers, Linda was talking about her daughter. She's just been for a parents evening, and everything was 100% positive. Her daughter has applied to a very prestigious/selective university and though formal offers won't be sent out for a while, according to the teachers has a very strong chance of getting in with her current progression. She was really happy and we were really happy for her. 

I have two children. Danny (14) and Molly (12). When they were born my husband and I had very specific ideas on how to raise them. We value kindness and empathy above anything else, and we taught our kids those values. We taught them to be kind, to never judge, to always play fair, to stand up for themselves and others, and most importantly the value of hard work. We discouraged them from being competitive with each other or anyone else. The only person they need to be better than is the person they were yesterday. They are two truly lovely kids and we're very proud of them. 

We also promised never to push them in any particular direction. My husband had a ''sports dad'' who put him under huge pressure to break into the world of competitive sport. We promised that we wouldn't be those kind of parents, whether it be sports, academics or anything else. We do encourage them to work hard and offer as much help with school work as we can, but there's no pressure to be top of the class and so long as they aren't struggling at school - which they aren't -  we've never had an issue. We've already said we will support them in whatever possible path they choose so long as they work hard at it. 

When I was congratulating Linda about her daughter, she suggested that I mention it to my kids to give them ''a nudge in the right direction''. I said that while I would mention it to them and suggest it as something to aspire to, I wouldn't ''nudge'' them towards it. 

Linda didn't understand why I wouldn't push my kids towards ''the best possible path''. I said that I would rather my child grew up kind than intelligent. 

Linda seemed quite offended by this, has been blanking me the rest of the day, and didn't say goodbye when we headed home which she usually does. 

I feel like I've offended her. I appreciate that my parenting style maybe isn't conventional, but I did my best to explain why I wouldn't push my kids towards a pathway. I don't see why she'd be angry because of that."
"AITA for telling my sister ""I have a name you know"" after she told my todler brother to ""go that guy"" ? | My (22M) younger sister (18F) and I are home for spring break and we've gotten along okay for the most part. This morning she was playing with our toddler brother and told him ""go to that man/guy"" , can't remember exactly what , and I told her ""I have a name you know"". My sister's mood changed immediately and the rest of the morning she acted out towards our parents. I asked her if she was okay and she said no, then said me telling her ""I have a name"" was rude. 

I told her to piss off and get over herself because I thought that was incredibly trivial. She knows I'm typing this post and is actually on the phone with our mom telling her. 

So, was I the asshole in this situation ? She's making it seem like I'm the trivial one for posting about this to get everyone else's opinion

Edit: Although I admit that it wasn't the best way to respond to her after asking her if she was okay, the fact that she got so mad over that kind of thing was so ridiculous to me that the only response I had was what I mentioned earlier."
"AITA for waking up my GF everytime I wake up, because she snores loudly and I can't get back to sleep otherwise? | Basically the title.

My (M22) GF (F21) snores very loudly. I hope it is only because she has a little bit of a could right now and it won't be like that forever. So every time I wake up in the middle of the night, there is no way for me to fall asleep again. I will just shift myself a little bit, forcing her to wake up.

I really dislike doing this but I also don't want to just lie there the entire night listening to her. AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT:   
First of all thanks for all the answers. She does know, that she snores from time to time. I just didn't want her to tell her about it, because I didn't want her to have trouble falling asleep, because she worries about snoring. Sadly it is reeeaally loud, so I don't think any kind of earplugs would be able to dampen that enough for me to not hear it anymore. 

For those who said, that she is sick and needs the sleep: I do agree, but I think we are sleeping enough for that not to be the case. According to her the sickness also doesn't hinder her on doing anything anymore, since it has almost cured. And since I'm also infected and don't really mind, I think I can believe her. 

I will talk to her about it, since I shouldn't continue doing this without her consent. Thanks for everyone who replied :)

"WIBTA if I filed a PayPal dispute for a commissioned piece of art that looks nothing like the people I'd be gifting it to? | I wanted to get a custom Harry Potter themed portrait done for my friends and their 2 kids. I posted on Reddit asking for potential artists and found a girl whose style I really liked. I reached out, told her I was looking for a theme where my friends and their kids would be dressed in the wizarding clothes, have Hogwarts in the background, etc. She said she loved the idea and was super excited to get started!

She sends me her first draft (super rough sketch) but I said I didn't love it because the people were so small you couldn't really see them all that well. I sent her an example of one I'd seen on Etsy and said I wanted something along the lines of this, where the people are the main focal point, and Hogwarts in the background. She said sure, no problem!

A couple weeks later she sent me the final portrait and the people look *nothing* like my friends and their kids, but I really loved the rest of it! Hogwarts, the wands, their clothes, etc. It was literally just their faces that I'm so disappointed in. She said she'd rework it, sent me the new one, and same thing - they look nothing like them. I said I really don't want to spend more money, but if she felt like she could do something different and not have them be the main focal point so it's easier to capture their essence I'd be willing to pay more. She just keeps saying ""it's really out of her comfort zone"" and it's not really her style. I paid good money for something that I now will never give my friends because I'd feel embarrassed. I understand in art there will be some variation , but I could ask everyone who knows my friends ""who are these people in the painting?"" and 10/10 would not know. If it's too far out of her comfort zone and she can't do what I asked, I think she should have turned down the job.

So, WIBTA if I tried to get my money back via a dispute? I know PayPal has a disclaimer about handmade/custom items not being disputable, but I work for a company that makes handmade items and we've lost disputes before.

EDIT: People seem to think I asked her replicate the Etsy image because this girl would have been cheaper than Etsy and that is not true, I literally paid the exact same amount for this girl as I would have on Etsy. I only sent her the Etsy image because it was roughly the idea I wanted and I wanted her to put her own twist on it, which she did and I loved her result of the background/wizarding garb she did. The faces are my big hang up.

I wanted to try and find a more local person/someone who didn't have a well established Etsy shop just to support people who weren't where they wanted to be yet in their career. I have definitely learned my lessons as far as communicating my expectations, asking for previous portrait comparisons, and splitting the payments.

Edit 2: she did a digital drawing, just since a lot of people are asking/wondering."
"WIBTA if I punished my daughter for not taking care of her medical condition | My daughter(8 yrs old)  has a medical condition that causes some bowel issues. Before it was treated, she would regularly poop herself. She’s on medication but still has to be very proactive about going to the bathroom more often than most people and she can’t really risk just farting(sorry I know this is gross). 


That said, she’s NOT proactive about going to the bathroom or managing where she farts. She will poop herself and continue playing for about 30 minutes-hour before she goes to the bathroom to change. Sometimes she won’t even go change until I can smell her and make her go do it.



I’ve told her repeatedly that she needs to stop doing this. It’s incredibly unsanitary and gross. I know she can help it because she never poops herself at school or when she’s staying at a friends house.



WIBTA if I started punishing her when she poops herself and continues playing? I’m just so over cleaning shitty underwear and having to police my EIGHT year old pooping herself."
"AITA for adding a work requirement on a scholarship I am funding? | I had to work two part-time jobs to pay for school. That set me back even further because I didn't have time to do any meaningful internships or volunteering so I had to hustle for a long time before making it and I did it without any connections. It was like every college student that I went to school with did not have a job. Their parents supported them financially in one way or another.
I decided to fund a scholarship at my alma mater. The requirements aren't too much except that the award can only go to students working more than 20 hours a week. I funded four scholarships covering a year's tuition plus expenses and it's been available since Fall 2019 and not one person has gotten it because every person who applied for it doesn't work.
The school administration asked that I drop the work requirement because it's preventing ""needy"" students from continuing their education (and because so many students are applying for it), but if you cannot afford school and you don't want to work to off-set the costs then I think you're just being lazy. No, college doesn't require someone to be studying 50 hours a week and college is not a right. It's not lost on me that a lot of students who do receive financial aid ended up dropping out anyways so I want the award to go to someone who shows that determination."
"AITA for telling my friend that he needs to stop going after girls that are out of his leauge? | Listen I'm all for guys having confidence in themselves and going after girls that they are attracted to. But after so much rejection and everything else, isn't it a saying that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result?

Couple things going against my friend:

He just turned 27 and he is a virgin. Now there's nothing wrong with that but he's never even kissed a girl in all 27 years, never had a GF or anything close to it. 

My friend is very short (5'3"") and he is not in shape. He wants to get in shape and goes to the gym but his diet is terrible. He eats the same thing everyday: cheese quesadilla for breakfast, tequito's or pizza rolls for dinner, whatever fast food he can find for lunch. He's afraid of trying new things and is just very awkward around women. 

He keeps developing crushes on these girls that he has no shot with and then gets frustrated when they ""friendzone"" him. He likes going after extraverted, party girls who like clubbing and going to bars and I told him, he's not the type of guy these girls are looking for. 

So I told him, if you aren't blessed to be born tall (or even average height) and handsome you need to be at least 2 of the following three: 

1. Good looking 
2. Great personality
3. Successful in your career 

Now good looking is something you can't help sometimes but at least be in shape. Great personality means you can make girls laugh or you're a great conversationalist or easy to get along with. Successful doesn't mean rich but at least have a stable job and the ability to provide and pay your own bills. 

I told him if you aren't any of the above 3 then why would any of these girls want to date you? He needs to lower his standards but he got all pissy when I said that, saying ""I'm not gonna lower my standards like these girls are better than me"". Blah blah

Am I the asshole for trying to be real with him? "
"AITA for cutting off financial support to my ex wife and kids | I was married to my ex wife for seven years, during which we've had two children, a girl and a boy. The girl is special needs and requires additional sessions with medical doctors for communication skills an social conduct.

I divorced her five years ago in less than amicable terms, following which she decided to take our children and move to another country without my consent. Despite this, and the fact that she never requested child or spousal support in court, I've been sending them money on a monthly basis so as to ensure that my kids will have all the necessities in their new home. Furthermore I've made an effort to visit them on a yearly basis, even though they're thousands of kilometers away from my place of residence.

I've stopped making the monthly payments on two occasions:

The first time my ex requested an additional payment of 500 Euros supposedly in order to purchase clothes for my kids, and I found out that she used all the money to buy herself a plane ticket back to her natal country for vacationing, following which I made it clear to her that if she's going to misuse the money I send her for the children I am under no obligation to continue this practice in good faith. After I received assurances that no further misuse of the provided funds would take place, I resumed the monthly payments.

The second time my ex requested a significant sum for school fees for the two children, and due to the fact that I had paid a significantly smaller sum on the previous year, and that I had not received a copy of the relevant invoice which I had requested (both for tax purposes and to verify I was not being lied to), I requested from the ex to provide me with the school's liaison so as to settle the payment directly with them. She got immediately abusive and defensive, acting offended that I don't trust her (major red flag for me) and that she supposedly gets a different rate with the school than I would due to her being unemployed. After another string of abuse from her end, as well as her stating that she doesn;t need me because she's found another man to take care of her and the kids, I told her clearly that due to her refusal to provide evidence that she's using the money I send her on my children, as well as due to her continuous abuse towards me, I will no longer be making any payments to her.

I has now been a year since I've last send her any money, with no communication from her end. I've send her a message on WhatsApp requesting she verify her present address in order for me to send the kids Christmas gifts but have received no reply.

AITA for no longer sending money for my kids to my ex?

EDIT: Thank you for all your responses so far, just wanted to reply to some frequent questions:

1. Why didn't you take your ex to court on kidnapping charges?

A: Because I don't want to traumatize my kids by having police officers drag their mom away in handcuffs and them being taken into CPS, even for a short while. Despite all her actions, I still believe we can settle this in a civilized manner without getting the authorities involved.

2) Why did you allow them to leave the country in the first place?

A: I didn't know they were going to leave. I left the ex and the kids in my own apartment and moved out, I visited weekly to bring groceries and take the kids out to the park as the ex was pretending to be ill from my leaving her. She did ask me for plane ticket fare but I refused, apparently she sourced the money from elsewhere or she had saved up her own. The border agents should have stopped her but did not, don't know why or how she made it through but she is a citizen.

3) Why don't you ask for full custody of the kids?

A: I could do that, but it would not be enforced unless the ex came back to my country with the kids, which I've been led to understand will never happen. The decision for the custody cannot be enforced by foreign states, the mom and the kids must reside within the country's borders.

EDIT2: Because apparently it's important, according to my lawyer the amount I was willingly sending monthly was significantly greater than the MAXIMUM child support that would be ruled for my income - roughly 50% more, in fact. This may also explain why the ex refused to go to court for child support.

UPDATE: Once again, thanks to everyone that offered constructive comments and criticism. I have decided to try to get in touch with the ex and start providing some financial support once again, not having any restriction on how she uses the money but requiring nonetheless that I have weekly contact with the kids over WhatsApp. As someone correctly commented, if the ex doesn't want to behave as an adult, I have to be a big enough adult for both of us and ensure that the children are not affected from their parents' falling out. I guess my bitterness on being taken for a fool by the ex didn't let me see the whole picture and realize the wider consequences of my actions. 

So far, I haven't been able to reach the ex - either she changed her number or just reads my messages without responding - but I'll keep trying."
"AITA for wanting to buy a new car even tho my GF is furious about it? | English is not my frist language, so I apologize in advance.

To start off, I recently bought a car (august 2018) and have had it since then. It's a decent car, drives well, nice tech and decent fuel economy but doesn't have the ""power"" of a car with a turbo (it's a Mazda 3 2.0 120hp naturally aspirated).

I'm a spontanious person by nature and I do and buy stuff off the bat when ever I feel like it (mostly minor stuff) and I normally dont ask permission from anyone. Sometimes I buy stupid shit, but I don't ask anyone for help financially because it's my own fault if I do.

When I bought the Mazda I did it way to rushed and didn't really think much about it. I didn't research anything about Mazda og asked anyone for guidance. I just bought it.. Done deal.

The last 4-5 months I've had bad feeling about the car not in a sense that the car is bad or is breaking or anything, but because it wasn't the car for me. This time i've done a whole lot of research and I've found a new car I want. It's within my financial limits (tight but manageable) and I REALLY want this one. 

My GF is not good with spontanious things in general. She likes things being planned ahead of time etc.
I presented her with my idea and we had a rather ""hefty"" argument about our future etc. She thinks that we wount be able to do anything in our spare time becuase the car would cost to much monthly.

I'm thinking on buying it anyway once the right deal presents itself. AITA for wanting to buy something that would, objectivly, make me happy?

I apologize if the story is incoherrent. Please ask for more INFO is its insufficient.

EDIT:
We do not share finances other than rent, food and household items etc.
EDIT2:
Thanks for the many different responses! There seem to be a misunderstanding when I said i didn't have a plan for my current car. I dont intend on keeping my current one but selling it for the right price.
The car i've been drooling over is a Alfa Romeo Giulia 2.0t super 200hp from 2016. Older but more expensive than my current one.
EDIT3: We've talked about this and everything is all good now. I'll wait with buying a new car until the right conditions are met. She understands my POV and I understand hers. I apologized to her for not including her in my thought process and she apologized for wanting to control my finanse."
"AITA for telling my friend I hate my sister and that we only pretend to like each other for our youtube account? | Me and my sister co-own a youtube channel that is moderately successful, the thing is we do NOT get along. Cause of the YT premise we are the perfect ""sisters"" who get along and all that BS. The whole channel started when she was featured in one of my early videos and we had good ""chemistry"" and people wanted more of her. We have to hide the fact that we frankly don't like each other, if anything we are co-workers who have to put on a face to the boss (in our case the viewers are our boss)

My friend who has seen our videos asked me why we do that when from what she has seen we don't get along. I told her that its all for the money and that we can't stand each other, and that I strongly dislike her. She just kind of had an awkward laugh and that was the end of the conversation.

THEN the next day she posted a comment on our video about sibling rivalry (go figure) saying that she knows us IRL and that we can't stand each other. She deleted it a couple hours later but I'm still pissed she would post that, my sister asked me who that was and I told her just one of my friends. She got all pissed cause I was ""talking shit about her"" to other people and I put our jobs at risk.  I told her to calm down and that she deleted the comment.  My sister told me to keep my name out of my mouth.  AITA?"
"AITA for how I responded to someone bumping my carriage with theirs at the store to get me to move up in line? | So I was just at the grocery store and I was unloading my carriage in line. I walked around the side of my cart to the front side (opposite side from where one stands when pushing the carriage) to pay at the terminal. I hadn't yet moved my carriage forward, but apparently I was accidentally blocking the person behind me in line from pushing his carriage forward enough to unload his items.

Why he didn't walk around IN FRONT of his carriage like I did, where he would have had more space, I do not know... but he insisted on forcing me forward so far that he could unload his items standing on the push side of the carriage.

He was probably about 75 years old. He didn't say a word, he didn't say ""excuse me"" or ""please move forward"" or anything. He just started bumping my carriage with his own, pushing against my carriage with his own aggressively. I ignored it for a second thinking it was an accident, but he persisted.

Finally I turned, said ""Can I help you?"" and he kept bumping my carriage. I asked ""Are you trying to ask me to move forward?"" I didn't shove back, but in a very agitated voice I said:

""I am only saying this once. When you want something from someone you use your *words* like an adult. Use your manners, say PLEASE and THANK YOU. I should not need to explain this to you, you should know it by now. Don't bump into my cart again. Got it? Good.""

And I didn't move forward at all until I had finished paying and was exiting the line. He never asked me, never said please or thank you, and never verbally articulated his request. 

Someone in the next line over said that I was being ""aggressive"" and ""could have said it more nicely."" As far as I am concerned, the other man was the aggressor, I did not physically push back, I simply used my words to explain why his behavior was unacceptable. He does not get a pass due to his age."
"AITA For showing my 2 year old daughter a giant anaconda eating a bunny | Monday is my father daughter day. This past Monday I took my daughter to the zoo. It went about like you'd expect. We had a blast, but I wasn't sure how the snake habitat was gonna go. We tried it, and she winced a bit at the bigger reptiles. No major freakouts. We get to the giant anaconda, and it's very obviously devouring what was once a cute bunny. Daughter looks away in horror. I stay and watch, daughter in my arms. Eventually my daughter starts watching with the same amazement I had. We moved on, and daughter quickly forgot. She loved the primates and acted like a monkey the rest of the day. 

I get home later, mom says I probably scarred my daughter for life, and I'm an extra big AH for doing that so close to Easter. I think mom might be right. I feel kinda bad now. "
"AITA for keeping my fuck buddy’s baby after we both thought I was infertile? | Small backstory: I’m 27. I’ve been seeing my fuck buddy Nate for a year, about every week or so, and I was married for 4 years before him (my husband left me because he realized he wanted to start a family and “he couldn’t do that with me.”) As the title implies, I was told when I was 12 that I am infertile.

I told Nate that I am infertile at the beginning of our relationship. I don’t really date anymore because of what my husband did to me. I told Nate the reality of things; I’m infertile, and I’m exclusive to him (he can see whoever he wants). If he wants to double up on protection, we very well can. If he doesn’t, that’s fine too. He ended up choosing the latter.

Well. I still don’t know how it happened because I was told “with absolute certainty that I cannot get pregnant” (side note, can I do anything with the doctor who’s said this to me; would this be malpractice?). I’ve had pretty bad pregnancy symptoms for at least a month (just didn’t think it was a possibility so it didn’t even enter my mind), so I have no idea how many weeks along I am. My appointment is on Monday to confirm but I’ve taken 3 pregnancy tests already.

I told Nate later that night, and he was less than thrilled. He asked me if I was leaning more towards abortion or adoption, and I told him that honestly, I really don’t think I’d have another chance like this, and I’m thinking about keeping it. He then said and I quote “if you’re keeping it, I’m having absolutely nothing to do with that child; you’re on your own.” I was kinda pissed off because I told him if he wanted to use a condom, he could’ve; he had that choice and he chose not to. He can’t just not have ANY involvement in the child’s life, and I told him this and that he will still contribute financially, and I will take him to court if I have to.

He started calling me horrible names, which is COMPLETELY different than how he normally acts. I no longer felt safe and left his house.

I don’t really want to tell anyone in my personal life, because I have no idea how far along I am, and I don’t want to miscarry and lead to all of this conversation of if I’m infertile/fertile, etc. I feel kind of shitty because I can see his side. But at the same time, it’s MY choice. Wanted to come to Reddit to see if I’m being unreasonable

EDIT: My wording was confusing; I edited for clarity. My doctor told me with absolute certainty that I CANNOT get pregnant. That’s why I added the bit in parenthesis

And also, I glossed over the infertile part because it wasn’t necessary. But it’s not like I was told one time “you’re infertile” and this was the last time this medical complication was EVER mentioned again. I don’t want to get too much into specifics, but I have regular check ups with my primary care physicians, including an ob-gyn. We have always operated under the assumptions that I was infertile because of said condition. Jesus Christ, do you guys really think a lifelong complication would’ve been mentioned one time to a 12 year old and that’s it?"
"WIBTA if I called my boyfriend out for his Christmas stockings? | Hey all. This may be a little silly. My new boyfriend recently hung up two Christmas stockings with our first name initials on each. The thing is, I know these stockings are from when he was dating his ex girlfriend as 1) our names start with the same letter and 2) I’ve seen pictures of these stockings from when they were dating. Basically he is recycling Christmas stockings he and his girlfriend shared in the past with me. WIBTA if I called him out on this? Thanks in advance. 

For what it’s worth, they broke up 2.5 years ago."
"AITA for wanting to focus on my school before getting married? | I met my current girlfriend of 4 years while we were in grad school. We were both very physically active but were passionate about teaching. After a year of dating, we both graduated and wanted to get our Phd's. She was accepted into a very good program while I wasn’t but took a fantastic job in a different area. During that 6 month process, I felt empty and lonely while she was extremely reluctant for me to move closer. We still wrote each other letters, I would have flowers delivered to her office and we still stayed together. I felt that I was the glue holding things together while feeling confused by her reluctance. I was able to secure a work form home position with a stellar internal team at my job, so with her blessing, I packed my things and moved.

Over the next 6 months, I noticed there was still reluctance on her end. Her PDA limit on campus was zero ( it's the work place, understandable ) but the tentativeness of me being around always odd to me. Her department secretary would melt in her chair when I'd swing by asking when my gf would be out of the office so I could plant a surprise on her desk. That spring, I wanted to bring her flowers for valentines. I knew where she was teaching that day so I wanted to put the flowers in the room she would be teaching in; girls like getting flowers but girls LOVE getting flowers in front of other people. I asked a few students around if they were going to her class. One student agreed. That night, she blew a gasket and told me to never do that again. She said that I crossed the line, interacting with her students and giving her flowers while she was teaching. I was very, very confused.

That spring, I was also accepted into my own grad program at the same school. The next two years was me being tossed around by a poorly ran department while she was getting ready to graduate. I ended up being kicked out of my program for not passing their exams. Fortunately, I moved to another department.

At this point, our relationship did a complete 180. I had started focusing on my school to help give her the space but she had since started demanding less space. She has secured a job about 1.5 hours away and wants to get a place together in between our schools ( 45 minute commute for each of us ), plan our wedding ( not engaged yet ) and expresses that she's getting ""old to have kids"" on a weekly basis. Part of me thinks I should be ecstatic since this is the reciprocation I had been desiring in the past while another part of me thinks that I should focus on my PhD and that I deserve that time & space I gave her. Whenever I bring up the past, pointing out that I gave her that space in the past and that I actually would appreciate being able to finish my degree without having to plan a wedding, travel 45 minutes every day and think about having kids; that is always met with some sort of ""it was different back then"".

Am I the asshole here?

&#x200B;

Edit: I really, really appreciate all of the insight and comments. Had a very tough but very necessary conversation together tonight. Also, TIL that giving flowers on Valentines day at work isn't necessarily a good thing."
"AITA for refusing to pay back SiL for the weed me, my wife, and our friends smoked? | So last week was my wife's birthday, and we had a whole day to ourselves as her brother said he would watch our kid while we go out. We haven't smoked in years and she brought up the idea for us to get some weed from her step sister, let's call her Judy, and grab an Uber to the movies and a dinner after smoking. It sounded like a lot of fun, so I suggested a couple of our friends come along as well. In total there were four of us, and all of us are super lightweights since none of us had really smoked since we became adults. We asked Judy if we could buy some weed off her, about 20 dollars worth. Instead of selling us some, she decided to invite herself to smoke and rolled a big ole blunt of what she called ""some of the best shit she's ever had"". She then told us not to worry about the money and to consider it a gift. 

So later that night, we are all taking hits and passing, with myself and my wife getting baked after 2 hits, one friend of mine taking one hit and bailing and the other friend taking 3 hits. During this time, Judy decided she would take a hit in between each person's turn because she, in her words, ""didn't want to waste good weed."" We were all baked and happy and went on our way to have a great time at the movies and dinner.

The next morning, Judy shows up at the door and asks if we have the money for the weed. When my wife politely asked about her saying it was supposed to be a gift, Judy said ""I was baked out of my mind I can't afford to spot 20$ worth of weed. Plus the stuff we smoked last night was worth way more."" My wife, not wanted to start any conflict, went to her purse and grabbed a 20$. This was when I told Judy that we will not be paying her back and that she shouldn't have offered if she wasn't going to stay true to her word. She got upset and stormed off, calling me all sorts of mean things. My wife then yelled at me for being an asshole, when really I don't feel like I did anything wrong. I understand it wasn't my gift so I suppose I didn't really have a say in the matter, but it really just seemed rude and disrespectful to my wife in my eyes. AITA?"
"AITA for requesting to be seated away from a family with children including one with special needs child do to their noise level, causing them to leave the restaurant? | So, last night to celebrate new years me and my wife decided to go to a fairly fancy restaurant nearby. The place was packed and you needed to make reservations to just get in. When we got in we were seated and things were going well, until another family was sat next to us. It was a mother, father, and 3 children. Immediately we both knew there was going to be an issue. While the restaurant was busy and a little noisy it was nowhere near the level the three children were at. 

One of the children was obviously special needs and was having outburst every few minutes while the other two were making quite a bit of noise. At first I decided to put up with it, but eventually I lost my cool when the special needs child started to scream and threw crayons they brought with them around (one of them landed on our table). 

I got up and asked (I though I asked kindly, but my wife says I came off a bit harsh) for them to get control of their children and to conciser the people around them. They apologized for everything and began trying to get everything under control. 

This is where the second problem comes in, to keep their children entertained they pulled out a tablet and began playing videos on it, at full volume with no headphones. I got up again and told them to ""turn the damn thing off"" or get them headphones. I could tell they were both embarrassed and they apologized again but said that they could not get headphones due to their special needs son (they specifically called him this so I know I was not just guessing) being uncomfortable with it but said they wouldn't be able to turn it off.

At this point I stormed off to get the manager. When I got there I demanded a new table away from the other family. The restaurant was packed so this wasn't an option so the manager brought me with him and asked the other family to leave. The mother looked like she was about to cry and the father grabbed his kids and stormed off. 

My wife would not talk to me the rest of the night and at home told me that I was wrong for how I acted. Honestly though I don't feel bad at all. The restaurant is pretty expensive and we only go there once or twice a year so I believe that I was within my right to want to enjoy a meal I play for without hearing kids screaming or a tabled blaring. Am I wrong?"
"AITA for not giving someone a lift because they're obese? | I'm a university student and with the whole current issue that's going on campus has been  shut down and people are going home. Most of my flatmates/friends live pretty far away so I offered to drive people back as I'm the only one with a car, we all live pretty near each other (1 hour away mostly) and public transport is a mess.

One person who isn't really a friend is extremely obese and wanted to take one of the places I was offering. The issue is however that she is morbidly obese and easily takes up 2 places and in my eyes I'd rather help 2 people rather than one. I told her I can't offer her a place as I'm full, but she then found out from someone that I was still telling people I had room. I was trying to not embarrass her as she has terrible BO due to her size and I'd rather not spend 5 hours in a car with her. 

She went off on me in the message group and called me all sorts of names, so I just replied ""You take up the same amount of space as 2 people"". This set her off again as she's all about the fat acceptance movement and started mouthing off at me again. I was tired of dealing with her so just replied ""I accept your body choice, my car does not"" and ignored her.

She's still mouthing off but I'm not reading it, the 5 other people I'm giving a lift to aren't saying anything but a few people are going off on me."
"AITA for getting a tattoo that says “ok boomer” | I’m seventeen and a male. I’ve wanted a tattoo for a while but my parents have always been against it. They told me if I got an A average before midterms they would give me consent to get a tattoo. The image specifically was a dragon, but not a gigantic one or anything.  

Well they finally gave me permission to get a tattoo and my mom came to the tattoo place with me. She basically gave consent and then went to wait up front. I was no longer that into the dragon image so I asked to get a tattoo that says “ ok boomer” and a pic of this girl who says ok boomer, it’s a tiktok/twitter thing and hard to explain but it’s got big anime energy too. They did the tattoo and it looks good but my mom is mad that I took advantage of her (her words not mine) to get an “ageist” tattoo. The tattoo is across my chest, not on my face so it will not impact my career. Thoughts?"
"AITA for staying at home on Christmas Day and drinking Prosecco in my PJs? | I’ve done it for the last 2 years now whilst my OH goes off and sees his family and I have the most amazing day.

‘Family’ to me leaves a bit of a nasty taste in my mouth. My mum and dad are divorced and cannot be in the same room, one brother lives in Oz and other brother is of the same opinion as me.

I have spent FAR too many Christmas’ running round after other people and generally not enjoying myself. I’m sure my mum and dad would love to see me but dad lives 90 minutes south and mum another 90 minutes even further south. Both parents are assholes and so would get upset if they knew I saw one but not the other on Xmas day. I tried for a few years to see them both to make them happy and, in turn, it made me miserable. So I decided it was only fair to see neither.

Along comes OH with his nice normal family who do an overwhelming meeting up session on Xmas day but by this point I was devoid of feelings for the 25th December. I tried spending time with his family instead of mine but I still hated it. 

The first year I got away with it and OH accepted it, the second year he was away in Thailand with his family so I didn’t need to justify myself. This year, he’s calling me selfish as apparently his mum would really like to see me? Doubtful.

My argument is that if his mum knew I was only there because I think she wants me to be there but actually I’d rather be at home, drinking Prosecco in my PJs, that would make her upset.

Surely Xmas day is about doing what makes you happy. If that’s spending time in a busy family home ripping off the paper from presents and eating turkey, that’s fine. But if it’s sitting at home alone, that’s also fine?

TL:DR Christmas can be a really shit time, I want to be on my own, is that so bad? 

Top tip - doing what I do also means that you see your family after Xmas and so can buy all their presents in the sales."
"AITA if I don't want my daughter spending time with my husband's family? | Myself and my husband Scott have been together 8 years. I'm 28 and he's 26. We have a daughter, Lucia, who is four and we finally married last year. 

Scott and I come from very different. He is a tradesman, but is skilled enough to earn a very good wage. He left school at 16 and spent all the time working and developing his skills. His family are very working class and are proud of their roots. 

I come from a very different background. My parents are both professionals. I was privately educated and have been to university, and now work in finance. 

Scott's parents themselves worked incredibly hard to build a better life for themselves, and they instilled that work ethic into Scott and his brother and sister.

The problem is that Sam and Charlotte (his brother and sister) see him as a sellout for marrying someone from a different sort of background to them. It's never been said but I know they consider me to be a spoiled brat who has always got what I want. In the past Scott has been made fun of for being with ''one of *them*'' as though my background makes me different. Scott's parents have never been anything but lovely to me and his mum even says that I'm like a second daughter.

Yesterday Scott and Sam had a bit of an argument about parking spaces at a family dinner. When I tried to say something in agreement with Scott, Sam's wife Mel shouted for me to shut up and called me a ''posh b****''. I was so upset and ended up crying in the car. 

I've told Scott that I don't want Lucia seeing his side of the family- with the exception of her grandparents. Charlotte and Sam both have children who are around the same age, but I feel like the kids are going to be raised to think that Lucia is different because she's half ''posh'' and will be bullied due to her parents attitude. 

Scott thinks I'm overreacting but if that's how I'm treated why wouldn't my daughter be treated the same way?"
"WIBTA if I made my partner tell his mum he cheated on me | Bit of back story: When my partner was younger his dad cheated on his mum, it obviously really tore her up and they ended up getting divorced, and yeah his dad is kinda just a piece of shit. My partner always swore up and down he would never be like his father... guess the apple really doesn’t fall far from the tree.

So this weekend I found out my boyfriend has been doing some pretty fucked up and shady things behind my back, honestly I’m so devastated, I never thought he would be THAT guy and I don’t think I’ve ever felt so betrayed and hurt, he’s stripped me of any self confidence I had left, he’s made me question my sanity and my judgement/gut feelings... I’m basically just really fucked up all this.
I haven’t made a decision about weather I’ll break up with him or not (I know I’m silly) I do still have so much love for him, we have been through so much together. Now, his mum fucking ADORES me, sometimes I think she likes me more than she likes her son, and if she ever found out about what he has done to me she would kill him, I considered telling her myself but I’m starting to think that a good way to teach him a lesson/see if he’s actually serious about continuing on with our relationship (he’s been begging for forgiveness) Is making him tell her himself, I think maybe then he might just feel some of the pain I’ve been feeling... to have to look in your mother’s eyes and explain how much of a piece of shit you are while knowing she raised you better than that.

So WIBTA if I made him tell his mum? Is it a petty move? Is it right to want him to hurt like I do?

EDIT: okay it’s pretty clear I’m the asshole, thankyou guys for making me pull my head out of my ass before I did something really stupid.. really shouldn’t be thinking like that when I’m not in a good frame of mind, lesson learned!"
"AITA for saying I was giving my wife a break | Wife and I have constant issues surrounding the division of childcare that we are slowly working through. Things were getting better but they exploded yesterday. The short of it is that my wife was spending time with our kids when I got home, and I said something along the lines of “do you want me to take the kids out and give you a break?” To my wife. She said yes but later that night she got upset with me for saying I was giving her a break. She feels that my language implies that taking care of the kids is her primary responsibility and I’m doing a favor by taking them. I think she’s reading too far into it. I’m not looking for advice on how to solve this, but I would like to know if I’m the asshole so I can have some more perspective moving forward."
"WIBTA if I asked my neighbor to clean up their yard before we put our house on the market? | Hey Reddit, the thought of even doing this gives me so much cringe and embarrassment I'm starting to think it must be the wrong thing to do. 

We're about to sell our home (townhouse with backyard separated by wooden fence) and over the span of winter, my neighbor's have let their large dog destroy their yard with dog poop. You can see into your neighbor's yard when you're looking out the second floor deck. The entire community has green grass and then looking into their backyard, all you see is completely yellow dead grass with loads of dog poop on top. It's a minefield. Now that it's getting warmer, if you're outside playing, you can smell the poop. 

We've lived here for over ten years and have always been friendly. We're not close friends, just smiles and waves if we see each other outside but not a friendship. My husband even mows their front grass in the summer because our front yards are connected and they are very thankful, as the owner is older (but has grown sons in and out of the house). 

Anyway, I'm afraid potential buyers will see the minefield and be turned off from making an offer. WIBTA if I asked them to clean up? I'll even offer to do it myself but I feel like I'd be insulting them and they'll be defensive and angry. I like my neighbor's and don't want to cause any potential drama before we move...




EDIT: I did not mention we do live in a community with a HOA and we are required to keep our grass cut and to remove animal waste. If I put in a complaint, they would be required to clean up. I thought it would be better to speak to them directly instead of them possibly being fined. "
"WIBTA if I reported an ice cream truck for trespassing in my apartment complex? | Every day since December, for approximately two hours, an ice cream truck drives the loop around my apartment complex. To clarify, this is the parking lot (in the shape of a loop around the complex), not a regular road. He stops in front parked cars and empty spaces for extended periods of time. The apartment complex has signs at the entrance clearly stating “no trespassing” and “no soliciting”. There is no way to miss them. It’s a gated complex so he must be timing it when the gates are often open for people coming home from work. The office is closed by this point as well. 

I don’t want to seem like a fun-hating dickhead, but I’m either going to be on night shift schedule or will get home right as he’s here and just want to sleep but will be unable to. Either way, I want to sleep when he’s here, but I can’t. He stops outside my bedroom window much of the time, waking me up. 

So yeah, he’s here and he shouldn’t be, but kids love it. WIBTA if I reported it, even though it’s technically not allowed for him to be here?"
"AITA for giving my vegan cousin’s kids animal produce | Okay so I’ll start this off by saying maybe I am the asshole. I’m a student so I have all summer off, I had a week off work last week and my cousin was going away, she asked if I would look after her two kids (age 7 twins) for 4 days. I happily obliged as they’re great kids and I hadn’t seen them in a while.

So my cousin is a hardcore vegan, she’s almost militant in her ways. Her kids have never eaten any animal produce. I totally support veganism and was vegetarian for years but I feel that the effect this is having on her kids is harmful, growing children need nutrients. The kids are very frail, pale and they’re constantly getting sick, they lack the energy and enthusiasm that most 7 year olds have. 

The first day they stayed I made all vegan food for myself and the kids, as their mother instructed. The kids were becoming curious about the food I had in the house, even normal everyday things like eggs and cheese. They asked if they could have some. For breakfast the next day I made them eggs and toast with butter and they LOVED it. They had never eaten it before and it lit up their little faces, I just couldn’t say no to them for the rest of the week. I didn’t give them that much meat because I know their digestive systems wouldn’t be used to it but we tried a small bit of fish and chicken. 

They were totally different kids for the time they stayed with me. They had so much energy and got really involved in every activity I planned, I had never seen them like that before and neither had the rest of my family.

Their mom picked them up on Wednesday afternoon and within half an hour I received a very angry phone call from her. She told me that I had no right to feed her kids “poison” and that they will never be seeing me again.

So AITA here?

Edit: 
CPS has been called on her before. They did an inspection and didn’t deem her unfit to parent. I’ve been through the care system before and honestly have very little belief in them because they allowed me to stay in an abusive environment when it was obvious what was going on.

Also she did not pay me for looking after the kids or contribute any money towards vegan food that I had to buy."
"AITA in telling a coworker that her interest is irrelevant? | Hear me out-

I work with animals, in a boarding facility setting. A sad reality of the job is that sometimes people abandon their pets with us. 

We currently have a dog who may have been abandoned. The powers that be (corporate) have delayed our procedure for surrendering, because they want to be sensitive to the current situation in the world. However, we do suspect this dog has been abandoned and are preparing for the signal to go.

When pets are abandoned with us, we do our best to rehome them. We have to surrender them to a rescue first, but generally what will happen is we turn them over to the rescue with someone already lined up to adopt once the waiting period has passed.

The dog we have now is a year-old high demand breed. People pay thousands of dollars for these dogs, and they’re very trendy right now. They often have an array of health problems, potential behavioral challenges, and require plenty of exercise. 

One of my coworkers, D, has expressed interest in adopting the dog if/when she is surrendered. D seems financially responsible, has a home with plenty of space, and would be able to bring the dog with her to work for exercise.

Another coworker, R, got upset when she heard that D had already expressed interest, and said that no one had talked to her about it and she would be interested too.

R has three cats she can barely pay for, lives in a tiny apartment, and has a long commute on public transportation to work. When I realized that she was serious about the dog I told her flat out that her interest was irrelevant, citing the aforementioned factors.

I think R was hurt, but I just wanted to prevent the situation from escalating. It would be unreasonable for her to try and adopt the dog over D, who is in a better position to care for it. No one in their right mind would adopt to R.

Some of my coworkers think I was harsh, and I agree, but I think I was justified. AITA?"
AITA for telling a friend in legal trouble my sister is a lawyer. | I'm(15M) and my friends family is in some legal trouble his dad is fighting a really stupid drug case. Well I told my friend(15F) that my oldest sister(28F) is a lawyer and I can give her family her contact information. So I did that and not even 3 hours later I'm getting yelled at for giving them my sisters law firm she works at. I didnt fully understand what kind of firm my sister works for and her firm is more insecure and social security. Well my sister yelled at my mom and my mom yelled at me. I was just trying to give my sister business and it didnt work out I don't understand why they are both mad at me!
"AITA for cancelling a trip to see my best friend because I dislike her fiance? | Mobile. Throwaway account because I don't want either of them to know I'm me. Sorry this is a long post.

I (30's, f) and my best friend (30's, f) have been best buds for about 20 years despite multiple moves and huge life changes, both of my own failed marriages and some bad relationships on her part as well. We've always been there for each other and it's been a great ride.

So, she's with this guy (and I used to live in that area as well, so we have met and hung out on various occasions) for years now.  I've tried really hard to like this guy, talked to him in person, or on messenger, and in the background of our phone calls.  Several things have put me off of wanting to talk to him.


I planned a trip out to see Friend which would involve me driving a considerable distance (more than 8 hours) to spend 3-4 days there, and come back. I asked for 1 day where just the two of us could have a girls day (go get our hair done or pedicures, do some shopping, and maybe grab a fancy lunch or dinner somewhere with a glass or two of wine). All good, she wants a girls day and has missed me, and we're both getting excited about it.


Two days later, we're discussing our options and he walks in and commences to start putting in suggestions for things we might enjoy in the area for our girls day. I'm pleased to see that he's actively supporting of the two of us getting some time together. I comment that he brought up some good ideas, BUT THEN HE SAYS, ""I'm really looking forward to playing chauffeur for you two...""


Full stop. This was supposed to be a 'just the two of us' day. I explain this calmly. And he gives me a lecture about how as women, we are vulnerable out in the city and he's just tagging along to make sure we're both safe because it's his responsibility that I make it home safely if I'll be visiting them because having guests means you take full responsibility for their well being while they're there.


I came up with an excuse to cancel the trip because I feel like his need to constantly babysit and chaperone the behavior of two women in their 30's is messed up. I'm not a child, neither is my friend. We were functional adults before he came into her life, and I am supremely pissed off that I can't get one single day with my best friend in the world. 


AITA for cancelling, or should I have sucked it up and gone on a trip to see my best friend and her fiance?


Edit:I had a discussion with her shortly after the exchange I described in the post (but 3000 character limit). I've also had discussions with her about why I dislike him in general.


Concerning this specific incident, I explained that I don't feel like we need a babysitter and I don't want to spend a couple thousand dollars on a trip (because I would be getting a hotel) and blow through half my vacation days for the year in one go if Im going to feel like I'm being monitored while I'm there. She said he was just concerned for us and wanted to help us have a fun and safe visit. She says she gets where I'm coming from, and explained that he completely doesn't understand why this seems unreasonable to me. And that makes me feel like I AM being unreasonable.


Edit 2: By, ""I've had discussions with her about why I don't like him,"" I mean 5 discussions over the course of the last two years. Once when he was bashing her religion which she's very passionate about. Once when he tried to claim her success financially as being due to his own efforts (she worked hard and worked her way up in her company, created a budget and worked hard to save money. He encouraged and supported her in all of this, but it was unfair to say it happened 'because of him'). Once when she called to vent that he had yelled at her after a traffic accident. Once when he tried to set me up with a friend of his and told both me and her that I was being a jerk for not going on a second date. And once for this ordeal."
"AITA for asking for gas by the gallon not dollar? | So I(me) was in line at the gas station (SE:station employee) just now, me and my coworker (GOG:grumpyolderguy) was behind me with no one else in store. I had a 5 gallon can of gas to fill and wanted a can of tobacco, so it unfolded as so:

Me: I need 5 gallons of gas and a can of grizzly winter green longcut.

SE: How much?

Me: um... 1 can please.

SE: No Gas.

Me: 5 gallons.

SE: How much does that cost.

Me: (laughing thinking she was kidding me) probably an arm and a leg, but the boss is paying so i get to keep mine.

GOG: DONT BE AN ASS SALTINWOUNDNEEDED. PEOPLE ARE WAITING.

ME: Um...(still only us in store) Sorry, i just need 5 gallons if you have a calculator i guess i could figure it out.

SE: Dont you have a cell phone?

Me: (visably confused) uh its in the truck...

SE: Ok then, next in line please.

Me: WTF? 

SE: Sir please step out of line till you figure out how much you need. 

Me: shit just gimme 11$ and ill come back for change.

SE: that wont be enough.

Me: what would be enough?

SE: (disgusted with me) I told you i dont know.

Me: shit ma'am at this point i dont think it matters i just want gas and to leave.

GOG: (Angry now) LET ME PAY FOR MY SHIT I CANT BELIEVE YOU, QUIT BEING SO DAMN DIFFICULT

SE: (looks past me) what can i get for you sir.

Me: Just gimme my dip and 11$ in gas first, im not sure what the problem is?

SE: (rolls eyes and rings it up)

(Me and GOG leave, hes been bitching at me for 2 hrs now about how ignorant people my age are and how he cant believe how difficult and entitled I was acting and how if i ever go in another store hes not going in with me.)

Im seriously confused, i know i dont always read social situations the best. AITA? Hes treating me like i did something unbelievable.

Edit. Lemme give you some back story. I was in the store for some dip and GOG was getting a water. ONLY 2 PEOPLE IN STORE or parking lot the ENTIRE time.  Boss calls while im in store and says ""fill up that 5 gallon can while your there."" We werent even at the pump yet. Theres no sign visable  with the by the gallon price anywhere except strait up on a sign you cant see from the ground but can see over the trees on the interstate, maybe from the road. But not from the store. So yeah you tell me how you would of done it? 

Everyone else, thanks im avoiding that store like the plague. I felt guilty after GOG hounded me but today he was naturally an ass about everything and i realized this will be a daily thing with him so i just quit talking to him completely and turn up the radio when we have to go anywhere. Have a good one guys."
"AITA for picking the ""wrong"" engagement ring? | My girl and I have been together for 4 years. She doesn't wear much jewelry, so over the course of our relationship I think the only jewelry that I've bought for her was a pair of novelty earrings. But it was time to propose to her, so I went ahead and picked out an engagement ring. I know I didn't really know her tastes in fine jewelry, but I didn't want to suddenly ask a bunch of questions and give away the surprise I was planning. So I just picked out a ring that I thought she'd like with the help of the lady at the store. (It's gold and has one square diamond in the center, and two long rectangular diamonds on either side of it.)

Long story short, she hated it. HATED it. She started crying and saying that I didn't know her at all and that I clearly didn't know her well enough for us to get married. I thought that was an overreaction and I said so, and then it just kind of spiraled into a fight. Things have settled down now (this was a couple of days ago) but neither of us have broached the subject of the engagement or the ring since then. 

I spoke to my 2 sisters about it, and they took my girl's side and said that I should've made every effort to get her the perfect ring. I just feel like everyone is being ridiculous. Why can't we just go back to the jewelry counter and exchange it for something she likes? I don't love her any less because I didn't realize that she prefers round stones!

Anyway, am I the asshole? Do I owe her an apology here?

tl;dr: proposed with a ring my girl hates. I think her reaction was over-the-top but my family sides with her."
"AITA for bringing my switch & my iPad to entertain me whilst waiting for my wife to begin labor? | I have a Nintendo switch obviously for playing video games and I use my iPad mini for reading ebooks.

Wife got pregnant for the second time. The first time, she was in the hospital for almost 44 hours before going into active labor and because I couldn’t leave her side, I was just bored out of my mind. This time I want to have a little something to entertain myself as we are waiting. I obviously won’t let her sit there and talk to her self, I’d only use them while she is sleeping or “out of it” (for lack of a better term). 

We’re preparing to head to the hospital and I’m packing a small duffel bag with some of her favourite snacks and some spare clothes, and I threw the iPad and the switch in there for good measure. She noticed it and asked me to remove it. And I Asked why. And she’s like, you’re not seriously gonna be playing on that thing while I’m pushing a baby out of my arse, are ya? (I laughed a little bit which might make me the TA lol) I said no that I’ll only be using it when  really really bored or when you’re sleeping and that when you’re awake I certainly won’t be playing it, and when you’re in labor then I’ll be tossing it back in the car. I was a little bit surprised because she was so hostile with her reaction and she basically said she doesn’t want me bringing the devices anywhere near her. As a matter of fact she even went so far as to say that she’d ban me from the delivery room if i did bring them, which I think is a bit ridiculous because it’s not like I’m doing anything wrong, I just need a bit of entertainment because my mind starts to wander.

Anyways I ended up not bringing them to keep the peace but I’m still a bit salty I guess. AITA for wanting to bring it?

EDIT: I just want to clarify because a lot of people are making YTA judgements (which is okay) but they’re making those judgements under the premise that I’d be using those devices when she’s awake. I’d only be using them when she’s asleep."
"AITA for snitching on my class for cheating | Over the past few quizzes in my Bio class people have been cheating by erasing their answers and writing in the correct ones. We mark our own quizzes with an answer key and the quizzes themselves are worth little. Since it was almost the whole class cheating I spoke to my teacher who basically told me that she wasn’t going to watch for cheating and if people do cheat they will have to answer to God (she’s a nun) she also said she would speak to the class about it. There were a few people from my class in the room when we talked about this and they’re pretty obviously upset with me and might tell the rest of the class. The only reason I was upset about this is because this is a 30-1 diploma course and people really shouldn’t have to cheat on these tests. 

EDIT: just to clarify because I didn’t mention it, I didn’t mention names and I only said that some people were cheating. Nobodies grades were affected.

EDIT 2: I’m getting mixed answers but I agree with people saying I’m an asshole, I’m also too scared to defend myself in the comments but I do not believe I’m better than my classmates at all, my class is full of smart students and nice people, sorry if my wording made it sound like I thought they were stupid. Tbh if I was smart I would have cheated too

one last edit: my teacher encouraged me heavily to tell who was doing and to tell her WHILE they were doing it in order for her to do anything, which I obviously won’t do. Otherwise, she said she wouldn’t do anything about it.

EDIT: stop telling me snitches get stitches. I get it."
"AITA for spending a lot of time in my yard, making my neighbors feel like they have less privacy? | My friend Julia and I are renting a row house, a small city house with neighbors houses adjoining it on either side. Right after moving in, it seemed like the next door neighbors on either side already didn't like it because we are renters and they don't like that the homeowner is renting the place out. We hadn't known that before we moved in.

Anyway, one of the reasons we really loved the house was that it has a nice fenced in backyard. We're really outdoorsy people so having our little yard in the city was a dream come true.

We've got a grill back there, an outdoor dining table, a fire pit, a bunch of string lights, hammocks, a projector that we can point at the back of the house for movie nights, a reading nook, some potted plants we care or, an outdoor heat lamp, etc.

We hang out there a lot and have friends and our boyfriends over often too. Julia is polyamorous and has two boyfriends, who are both bi and involved with each other also. (I don't know how she does it, it seems like a lot to balance. But they all seem happy and they're making it work so I don't judge.)

Anyway, most of the time we're at home hanging out together or having people over, we're outside. The house is small and kinda old and windowless and drab, so hanging out outside is so much nicer. 

We grill, read books, chill by the fire, hang out with our friends, paint, etc... Out there. 

And one of my neighbors told us off for always being in the backyard, it ruins their chance to enjoy their own backyard with some privacy once in a while. He also seemed to be kinda homophobic, saying he didn't want his kids seeing the guys Julia had over ""doing their thing outside"" which I assume was just stuff like cuddling or being affectionate because they never do anything inappropriate out there. 

Another of our neighbors asked kind of pointedly if there was something wrong with our kitchen, why are we always cooking and eating outside? They want to leave their kids out to play without them overhearing adult topics. I said I'd be considerate of what I say when I was outside but as far as I know my friends and I don't talk about anything inappropriate loud enough to be overheard from their yard.

She also said something about not liking how many people who nobody in the neighborhood knows coming and going and having a straight line of sight into her back yard every day. I said ""no need to be a stranger, come by and you can meet my friends if you like"" but she hasn't taken me up on it.

AITA / Are we the assholes for spending all our time at home out in the backyard?"
"AITA for thinking if my bf's son (18/m) stays with us, he should wake up when I do? | My boyfriend and I have a 6 mo old baby. When I was pregnant I told him we needed to move as we currently were in a 1-bedroom apartment and the baby needed her own  room. When we were viewing a 2-bedroom apartment, he mentioned that perhaps sometimes his son (who is 18 and at the time unemployed) could come stay with us sometimes. I told him we could think about it AFTER we moved and the baby came, once I saw how I adjusted to the baby. I never planned on having children and, honestly, when we got together I thought I would never have to deal with his son coming to stay since he is overage and lived with his mother. I figured he would stay a couple nights with us sometimes, this is what I was told.

So, I have had the baby and my bfs has not got a new job or a better apartment for us. We make it work because we have to. But now he wants his son to come stay with us at times because he is having disagreements with his stepfather and the mother won't step in. This was one thing when he stayed a night or two. Lately he comes to stay indefinitely, this last time with literally 10 mins notice. My boyfriend will not tell me when he's leaving, he just says ""He'll want to go home soon anyways"" because (since we don't have a spare bedroom) he has to sleep on our living room futon and we have to keep our 3 cats in the living room now since the baby is in the bedroom. 

Here is where my big problem comes in. We have one working car ATM and I can't drive it bc it's a manual. I am stuck in the house with the baby all day. I love my baby, but I never planned on having kids and it takes a lot out of me. The ONLY thing I have for myself right now is playing video games. It is the only thing keeping me sane some days. Our old TV took a shit right after we bought a new one and now the new TV is out in the living room. It is too big to bring back into our bedroom and since my bf sleeps in all the time he doesn't want it there anyways. 

I only get early mornings to myself, the rest of the day is full of the baby. She will only sleep with me bc I breastfeed (we are trying to fix this), if we are out of milk I have to bring out the boob and through the day pump for bottles. So this leaves me quarantined in our bedroom all day. I have to go back there to feed the baby and pump bc my bf is so weird about me having my boobs out in front of anyone. I have to go back to put her down to nap. I'm ALWAYS with her back there since she's always eating and napping. So my solution before was in the early morning when I'm awake from feeding the baby, I would play games in the living room and the baby stayed asleep with him in the bedroom. But since his son came to stay, now he says it's not fair for me to go into the living room to play games and wake his son up at 7-10 AM. I feel like these are totally reasonable times, my bf says ""Not if he went to bed at 3 AM!"" I went to bed at 3 AM too and I'm awake. He can go to sleep earlier. I feel like I'm not asking for him to wake up at 4 AM, it's a reasonable time and if he wants to stay here he can get up when I do or figure out how to sleep through it (I keep the lights off and volume low). I would never stay on someone's couch and expect them to hide in their bedroom until noon bc I stayed up late. Also note, Stepson stays with both sets of grandparents and my bf's sister regularly, he is choosing to stay here.

This morning I got up and went out to play at 6:30 AM. The baby started waking and I went back to settle her. I got back up and went back out at 7; Stepson had exited my paused game to turn on SpongeBob (which he leaves running all night), turned the fan back on in our already freezing house that I had turned off, and gone back to sleep.

Reddit, AITA for thinking his son should work around our schedule and I shouldn't have to be sequestered in my bedroom all day bc my bf thinks his 18-year-old son should be able to sleep until noon?

Edit: His son is now employed and works at the pizza place my bf works at until he leaves for the Navy in March. However they don't work all days together. The son just works part-time and is often here all day.

2nd Edit: I also want to mention it's my BIRTHDAY and my bf still will not wake his son up. All I want is some time to myself.

3rd edit: Ok, let me clarify here. When I said ""I never thought I would have to deal with him"" I did not mean ""I hate his guts and wish I never had to see him"". My point here is to illustrate that this came up very suddenly with almost no discussion. My bf moved in with me very suddenly, this was never addressed. When we met, we both had our own houses and he had a spare bedroom for his son.

I am not the ""evil stepmother"" some people are painting me as. I have spent plenty of time with Stepson. I often stayed over at his dad's when he visited early on to get to know him. We get along great and his dad says he has never had a bad thing to say about me. I clean up behind him and cook him meals and never say a word. I LOVE HIM, very much, and hate he is going through this with his mom. We got to this point because I feel like I have already taken on a LOT by agreeing to bring him into our home that DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH SPACE. If he is going to insist on staying with us, knowing he sleeps in a common area, I feel like it is only fair that he adjust to our schedule. 

I know ""playing Xbox"" sounds stupid to some people, but it's the only hobby I have that really helps me relax right now. And, even if my hobby was painting stinky turds neon colors, I feel I should still be allowed to do it in my own living room at a reasonable time. I put the volume on low and keep the lights off, I'm not trying to run out and start a circus in the middle of the room while he sleeps. I don't think asking to play some games at a reasonable time and at low volume with the lights off, especially today on my birthday, is asking for too much or being unreasonable. 

I DO NOT FEEL HIS SON NEEDS TO LEAVE, JUST THAT IF HE STAYS HE SHOULD RESPECT OUR SCHEDULE."
"AITA for spraying wine on my stepmoms clothes? | Throw away account. 
I know I seem like the asshole but here is the background.
I’m 17, I live with my dad and his wife. 

Fashion is a hobby I have, I like to buy and sell designer clothes. I love to shop for people, I actually make ok money doing this as a part time job. 

My dad and stepmom make fun of me for it, and call me vain. They don’t think it’s a valuable use of my time, but I don’t care. It’s what I like. 

Despite making fun of me for my hobby, my step mom constantly borrows my clothes. Often times without my permission. I have told my dad about this, he says not to be selfish. It’s her house, she helps to take care of you. This pisses me off but whatever. 

I recently saved up a bunch of money and bought a white silk lined Burberry blazer. This is a pretty expensive jacket. My step mother borrowed it for what I’m assuming is thanksgiving, and put it back in my closet with a huge STAIN on it. Like she didn’t even tell me she stained it, and she let the stain SET IN for a day or so in my closet. 

I went directly to her and said, “what the fuck did you do to my coat?” And she LAUGHED and said she spilled a bit of wine on it and it was no big deal. I could just have it dry cleaned. 
I asked her if she was going to pay for it, she she said NO!!! And even if I get it dry cleaned, there might be permanent discoloration in the area of the stain. 


I demanded that she pay for dry cleaning, and if it didn’t work she had to buy me a new jacket. And she laughed again, and said “tough luck”. 


I fucking lost it at her, cursed at her and got grounded by my dad. I plotted and came up with the idea to empty some wine in a spray bottle and spray some of her white blouses with red wine. I did it. And when she noticed she was furious. She is even telling my dad that she wants me to go live with my mom, even though I only have one semester of high school left. 


My dad wants me to apologize, but I’m not going to until she pays for my coat. I don’t think I’m in the wrong here, AITA?"
"AITA for ghosting at parties? | The other day I was at a BBQ and was talking with everyone when a friend says to me ""I have a bone to pick with you"". I was a little shocked because I like to think I'm nice enough and get along with people, but I was keen to find out what her issue was with me.


""You don't say good-bye, you just leave"" is what she said, and it's true. I prefer to just leave a party and let everyone keep going. I do it because if I announce I am leaving then people often ask me to stay or ask why I'm leaving, sometimes it makes other people think ""yeah I might go too"" ending the party earlier. I prefer to just disappear. 


Anyway I explained myself to this friend and she said ""no it's super rude"". We're Australian so I told her to go fuck herself and we both laughed. After that BBQ I made a point of saying goodbye to her directly, but I still prefer to ghost. My wife isn't a fan of me doing this but she has long since accepted it.


tl;dr - I like to leave parties without saying goodbye to most people (please read the edits, I do thank the host and I now know it's an Irish goodbye). Am I the asshole?


Edit: I should note that I do try to tell the host I am leaving (if I can get them alone without causing a scene by saying good-bye) and if not I text them to say thanks. It's just everyone else I'm trying to avoid.


Edit 2: she was not the host of this BBQ, it was my in-laws bbq and she was a neighbour that was invited. I ghosted that event late into the night because my house is a few hundred metres down the road and I was 15 shades of fucked up.


Edit 3: fmd my inbox is nuked


Edit 4: TIL that this is called an Irish goodbye. Thanks for all of the support from fellow Irish goodbyers. Too all the people that think I'm rude, I accept that with open arms and will try tailor my approach a little differently moving forward"
"WIBTA for asking my husband not to take his dream job offer? | Throwaway and some details left vague for anonymity.

Background: My husband is close to finishing his degree and is interviewing for jobs in a competitive field where few jobs are available and many applicants are seeking them. He's most interested in academia in this particular field. There are other jobs available in industry and private consulting, and he's applying for those too, but he's most interested in pursuing an academic career in higher ed.

I'm also close to finishing my degree in a similar field, but I'm about a year behind him. He's applied for and received an offer for an academic job in his preferred field, which is awesome. Huge downside, it's three hours away from where we currently live, where I'm doing my degree, and from our families. It's also in a very rural area, 2 hours from the nearest metro area, and the job prospects for someone in my field are basically non existent. The one exception is if I could get a position at the same college where he has an offer. But I won't be done with my degree for another 1.5 years. WIBTA if I vetoed this job and demanded he find something else?

&#x200B;

Edit: Obviously we've talked about it at length. I'm saying if we've talked in circles about it, I've voiced my concerns, and he still wants to take it, AITA if I say no at that point.

Edit2: stated in the comments below and added here: long distance even for a short time is very complicated because we have a kid."
"AITA For telling my boyfriends mom the truth about my religious views? | I [24F] met my bf’s [26M] parents for the first time earlier this weekend. We have been together for almost 4 years and are very serious about spending the rest of our lives together. His family is also aware that he is serious about our relationship. However, his mother is very religious (Christian) and my bf is religious too. Our religious beliefs obviously don’t align but we are able to handle our disagreements and understand each other’s viewpoints. He doesn’t care that I am atheist, but he knew that if his mom found out that I am not Christian then it would cause problems with her. He’s very close with this family so he would be bothered if they didn’t like me or thought I wasn’t a good fit. So before I met his parents, he told me to just not bring up religion, or if they were to ask, just tell them that I am Christian. I agreed because I figured it would cause less drama. 

At the dinner, everything was mostly fine, but a bit awkward because I am pretty shy. However, when my bfs mom asked about which church I go to because she assumed I was Christian, I felt the need to tell the truth and it felt wrong to lie about it, so I just admitted to her that I was atheist. I figured that it was gonna come out sooner or later so I’d rather just tell the truth now rather than having them find out later. After this conversation, I felt that the mood of the dinner kind of changed a bit, but they were still polite and nice. After dinner, I went to the car and my bfs parents wanted to talk to him. When he got back to the car, I could tell he was really stressed out. 

The next day, his mom called him to explain why marrying a non-Christian girl is a bad idea etc and he was arguing with her about why she was wrong. He was a bit upset afterwards because he warned me that this was gonna happen and now he has to deal with the drama and stuff. I kind of regret telling the truth, but I still feel that it was the right thing to do. It was difficult to lie on the spot because I’m a bad liar. AITA for telling the truth?"
"AITA for telling my girlfriend she cant come to new york with me? | Note: I told her she couldn't come if she was still sick by tomorrow

My parents got me and my siblings a trip to New York and tickets to a play for Christmas, and we're all going on saturday, including my girlfriend who has never been. However, she had a fever of 102.5 yesterday, and my mom is immuno compromised due to her RA (Remathoid arthritis or something, idk the first words spelling). I told my girlfriend she couldn't come unless she's better by tomorrow, because this could end very badly for my mom. I was kinda harsh with my wording towards her, and she's never really been out of state, so she's very excited. Also, her parents helped to get a ticket for her to come with us. AITA?

Edit 1: Sounded harsh because I was ranting at her even when she said ok about how bad it would be if she got my mom sick.

Edit 2: yes my parents did agree with this.

Edit 3: I'll apologize as it seems I was unnecessarily rude. Thanks guys, it does actually mean a lot

Edit 4: she woke up and is feeling a lot better, no longer has a fever and does not feel sick. She is coming with us!"
"WIBTA for telling our buddy his wife is taking birth control? | My SO and I are buddies with Dan* going on a couple years. About a year ago, Dan married a generally nice girl we'll call Sasha. Sasha has kids from previous relationships and Dan takes them on as his own before they tied the knot.

we started to hangout both as couples playing dumb games and getting wasted, and occasionally Dan would come hangout with my SO and I on his own. During one of the times Dan hung out with my husband and I around 6 months ago, he was telling us about their struggle to get pregnant. Dan has no biological kids and is eager to be a biological father in addition to fathering Sasha's kids. He explained that she had over ""a dozen miscarriages"" and it just wasn't working out and he was obviously upset as he really wants to experience being a father in the ""typical"" sense he always imagined.  The whole thing just seemed off I guess? That's alot of miscarriages for the time they wouldve been together or whatever but I've never been pregnant/has miscarriages or anything and my SO just got snipped so I honest to god just didn't know enough to say much aside from giving my sympathies and handing him a shot.
2-3 weekends ago, my SO and I went over to their place we were all pretty drunk& Sasha pulls me aside and she tells me that for the past 6 months shes been taking BC and hasnt told Dan. I really*** wanted to clarify and mentioned how he told us that there were miscarriages and she says ""well yeah there were a couple but idk yeah I've been taking birth control for 6mo and it's like almost too late to even tell him you know?""We left the next morning and headed home when I unloaded all of this on my SO who was equally wigged out.
Yesterday Sasha started posting those anonymous question things on facebook (I dont know the name of the app or whatever makes it possible for people to get anonymous msgs) but one asked her about she and Dan having kids, and she responded that she doesnt know if she ever would have more kids. To which Dan responded  along the lines of ""idk what Sasha is talking about but we're gonna try for 2 more"" 
Obviously I'm all about a woman's right to choose anything about her body but this guy is a couple years younger than Sasha and kids are a major want for him knowing this may give them a much needed conversation that could save them both time and pain in a potentially unmatched marriage, or help initiate a conversation that's essentially inevitable? I don't necessarily want to be the friend that unloads that info on someone but that's such a huge lie that's actively causing him pain and confusion. Would I be the asshole to tell him that she told me?

Tl;dr
Friend's wife told me she was taking birth control the past 6 months, even though he told my husband and I that they have been actively trying and experienced multiple miscarriages. WIBTI for letting him know what his wife told me about her taking birth control?"
"AITA for not letting my son eat instant noodles at home anymore? | My son (12) has been addicted to all kinds of instant noodles lately. He eats them all the time at home and he says he eats them at school for lunch sometimes too. My son eats healthily otherwise and plays sports, but I don’t want him to consume that empty calorie junk anymore. I talked to my wife about this. At first, she didn’t think this was such a big issue, but I successfully convinced her to not buy instant noodles anymore. 


I told my son that there would be no more instant noodles in this house after he finishes this package. He got mad and said he was saving me money eating this. I told him about the unhealthiness of instant noodles and why it’s terrible for growing boys. He said he’ll just buy more at school to make up for it then. I just hope he’ll be sick of it soon."
"AITA for getting angry at my friend for splitting the bill on her bday party? | For the record, I was initially not even invited. It was only when one of our mutual friends suggested that she invite me. She takes us to a fancy place, pleads us to order food and drinks up to our satisfaction. When the bill was placed in front of her, she just glanced at it and placed it back in the folder. After 10 seconds, we realised she wasn't gonna pay and that's when we split it equally. It has been a well and I haven't talked or looked at her. Not that I'm broke or anything, but it's almost the end of the month and I could have easily had at least 8 meals in that amount.

TL;DR Friend invites me to bday party, realised the bill is too high, we split the bill"
"AITA for ‘betraying’ my fiancé? | Apologies if weed is a controversial topic. Throwaway account. 

Before me and my fiancé met, I was an intense stoner. Like smoke weed every day kind of stoner. 100% positive that I was psychologically dependent on it. When I met my fiancé, he told me he didn’t smoke weed, haven’t since high school, didn’t like it and didn’t want it in his life. Eventually it came to the question, well do you want to stay with me even though I smoke weed? And his answer was I don’t know. I decided to try to quit and it worked out for quite a while. Soon it became this “promise” between us. Like I quit weed for our relationship.

When I found out my mom smoked weed it sucked because it would have been cool to have smoked weed with her before I quit if I had known. She wished we had too and asked me to share a joint with her for “one and one time only” and I caved and shared one with her. Because it was my mom and I wanted the experience. Strike one. My fiancé was pissed and felt betrayed.

After some time passed (maybe a year) it was around Christmas when a lot of people in my circle were around and visiting. There was weed around and my fiancé made the decision that he wouldn’t be mad at me if I wanted to smoke every now and then, pretty much giving his consent ever since the situation with my mom and some conversations we had over the time span. I said alright and left it at that. I did end up smoking after that, but it still caused some turmoil regardless of him saying it would be okay, so after one argument I said he should never have said that and that I would just try to stop again. He said whatever. 

Fast forward to this year. My sister started smoking so whenever I come home, it’s here and everywhere. Intense triggers. In the beginning I was good. Could be around it and not do anything. But as time passed, the peer pressure got stronger and cravings too.

Now last night, I messed up. My mom was taking a bong hit and she couldn’t clear it so she handed to me in a ‘panic’ and without thinking I cleared it. I didn’t get ‘stoned’ but I felt instantly guilty. This morning, we were talking on the phone and my fiancé asked if I got high (a recurring habit when I’m visiting family without him) and I told him what happened. He hung up on me, and texted me to tell me he doesn’t trust me anymore. I finally admitted that I think I still kind of have the psychological craving/addiction and that I fucked up. And he said whatever, I don’t care what you say or believe what you say anymore.

I asked if it was okay to come home or if he wants space. His response was “Do what you want. It’s not like you care about what I want anyways” and hasn’t responded to my last text. 

AITA for smoking weed or is this an over the top reaction? 

TLDR; fiancé hates weed, so I quit, trip up and smoke, he gives me the go ahead, then gets mad when I do it, I say I’ll try to stop again, time goes by and then I smoked weed and now he no longer trusts me and doesn’t want to talk. "
"WIBTA for asking my (soon to be) sister in law to move her wedding? | My fiance and I got engaged last year, and booked a date for October 2020 at the beginning of this year. We've obviously been very excited about it and have been very involved with her family, planning and trying to include everyone.

&#x200B;

Switch to her sister, who has been with her now fiance for almost 10 years, but got engaged earlier this week. They have been in a strange ""about to get engaged"" zone for about 7 years now, always saying they'd talked about it and it was going to happen soon, but they never got around to actually organising it. Now, they've just gotten engaged and immediately decided to have their wedding exactly 2 weeks after ours. 

&#x200B;

The family is very tight-knit and even just helping us plan our wedding so far has drawn a lot of emotional energy. Both weddings will also require extended family to travel interstate to attend, and both weddings will probably need logistical and setup help from her parents and family (we are doing it on a bit of a budget). 

&#x200B;

From her perspective, she has been waiting for almost a decade for her special day and loves autumn - I don't think she has chosen this date to copy us or anything sinister. 

&#x200B;

From our perspective, we are worried about burning out our family with travel, planning, and physically helping move things around - and we are worried that this will steal our thunder for our special day which we have been planning for longer. It will also affect our ability to have a honeymoon, and the third sister lives and works overseas so will need to make two trips or take a long time off work.

&#x200B;

We are not sure if we should talk to her or just accept the decision. Please Reddit, let me know if I'd be an asshole to ruin her special day, or if we're within our rights to ask her to move it."
"AITA for refusing to kill the office spider despite one of my colleagues being scared of it? | I’ve had a spider in my office space for a few months now. She’s a cool, small, little thing who chills near my desk and occasionally I bring her lil treats to eat. Sometimes she disappears and sometimes she comes back. I’ve named her. I like her. 

My colleague Michelle is aware of the spider, and is always complaining that it’s a pest and needs to be killed. Recently she saw the web, not even the actual spider, and started an official whiteboard scoresheet if anyone is in favor of the spider being removed. Apparently she’s super scared and terrified and being even a little bit close to my office is enough to make her jittery. 

Luckily most people voted that the spider stays, but a few of her friends wrote some strongly worded notes that the spider is a sign of poor housekeeping etc. I must admit I was a little peeved at this, especially because we are a pet friendly workspace and Michelle’s own dog comes in to work sometimes and we have people who are genuinely frightened of dogs and Michelle doesn’t bother keeping her on a leash or anything. 

It came to a head when we had a meeting and Michelle bought up that she refused to go into my office because of the spider and she was scared of it. My boss was a little irritated and told me to remove it or kill it, I straight up refused and told him he wouldn’t ask Michelle to remove her dog and the spider is a LOT less threatening than a poorly behaved dog. He ultimately agreed and since then all she’s done is go on about how I don’t care about her feelings and that I must enjoy watching her suffer."
"AITA For telling a guy on the bus that he absolutely reeks | I get the same bus every morning and get on early on the route so I always sit in the same place where people don't constantly knock into you during the mad early morning crush on the bus, it's a really busy bus and is always full within a few stops of mine. Recently, somebody started getting on soon after me and sitting beside me as its usually one of the last seats available.

The problem is - the guy *stinks* of cigarette smoke. I smoke too (this is not an invitation for people to tell me to quit, I know it's bad for me and I'm in the process of getting off them), so not only do I have a really bad sense of smell anyway, I'm also not very bothered by the smell of stale smoke like an average person would.

I cannot express how awful it is. I can fall asleep with my ashtray on my bedside locker and not even smell it. But this guy eminates the smell like nothing else. I tried sitting further back, but his smell reaches at least 4 rows behind him (and sitting any further back is difficult, as the back fills up first and its really hard to squeeze past people when I get off at my stop). 

He doesn't get on every day (fortunately), but when he does sit beside me, I spray a little perfume up my sleeve (just one quirt, and directly up my sleeve) and I'll rest my head on my hand and basically bury my nose in my sleeve for the hour long journey. At first it was fine, but he's started giving me filthy looks. We get off at the same stop, and last week he was huffing and puffing after I put on my perfume and as we got on the bus he muttered 'fucking asshole' under his breath while looking at me.

So I asked 'hey man, is there a problem?'. And he had the gall to say it was bullshit that I put perfume on myself, and that it smells horrible and I shouldn't force other people to smell it. Oh the irony of that.  I kept calm, and explained 'I' m sorry it bothers you, but I'm not sure if you realise how strongly you smell of stale smoke. You wear the same overcoat each day, so maybe the smell is trapped in it, but it seriously overbearing and I can smell it even when I'm further back on the bus. I put perfume on my wrist so I can try mask how bad the smell is. I'm a smoker to, so I'm not some asshole lecturing you about smoking, but I think you need to wash your coat because it's pretty bad'.

He, unsurprisingly, got really defensive and called me out for commenting on his smell, that he has a right to smoke and I don't have to sit beside him and be an entitled asshole. I pointed out I'm on the bus before him, I can't choose where he sits, I've never complained to him about his smell, but he absolutely reeks and he can't go off yelling at me trying to deal with how bad he stinks when he's the only reason I put perfume on. Note that it's a really light perfume, I specifically asked my mom if she thought it was really musky or strong. 

AITA For telling him he smells really bad and that he's the reason I use the perfume in the first place?"
"AITA for letting my sister's dog get lost | I have a 2 yr old daughter and we went to my sister's for christmas this year. She has two dogs: a lab and a pitbull about 6-7 months old. The lab was fine but the pitbull was a monster---constantly jumping on people and tearing up furniture left and right. 

Yesterday my sister is out of the house as is her husband and my parents. My sister refused to put the pitbull in the cage and told us that he would listen to us---he didn't. We tried to keep him in the cage but he just kept acting up and even tried biting me. I was concerned for the safety of my daughter so I locked him outside in the backyard with a bowl of water. 

So apparently he ran away and got out through an open gate which I didn't even know existed. My sister came home and starting yelling to me about how he needs a leash on when he goes outside which she said she told me, but I don't recall. I also didn't have time to find the leash and put it on him when he was on the verge of attacking my daughter.

AITA?

"WIBTA if I get a female roommate after my girlfriend explicitly asked me not to? | Throwaway so I don't doxx myslef. 

I've (22M) been in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend (23F) for a year. We live in the same state a couple hours apart and see each other on weekends. My lease is ending soon and I'm trying to find a roommate as my current roommate is moving for work. I've had both male and female roommates in the past before my girlfriend and I started dating but recently my girlfriend asked me to try and find a male roommate because it would make her more comfortable.

I posted on Craigslist and put up a flyer at my CrossFit box and had a few leads but nothing that panned out until a girl texted me yesterday after seeing my flyer at the gym. We messaged back and forth a but and it seems like we would be good roommates. 

Would I be the asshole if I stop looking for a different (male) roommate - even though I have another month left to look before my lease renewal - and sign a new lease with this girl even though my girlfriend explicitly asked me not to get a female roommate?"
"AITA For Ghosting Mid Date? | So I[27M] matched with this woman[40s F] on tinder and things were going alright. Threw a few jokes and she just replied with, ""tomorrow is my birthday"" and eluded to wanting to hang out. I thought why not, I don't have anything going on. She was going to celebrate with her family on Friday and wanted to meet up for a beer on Saturday.

Fast forward to Saturday she messages me the location of the bar and wants me to come because she's lonely on her birthday. Well as soon as I show up I buy a beer and she wants to leave. I should have seen this as a red flag already because I didn't even really get to know her through one beer. As soon as we get into my car she tells me that we can't go to her place as her son is home with a date and that would be weird. She wants me to pay for a hotel-not even knowing anything but her name and that she has a grown son (yes I know she was older but she had the hole milf thing going on.)

At this point I'm a little taken aback by the forwardness and having to suddenly foot the bill for a hotel room that I don't want to pay for. She changes her mind shortly after I tell her I don't even know her yet and wants to drive 30 minutes away to a bar in a more happening part of town. I'm a little irritated at this point and she starts to say ""it's my birthday!"". As we're driving she starts to tell me how she wants more kids and criticizing me for not having any. Now all that's running through my head is to get her out of my car as fast as I can. So I pull up to a gas station and give her 20 bucks and say that I need a 6 pack for later in the night and I'm gonna pump some gas for the trip to the bar and back. I watch her go in and don't even swipe my card but pretend to start pumping gas. As soon as the coast was clear I put the pump back, got in my car, drove away and unmatched her on tinder so she couldn't contact me.

So am I the asshole here? The gas station I left her at was only a few blocks from the bar we left and there are plenty of rideshares in the area as well."
"AITA for saying I'd rather see a skinny model? | I was next to my sister on the couch and we were looking at the Lululemon website. I was looking at these tight shorts that go a little above your knee and when I selected the inseam and color I wanted, the model was bigger than me. She had large thighs, a big butt, etc. and the website said she was a size 10. I'm usually a size 2 or 4 so I said, ""Honestly, I'd rather see these on a skinnier girl 'cause it's kind of hard to tell what they'll look like one me."" I have chicken legs and a small pancake ass so that's why I said it. My sister got a little angry and started telling me how I should be more accepting, not everyone is thin, how all sizes are beautiful, etc. I was kinda just like wtf because ALL I SAID was that I'd rather see what they look like on a thinner person so I can get a more accurate idea of what they would look like on me. AITA?"
"AITA for saying my friend is not a hero for joining the air force and having guard duty in Texas? | I was telling my friends at a nye party about how I got a new job in Seattle doing finance and supply chain management for amazon. It’s a big deal for me because my current job sucks (procurement for State government)

Alice then goes off and tells me that working for Amazon is pointless that I should have a greater purpose than shipping people boxes of stuff they don’t need. She then talks about how in her life that serving the country was her best decision and she was happy sacrificing pay to do meaningful work.

Now if it was one on one I wouldn’t care but she said this in front of a lot of my friends. So I told her that her job in the air force was guard duty in Texas and data entry. That she didn’t serve the country anymore than I currently do in my state job.

It seemed like I flipped a switch she started cursing me out, saying she could have been called to Iraq. That I have no idea the training she had to do how tough it’s for women. Then saying I am ungrateful for the troops? I don’t think I was an asshole in this at all and I do respect the Troops but the ones that actually see combat not ones that are basically in government jobs."
"AITA for being upset my girlfriend didn’t swipe anything for me from her job when she took loads for herself? | My girlfriend gets a lot of free cosmetic products (creams, makeup, face wash, masks, etc.) due to the nature of her job. She often brings home an item here or there but I guess because it’s the end of the year they were cleaning out everything. 

I came home from doing some Christmas shopping to see two deliveries at the front door. Her mother often sends boxes of fruit for some reason so that’s what I assumed. Her tote bag was on the sofa overflowing with items. She had gone home and changed to meet a friend for dinner, so I took a photo and said “looks like your christmas came early this year” and forgot about it. 

Later she came home and starts to unload the boxes...turns out she got so much free shit that she mailed it from her company to herself because she couldn’t carry it. I’m talking ~2,000$ worth of 50$ creams and makeup and face masks and soaps and sprays etc, enough to last her an eternity. 

I asked if she had swiped anything for me, and she said no, all of it was for her, and anyway, none of the stuff was made specifically for men.

I said hell, I’d like some face cream or a mask, but she said the stuff is hard to get and expensive, so she’ll keep it all for herself so she can save money in the future.

This lead to a big argument based around me calling her selfish because she got so much free shit she had to mail it to herself but couldn’t even think of me enough to grab a single thing for me.

AITA? Or not justified in being angry because it’s a perk of her job and not entitled to anything she gets for free?

EDIT: ok, I get it,  I am TA. What I assumed is a social norm in relationships apparently is not"
"AITA for sending my relative a picture of a bloody corpse? | I know it sounds bad, but bear with me. I have severe health anxiety that I usually manage well. However, I sometimes get extremely anxious after hearing stories of people dying at a young age of some unexpected illness as this is one of my biggest fears. I have a relative (i'll call her E) who pretty much gets off to telling stories about people dying, divorcing etc . Basically anything that she can create drama and be fake-sad over. I asked E multiple times (nicely) to please don't tell me illness-related horror stories because I'll have nightmares and anxiety for weeks after hearing some of them. On Monday we were at a family function and she out of the blue started to tell me a story about a young man in his 30s who died of a heart attack caused by a blood cloth. She also added that the guy worked in the same field I study in and how tragic it is that he died so young and unexpectedly. I got irritated and asked her why it was necessary for her to tell me that . She laughed in my face and called me oversensitive and a crybaby and said that these things are part of life.To which I asked her whether she would be happy if I constantly showed her pictures of car accidents as they are part of life too. She didn't answer and left the room. So after she went home I sent her a picture of a bloody corpse on messenger. She seemed shocked and disgusted and asked me what was that for. I told her that showing her that picture was not different than her telling me in detail about every strange death and illness that happened to people she knew. 

At first I felt satisfied but now I feel a little guilty . So Reddit, AITA?"
"AITA I said my girlfriends grandma should just do the world a favor and die. | So, it sounds really horrible and it is.

Me and my girlfriend planned to visit her grandmother and stay for the weekend. My girlfriend said she had found a stray labrador a few weeks ago and was taking care of it. I was super excited because labs are my favorite and I have had nothing but them since I was a kid. It seemed like a good weekend.

When we get there the grandma immediately yells at my girlfriend because we are a little late due to an unexpected flat. But, she calms down and my girlfriend says she is just grumpy cause we didn't call. Fair enough. I ask to see the dog and this is where it gets bad. The poor thing is locked in the root cellar chained to the wall. Piss and shit is everywhere because it hasn't been out for weeks. She has just been tossing it chunks of meat. I immediately get pissed off because this is neglect. My girlfriend tries to calm me saying she is old and from a different time. I am just like ""whatever I am getting it out now""

Poor thing is so excited to have human contact it just can't sit still. I rush it up to the bathroom to wash it off and grandma is just yelling about how it got everything covered in shit and piss. She keeps screaming at us to get it out of the bathroom because it is dirty. I really want to go slap her but my girlfriend keeps excusing her and I have a dig to clean.

I keep it in our guest room and it is just the sweetest thing. Super friendly and amicable. So we leave it in the room because we have nothing for and we run to the store to buy food, collar, leash, bedding, etc. We get a call from grandma screaming that it has torn up everything. I just say I will pay for any damage just leave it.

We get back and dog is gone. The only sign of damage is a pair of my girlfriends jeans being slightly chewed. We go back in the cellar to find the dog again. Back in the shit and piss crying for help. She won't let it stay in the rest of her house anymore with how dirty and destructive it is. I say fine and leave with the dog.

My girlfriend is trying to calm me as I rage away with the dog and says she has just always been like that and not to judge her. And I am just so angry that I yell, ""The world will be better when she dies. It is a crime to treat an animal like this.""

My girlfriend is in tears because she loves her grandma despite how abusive she is to her and animals. And I just honestly can't change my opinion. That was horrible animal abuse and I am disgusted by her. But, my girlfriend is just trying to keep peace and doesn't want me to hate her family. She keeps saying all this stuff to make things better but I just won't hear it. Too enraged.

TLDR grandma keeps dog in cellar for weeks, I lose my shit and say her death is the worlds gain. AITA?"
"AITA for telling my wife that her interpretation of “no ovaries no opinion” is ridiculous? | Throwaway because my family knows my main account

So my wife is currently pregnant with our first child, and I have been really excited and anxious about the whole process. She just entered her third trimester pretty recently, so we have been making all the necessary preparations for the baby. For example, the nursery is basically almost done, we have a lot of baby clothes, and all of that stuff.

We have also been discussing after birth plans. The first issue is when I brought up how our baby was going to be fed. I brought up breastfeeding because I’ve read lots of mommy blogs and articles about the benefits of breastfeeding and I thought that it would be a great thing for my wife to do. When I brought it up (I didn’t even get to bring up my points and research) she cut me off and said that she didn’t want to breastfeed. When I tried to intervene and explain my reasoning she just said “no ovaries no opinion” and that was basically the end of it.

I also asked her if she wanted to do skin to skin contact right after birth because I’ve heard some amazing things about it. As usual, she cut me off before I could explain it and said that she didn’t want to do it and I couldn’t change her mind because she’s the one that’s going to be in labor.

The straw that really broke the camel’s back was when I asked her about eating the placenta. She had planned on doing it, and I didn’t really mind, but I was talking to a coworker about it and she mentioned how she didn’t do it because of the negative effects. I looked it up myself and saw some things I thought were concerning, and I just wanted to tell my wife about them just in case she didn’t know. I couldn’t even get more than a couple of words out before she blew up on me and kind of firmly told me to “stop trying to make all of the decisions for the pregnancy” which is what I wasn’t trying to do. She told me that I’m not the one that has to carry the baby around for 9 months and has to physically go through the birth so I should keep my opinions to myself, and she basically said that since I have no ovaries and opinions. I got upset and told her that I felt like she was trying to exclude me from all of the decisions for OUR child because she won’t even listen to me by telling me “no ovaries no opinion” so I can’t get any words out, and it was starting to get ridiculous. She got upset and now she’s not talking to me. I’m going to try to fix this, but was I TA here for just trying to have some conversations about how our child was going to be raised and my wife’s health?"
"AITA for taking a kid’s food away? | About a month ago, I met my boyfriend’s son. Since he travels for work for most of the year, he wants his son’s time with him to be enjoyable so he lets him get away with a lot without disciplining him. He fears his son will not want to see him every weekend if he’s too tough on him, so he lets him get away with a lot. His son is 10 and demands that his dad buys him things, doesn’t say thank you, steals money from his wallet and laughs about it, jokingly says things to his dad like “stop it or I’ll kill you”, etc.

Since I’ve met this kid, I have gone out of my way for him frequently because it’s obvious to me from his behavior that he’s neglected at his mom’s house. I’ve cooked all of his meals, taken him to places, and even tried to help him with his math. Every weekend that he comes over, he always acts out either by saying something inappropriate, not listening, or getting an attitude when he doesn’t get his way. His dad hasn’t disciplined him, and instead has appeased him every time. 

Yesterday, I thought it would be a good idea to take him to a festival that has live music, food trucks and art from local artists. Once we’re in the car, he’s asking where we’re going and I’m telling him it’s a surprise. He starts asking over and over again where we’re going until we get out of the car, starts pouting and gets an attitude because I told him to wait and see. His dad told him as we’re walking up, but he maintained the attitude towards me for a half hour until he decided he wanted ice cream. So we’re walking around and about every 5 minutes he asks to leave to go to the bookstore. He ends up enjoying himself, but maintains when asked that he didn’t have any fun and that he’d rather be home watching tv.

Once we get home, my boyfriend and I start cooking dinner and get him involved. He gets an attitude at first but ends up enjoying himself. By this time, I’d already expressed to my boyfriend that I was at my limit with the smack talking and attitudes. He didn’t address it and gave his son tasks to keep him involved. He continues to act out by putting half of a watermelon shell on his head and running around to the front of the house to ring the doorbell nonstop. 

As we’re eating, he’s talking smack and still acting out. I tell him that it’s free to be kind, follow directions and that not doing these things will cost him, as I don’t do nice things for kids that don’t deserve them. He gets an attitude and says he doesn’t care if I do nice things for him. His dad tries to change the subject by asking him how he likes his dinner, and he responds “it’s good, but it would be better if NotYourMomDude let me cut the onions smaller”. I told him since he doesn’t like the food he’s done eating and took his plate away. He said “fine, I didn’t want to eat it anyway”, and marches to the couch. I left but apparently he cried when I left saying he didn’t know why I took his plate away. His dad thinks I overreacted. 

AITA?

Edit: A lot of you are saying that taking his food away could cause problems with body image and possibly create an eating disorder down the road. I should add that his plate was almost completely cleared. He’d also already had a cheeseburger, popsicle, and a ton of watermelon within 4 hours of this. He’s well fed, but he’s not being abused in the slightest."
"AITA for not wanting my wife's best friend to come to our house anymore | Names are changed, just in case.

Last night my wife and I had her best friend, Jack, over for New Years. I got off work before my wife so Jack came over and hung out for a bit before my wife got home.

Jack and I have known eachother for about a decade and my wife's known him for two or more.

Jack is a pretty flamboyant guy, and when him and I are one-on-one he's never rude or abrasive, we get along great. But when my wife's hanging out with them the two of them get kind of catty and talk a lot of shit. I don't really like it but I've never been the target of their cattiness before.

But last night, Jack laid into me a bit. The man sat on my couch, eating the food I paid for, and called me a ""fucking idiot"" twice.

The second time I just froze, looked him over, then excused myself, kissed my wife goodnight and went to bed. I didn't want to ruin her night with her friend.

This morning I called him and told him he isn't welcome in my home anymore. I discussed it with my wife beforehand and she says she understands but she usually won't say anything to me right away if she disagrees because when I'm upset about something I'm usually pretty stubborn.

I'm not really upset about it, I just don't want to be shit on in my own home.

What do you guys think, AITA?



TLDR - Wife's best friend called me a fucking idiot twice while he was over for New Years and I don't want him back in my house."
"AITA for telling my cousin why he can’t find a good woman. | He went on a date with a girl who didn’t want a second date a while ago. She married a friend of ours and it’s kind of sent my cousin into a depression and he keeps whining and will talk of little else except about how unfair it is that he can’t find a good woman. 

He thinks having money means beautiful, educated, kind women should be throwing themselves at his feet and complains only stupid, unattractive women or gold diggers pay him attention and that’s unfair, etc. He keeps demanding “explanations” and “reasons” and refuses to be comforted by our family’s platitudes or whatever. 

I know they’re rhetorical demands and he isn’t interested in anything that assigns responsibility to his faults but I lost my temper when we were at another cousin’s bachelor party and he would not stop whining. I said if all he has to offer women is money why would he expect anything other than a woman who wants money? 

We were drinking and argued messily. I wasn’t nice but I wasn’t dishonest. I didn’t really do it to help him bc I didn’t feel like he would listen, it was just really satisfying, does that make me an asshole?

People are telling me I should apologize for telling him he’s trashy, unkind, and boring. But his only hobby is online shopping and he spends actual time cyber bulling his 12 year old nephew so I think it is truthful to say someone empathetic and accomplished would have little interest in him. The proof is in the pudding. If a dude with family wealth can’t find a good woman it ain’t the money’s fault... that’s practically dating on easy mode so the problem has to be his personality.

I don’t really feel ashamed of giving a stupid question it’s honest answer. I know family needs family to be supportive and patient out of anyone but I feel like this situation is just self-inflicted suffering and he can choose that but I don’t gotta. My family is a little old school “blood is thicker” and all about accepting people as they are and having their back no matter what, giving them room to not be their best selves but I feel like there’s gotta be a line and I guess the constant whining is mine. So... am I being too harsh to not apologize to a cousin?"
"AITA for thinking a monthly girls night is too much? | I have 4 friends that I’ve known since 3rd grade. The 4 of us have always been best friends. We’re in our 20s now.


Recently “Lilly” has been arranging for us to do a girls night once a month. AITA for thinking this is too much and not wanting it to be “only girls”? Hear me out...


My boyfriend is VP of a small company, I work in a hospital. My boyfriend also has 2 kids that are with him 4 days a week, every other week. Fri-Sun and again on Tuesdays. Saturday’s are usually the only day we both have off work but occasionally one of us has to work. 


I always feel like we don’t get enough quality time as it is so I really look forward to the maybe one day of the month we both have off. But then Lilly comes in and wants to use that one day a month for girls night. And it’s not like girls night is late, we usually go to dinner around 5 then Lilly wants to go out after(the others sometimes do, sometimes don’t). Even worse, she’s sometimes tries to plan a “girls only brunch”.


I’d be ok doing these girls nights maybe once every 3 months but not once every month. I’m also cool with hanging out as a group if our boyfriends are invited but Lilly is the only single one so we feel bad inviting them. 


WIBTA if I just declined these invites and only accept once every 3 months instead of every month?



Edit: I took the advice of reddit(why?!) and it ended up with Lilly crying and our whole dinner was awkward and terrible. Thanks for all the help guys 🙃"
"WIBTA If I told the church fundraiser to make things right? | Hey guys, I have a dilemma and I need to know if I would be the asshole if I expected the church to make things right.

Last night I was at a church fundraiser event. One of these parties where everyone pays there way in ($100 per couple) and is assigned a number. They call out numbers all night long and the last number called wins $10,000. We didn’t win that and Im fine with that.

In addition to that though, they had a bunch of these raffle baskets. You spend $20, get 20 raffle tickets and you can put it in for any prize you want, and if your number gets called, you win that prize.

They had stuff like tickets to a New York Rangers Game,  a Keurig, a TV, a printer, etc. All stuff thats really cool and interesting and would have put in for, but my favorite thing they had there, was a Pilot Script signed by the cast of Friends the TV Show. Im a autograph collector and wanted that more than anything else. The script was in a closed glass casing so I could not really examine it closely, but I did ask the staff if it was authentic autographs and they told me yes. So i bought $40 worth of tickets and put them all in the friends basket. It was one of the biggest items there. 

The raffle comes, and I won and Im so happy to add this to my collection. I go home and take it out of the casing, and to my surprise it turns out to be a reprint. (Basically they all signed one and they made a million photocopies of it). On the back of the script it had a card with the link of the website where they purchased it from. Sure enough they only spent $25 on it. But they were advertising this as the real thing.

I feel like they owe me actual autographs from the cast from a reputable source. I feel like I did my part by asking the staff before hand if the autographs were real before I put any tickets in. This was something (if i wanted too) i could have printed out with my own computer and printer!

I have not said anything yet to the staff and Im feeling conflicted about it. But had anyone knew it was a fake, nobody would have put tickets into it.

What do i do?"
"AITA for not wanting to participate in mourning my boss? | AITA for not wanting to participate in mourning my boss?

Technically she wasn't my immediate boss but she was my bosses boss. She was only like 50 but had a stroke at home and fell down the stairs. She broke her spine, neck, was in a coma and was on life support for 2 days before they pulled the plug and she died. 

This death, like most, was sudden and unexpected and people at my job started wearing black ribbons on their uniforms. A coworker saw that I did not have one on mine and offered me one, to which I replied ""no thanks"" and received a few glares from other coworkers in the area. I caved a few minutes later and ended up putting the ribbon on.

I didn't have much interaction with my bosses boss, but when I did she was a real bitch. She truly was a horrible person. A week before she passed away I heard her talking to my immediate boss about a coworker who was out sick because she had a miscarriage. And this woman had the nerve to say ""Shit happens, but she still needs to come to work.""

Anyway, I don't wish death upon anyone and I'm not glad she died, but I'm not going to pretend like she was a terrific person. AITA here?"
"AITA for eating a lot at a wedding buffet? | I (17M) eat a good amount of food. Based on my body type and physical activity, I've been eating well over 4,000 calories a day to maintain my current weight.

My aunt got married last weekend in a venue close to my parents' house. It was originally scheduled for the morning, but problems with catering and the venue/DJ meant that they rescheduled it for that evening at the last minute.

This was problematic because I needed to attend my afternoon swim practice that day, as I had only been excused for the morning one. I ended up going to both practices, had to change into my tux right outside the weight room, and drove directly there. I only ate a protein bar during the drive, so I was thrilled to find a well-stocked buffet after the reception.

I loaded my plate, then went back for seconds. I was going to get a third round when my mom pulled me aside. She had been giving me weird looks during the meal, and told me to cut it out, and that if I was still hungry I could make something when we got home.

Now, I would have ordinarily agreed with her, but when we helped chip in for the wedding, we paid for two meals instead of one for me. I ate a good amount, but I doubt it was more than double whatever everyone else was eating.

She eventually gave in and let me get a third serving. I would have eaten more, but she put her foot down. There was still some extra food left once the meal service ended.

Once we left, my mom went on a rant about how I was ""making aunt and her fiancee fund my cheat day."" I told her that it was the guests paying for the catering, not them, and I wasn't depriving anyone else since I went back for more once most people were done.

I'm not sure if I violated some social norm, but I feel like I was justified. AITA, Reddit?

EDIT: I don't know if this matters, but I was mainly eating chicken and lamb, not veggies or rice/bread. There was still some leftover, though."
"AITA for ditching my friend to meet his Japanese fling's parents without a translator | I spent the last year studying in Japan and whilst not fluent, have picked up some Japanese. To say goodbye I'm touring Japan with a couple friends from home. Bob has pretty good vocab from anime, but Mike knows like 100 words. Neither of them know any grammar so I often need to translate for them.

Mike is an absolute hit with the ladies here. It's hard to convey just how attractive he's considered.  One girl became particularly enamoured meeting him, and invited us (through Mike) to stay at her parents beach house. Mike loves the beach, and it's free accommodation, so I was warm to the idea, imagining she'd bring a couple friends and we'd have fun drinking together. I also assumed, perhaps unjustifiably, that her parents wouldn't actually be there.

I was wrong. I found out yesterday in the house would be her, her parents, and the three of us. I immediately lost all impetus to go. The third wheeling, the inevitable awkward interactions with her parents, and the fact that I didn't really fancy going to a beach. I thought this wouldn't be a big deal because we've already split up a couple times.

I tell Mike, but he said that I had to come or it would be too awkward. I told him that's his issue. He got a tad angry but it was dropped and we went out drinking.

The next morning, he woke us up and I reconfirm I'm not going. I told him if he was serious and made a heartfelt plea I'd go, but he just kept repeating the same reasons from earlier progressively getting angrier, before storming off to shower. This was perhaps unfair because he's terrible at communicating emotions, but the fact that he could only get angry firmed my resolve.

I talked with Bob, and said he was welcome to come with me, go with Mike, or solo adventure. He said he still wanted to go. Bob's a super laid back guy so it's hard to figure out what he's actually feeling at some times, and whether he actually wanted to go or felt pressured to, or if he though I was being a twat. 

So, AITA? I did, pretty heavily imply I would go, and I have left my mates on a sticky wicket with three random Japanese people and minimal ways to communicate, however, I did make those implications under different circumstances, and frankly it's not my monkeys and it's not my circus. I don't feel obliged to translate for him so he can have less awkward time getting laid, especially at the expense of two days of the trip. Admittedly, however, awkward interactions are much more enjoyable in groups, so even if it wasn't as a translator, just my presence would probably have been a nice thing to have, and as a friend, maybe I should have stayed for his sake. I can definitely see why he thinks I'm being a bad friend ditching him last minute, but I also don't think it's ridiculous to not want to go given the situation.

As an aside, Mike is the twat who wouldn't share his umbrella from like two weeks ago, but I'm over that. Probably."
"AITA for being bitter with my parents over not paying for my wedding? | Mobile post, throw away because this could make my main identifiable.

&#x200B;

Little background: middle child, only girl. I've never been completely sure where I stand with my parents. There are moments I feel loved, and then others (most the time) I feel like the Meg of my family.  A quick example is that my birthday has been forgotten more than once, even though there's only a day between my dads (who's is first) and mine.

&#x200B;

When I was young I vocalized my want to remain unmarried for my life, my mother would give me shit saying I would change my mind. Despite my protests, surprise, she was right. I found the perfect for me guy and got engaged in 2016. I wasn't rushing to the alter because, well, money. I've never had a chance to have a big party for any reason, and won't ever again as I can't have kids and this is a one and done type deal with marriage for me.

&#x200B;

About a 2 years ago, my mother inquired about paying for the wedding because it was taking us so long to get married. I declined, in my mind I was planning on figuring out, saving, and paying for my dream wedding. She wouldn't drop it, and somehow(???) made me feel guilty for rejecting such a heartfelt offer. She also made sure to remind me my grandpa died while I was engaged and my grandma wanted to see us get . So we made a deal that we would both put money into a wedding account to help pay for it. My mom puts it in from her end, and I'll send her money to put into the account.

&#x200B;

Here's where the bitterness has slowly been growing and it gets a bit convoluted. Since the time we made the agreement I've spent 3k+ from my own account because she takes a while to transfer, they've only put $300 in the account total. My parents started a new business within 6 months of the agreement to help pay for the wedding.  My parents have been collecting at least half my paycheck since I was 14 (EDIT: Started at 114 and continued until I moved out,) but my mother regularly drops money into my little brothers bank account so he can buy clothes/go out. He's not made to keep a job like I was (see? I'm a resentful asshole.)

&#x200B;

I would be fine with the situation if I could work, but I can't currently. I was ""laid off"" while on FMLA and am trying to get diagnosed so I can go back to work and be healthy.  But I can't deny that I'm holding a lot of resentment for my parents currently. I'm their only daughter. Why would you offer to even help if you can't? I was fine before the offer, but now I'm feeling stressed about my health and the wedding. I'll never in a million years tell my parents I feel this way, but it doesn't change that I do. And I feel like a total sack of slimy runny baby poo for feeling this way at all.

&#x200B;

I just need to know AITA for feeling this way?"
"AITA for asking for less free cookies? | My sister works at a bakery, and one of the perks is bringing home leftovers. She brings home wayyyy more than necessary, and so I always indulge. This happens close to twice per week.

It’s really not good because I am watching my weight. I have completely lost my self control re: depression. I also know how expensive these cookies are at the bakery, so I feel like I’m getting a deal every time I eat a free one.

AITA for asking her to bring less cookies home or asking her to bring bags with my other family member’s names written on them instead? I think the latter would help her realize that she’s bringing too many."
"WIBTA if I (25 f) go on a trip with my male best friend (25m) even though my boyfriend (25 m) doesn't want me to? | Me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 years. We're in a happy relationship so I've never thought this would ever be a problem.

For a few years my male best friend and I always wanted to go to Amsterdam to explore the city and smoke some weed. But we never had the money as we were poor students. We've known eachother for almost 10 years now and now that we finally have a job, we can finally afford it. So I told my boyfriend about my plans. I even invited him on the trip, but he declined. I thought: okay, then we'll just go alone. A few days later he told me that he wasn't comfortable with me travelling alone with my best friend. He also said that if it was a girl, he wouldn't have problems with it. I don't understand as there is absolutely nothing more than friendship between us. There never was something between us and never will. My best friend agrees. And I really would like to go travelling with him. 

Some discussions later, he said that I can go,that he can't stop me, but that he really doesn't feel comfortable. It's not like we are going to sleep in the same bed. It's even going to be 2 separate rooms and he is still not okay with this. I feel a bit torn, but I would still like to go. So would I be the asshole if I go even though I know he doesn't like it?

edit: I'm from Europe and it's only gonna be a weekend trip. I'm not even planning on partying. It's really just getting high and exploring the city."
"AITA for not giving my overweight son a donut? | I came home from work last night and stopped by the gas station to grab a soda. I got me and my wife two donuts but I didnt get one for my son because he's on a low-sugar/carb diet because he is overweight. My son was asleep when I came home so I didn't think he would know. But he saw the donut wrappers in the trash the next morning and was very upset. Am I the asshole dad?

Edit: grammar"
"AITA For telling a woman she cannot save seats on an airplane? | This happened last week coming home from the holidays. So Southwest has a seating procedure where you get called in groups rather than seat reservations. My wife and I were towards the end of the line because most people boarding had kids so they have priority. Once we finally get on the plane, I head to the back where I see two rows of empty seats so my wife and I could sit next to each other.

I start to sit in the first row and a lady says, ""that row of seats is reserved""! I shrugged it off because there was one more row so I head for that row. Again, she says, ""that row is also reserved""! I replied, ""for who""? She says, ""the rest of my family who couldn't board with us because they didn't have kids."" I look at the flight attendant and exclaimed that I was unaware that's how Southwest's boarding procedure works (because it doesn't). The flight attendant looked uneasy and didn't say anything and walked back behind the galley where the snacks were.

I told the lady that she cannot save seats and that people were stacking up behind me trying to sit down. I was going to continue to argue with the lady until my wife said it's fine and grabbed a middle seat between two people. Since she already sat down, I went ahead and grabbed another middle seat further up the plane, forcing other people to also back up and find randomly available seats. AITA for thinking she was in the wrong for saving seats and splitting up my wife and I?

Edit: Thanks everyone. Many of you suggested, so I went ahead and contacted Southwest via email with the whole story. Hopefully I hear back from them with an apology at the very least. Cheers

Edit 2: Well guys I got my reply from Southwest. Apparently they have no policy about saving seats, even if it's two rows. Also, no mention about the flight attendant so I guess what she did was okay in Southwest's book. I guess in the end I'm the AH! Here's the email [http://imgur.com/a/EV7KaMA](http://imgur.com/a/EV7KaMA)"
"AITA for cooking food my roommate is allergic to? | My roommate has a shellfish allergy and I do sometimes cook shrimp with my meals. Now I always clean up my mess. Dishes are washed immediately after cooking, and I wipe down the counters with clorox wipes to make sure there are no contaminants. 

My roommate still complains when I do, though she has made it clear that she is in no danger of an allergic reaction as long as I do clean up after myself. Should I just stop cooking shrimp entirely? I try not to cook when she's in the apartment so she doesn't have to smell it but I feel kind of bad. She won't say **why** she doesn't want me cooking shrimp, just that I should stop. I am very careful when I do cook, I make sure of that, and I'd feel awful if I accidentally triggered an allergic reaction. 

I also take her allergies into consideration when I cook for the whole apartment, I would never purposefully cook something that not everyone could eat if I am indeed cooking for everyone. 

So am an asshole for continuing to cook shrimp? Should I stop?"
"AITA for letting a strictly vegan child eat whatever they want at daycare? | At the daycare I work for we have this system of free snacks. Basically the kids can eat whatever they want whenever they want. They have free access to the trays of food whenever. I think it’s stupid and it has caused so many problems for me. 

One of these problems is we have a very religious vegan family who has a 4 year old who’s in my room. Every morning when the food is brought out I will take him to the food and show him what’s vegan and what’s not. He will nod and say yep ok. And then 10 minutes later I will catch him with all of the cheese cubes stuffed in his mouth. He will literally stuff himself with so much non vegan food, that sometimes he vomits.

His mum comes to pick him up and EVERYDAY will claim she can smell that he ate non vegan food and yell at me. It’s not my fault this kid doesn’t listen, the food is free access and I can’t stop him from eating whatever I want. The mum says I should be monitoring the food trays so that this kid and kids with allergies (which is a whole other story, who the hell puts chocolate coated peanuts on a tray where kids with deathly peanut allergies have free access to !!!!!) don’t eat foods their not meant to

AITA for not monitoring this kid and what he eats more closely?"
"AITA For getting pissed at my dinner guests? | To set the stage, I pesonally put in over 6 hours to create sous vide lemon pepper chicken. Make handmade mashed potatoes, and greenbeans. As a professional chef, I usually dont care if people lather their food with condoments, its not in my face, and i couldnt care less. But this time i invited a select group of friends over to eat. I was shocked to see these people rummage through my fridge, pull out ketchup and drown their chicken in ketchup! My beautiful chicken was mercilessly ruined in front of me. I feel personally insulted.they didnt try it, or anything. They then proceeded to eat said chicken and remark the entire time about how good it was. 

TL;DR houseguests poured ketchup on a feast that i prepared"
"AITA for wanting to talk about something that stresses my wife out? | My wife is joining the army, but her first meps failed because of the duck walk. She handled everything else perfectly, and did great on the asvab.

 She's really stressed about going back to do it. I keep trying to practice with her, and talk her through it, but she says bringing it up puts more pressure on her. She feels like all of the pressure is on her, and feels like she can't do it.

I feel like we need to talk about it, and work on it together. I was in the Airforce. I keep mentioning that there's a waiver for it. Everytime I mention anything about it she gets angry with me, and is moved to the point of tears. She is very passionate about joining. I truly believe that she can do it, and that I can help her. I keep bringing it up after she asked me not to because she is still struggling with it. Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for telling my fiancé to move in with me, or to stop complaining? | My fiancé lives with his parents and I live with mine. Until we're both a bit more financially secure we won't be getting our own place. Every day fiancé complains about his parents and brothers to me- they're controlling him, insulting me, taking his money without asking etc. My first suggestion was talk it out with them but he didn't want to do that so I said why not just move in with me and my mum and he said no that too. I've had very little patience with his complaints since then because I gave him to suggestions to try to make his situation better but it seems like he's just using it as an excuse to complain without actually doing anything. So I told him he can either move in with me or just shut up about his family. He's not talked to me since. AITA?"
"AITA for not telling my boyfriend that I found an engagement ring | So, about a week ago, I(21M) was looking for something in closet. Me and my boyfriend(25M) share a closet so he keeps his stuff there too. I moved something and box dropped on a ground. I opened it when I picked it up, it was an engagement ring. I put it back exactly where it was and didn’t tell my boyfriend anything about it. 

I told my best friend few days ago and he says that I should just tell him and it’d be an asshole move to act surprised when he proposes and lie to him like that."
"WIBTA for refusing to pay for my friend's D&D campaign? | Okay, this is minor, but it might start shit so I want to make sure I'm not a total anus before going ahead.

My friend runs a D&D game for us. She worked really hard on it and makes all kinda of extra materials for us- extra side plots, newspaper clippings, really going all out. Recently the game's hit a bit of a rut plot wise and it's been a struggle to continue it since I'm not having a good time. I don't want to just quit since we have had a lot of fun in the past and I'm hoping we can get out of this hole and have fun again.

However, beside this, the DM has been a bit demanding, she's been badgering us to keep a log of everything we do in the plot, which is fair enough but feels a bit like having to do homework for something we enjoy. She's also insisting we put together a playlist of music for the game, and other bits and pieces. Again, she puts in a lot of work for the game so I do get why she asks us to chip in, but it's feeling a bit much since none of the players asked for any of this.

The last straw has been that recently, she has been asking us to pay the equivalent of 2 dollars per session to cover printing costs. The printing costs are mostly for the extra stuff she makes, which is cool, but none of us ask for this and it's usually not plot-relevant. Even if it was, we all bring snacks and drinks the the game so it's not like we aren't contributing.

Basically, right now it feels like I'm paying for the privileged of being bored, and being assigned homework on top of that. Again, quitting the game isn't something I want to do just yet, but I want to draw the line at forking out cash. 

I'm feeling bad since this is the DM's first game (she's a lot younger than me) and she's clearly putting in a ton of her own time and money, but I think that's her choice and we shouldn't have feel pressured to help her out?

AITA if I keep my 2 dollars?"
"AITA for calling out some girls at BJJ for fetishizing my friend? | Well, I say ""friend"" but really he (21M) is more of an acquaintance.

So I (23M) practice BJJ and am a Blue Belt. I know 3 other girls there (all same age as me) that are also blue belt. 

Now this white belt newbie is 21M. No homo, but he's *very* good looking. He's quite skinny for his frame (looks to be about 150lbs at 6""2), but his face is like a greek god or something. He just that that look. 

Now I know I might sound jealous here, but I'm not. Well I noticed that the girls were going easy on him. Fair play, he's a white belt. But I noticed that they weren't trying *once*, which I found strange.

Well I thought nothing of it until we went on a night out. The acquaintance (21M) was there too. 

So acquaintance went off to talk to some other girls and the 3 girls are drunk, they just start talking about how hot he is and all of them then start saying how they ""love it"" when he chokes them in BJJ. I almost spat my drank out! Then one of them, we'll call her Lucy, just starts saying how she basically lets him win but wishes she could be pinned by him forever, and basically said she doesn't try against him because she likes losing *to him*. 

Now it all made sense, why they go harder on other white belts but not him. All 3 of them were going for this guy. 

I called them out and said ""don't you think it's a bit creepy and detrimental to his training to fetishize him like that?"", then Lucy got awkward and said I shouldn't be a ""jealous asshole"", and the other two agreed. Idk now. AITA?"
"WIBTA for wanting to give an Airbnb a low rating even though the stay was nice? | My friends and I booked an Airbnb. The unit is 3 bedrooms and there are 3 people in our group. After I booked it I saw that I was charged an extra guest fee, which puzzled me as it was a three bedroom place. 

I messaged the host to verify why we received this fee and she initially told me that we were incorrectly charged the fee and that I should contact Airbnb support to get the necessary refund. I contact Airbnb and I am told that only the host can initiate a refund, so I go back to the host and tell her this. She replies and says that she has absolutely no ability to refund me and that I need to just talk to Airbnb. She also proceeds to let me know that she is currently fighting an infection in the hospital so she doesn’t have the time to talk now. 

As soon as she said this, I told her to rest up and that we can continue this convo when she is well. However, she proceeded to repeatedly message me at that moment to reiterate that only Airbnb can issue a refund for me (which clearly was wrong). At that point I’m simply telling her that we can pick this up later. 

A few days after the fact, she messages me and apologizes for our first exchange. She also lets me know that the extra guest fee was correctly applied to our bill, as the listing indicates that it is applied after 2 guests. The host reiterated that she simply was not well enough to answer my question at the time I messaged her. In my mind I’m thinking “Then why did you respond?”

All in all, the Airbnb was great, but I still want to give her a low score (particularly in the Communication category) for misinforming me, asking me not to bother her, and then messaging me only to tell me that I’m incorrect. For me the issue isn’t the extra fee, it’s how she went about handling the situation. I felt very uncomfortable for simply asking a question about our bill."
"AITA for wanting to set up a spot for my deceased dead at our wedding but not my fiancé’s deceased family members? | So first things first. I love my fiancé with all my heart. She has been nothing but perfect with me dealing with the loss of my dad when I was 19. I cannot wait until we say “I do”.

So we’ve been planning our wedding & we were setting up the seats & I had a spot reserved for my dad right next to me. She notices and says, “Oh that’s sweet” then proceeds to say that she wants to do the same for her 2 grandmothers (one who died before she was born & the other one didn’t approve of our relationship cause we’re interracial). So I say pretty much that it doesn’t seem special if we’re going to do it for every single family member that has passed. I 100% see where she’s coming from but also a reason I wanted to is cause my dad & I were very very very close. I lost him when he was only 48. But pretty much since then her parents have been treating me like an asshole. 

So reddit, AITA? I know she’s not being an asshole."
"AITA for going on a trip to a wedding and leaving my mother alone? | Long time lurker, recently joined.

My dad died a few years back and my mom had no friends or family nearby, so I [25F] and my then-boyfriend now-husband [30M] moved in with her from a few states away. So I live with my husband and mom. Mostly we all love each other, but sometimes my husband feels like I choose my mom over him because my mom can be very needy and gets lonely easily, and we have had several fights over it.

We have two cats also, that go in a very large kennel at night because they are also very needy and will wake you up every five minutes to be petted. My husband usually rounds them up and gets them in there.

We're going on a 6 day trip in a day because my husband's sister is getting married a couple of states away, and up until now my mom has said that she has felt okay putting the cats to bed by herself for the days we'll be gone. But tonight she suddenly threw a huge fit, saying that she doesn't know if she can do it and she's insulted we didn't think of her.

I told her I can board the cats in a local kennel, but she says that's unacceptable and will traumatize them. My only other option then would be to stay home and take care of them.

I told my husband this, and he said that if I do not go on this trip with him, our almost 3 year marriage is essentially over as it will show him I put her first always. 

I'm dying here, Reddit. AITA for boarding the cats anyway, leaving my mom alone, and choosing my marriage?

Edit: fixed my wording."
"AITA? Coworker refused to tell me her name. I got kind of defensive. | Started a new job. Was in the break room. Met one of my coworkers for the first time. We talked a little bit, was fine. She asked me my name so I told her, then I asked what her's was and she curtly said ""I'm not going to tell you that."" I was like ""That's kind of weird but alright."" And she said if I wanted to find out I could look at the board that said the 2 employees of the month and that hers was one of the names, to which I pretty frankly said ""I don't really give a shit what your name is enough to put in that effort, I'll just find out from someone else"" and then I just disengaged.

I kind of cringe looking back. She was probably just messing around but I mean... I just met you and you're being alienating like that? I don't know if that is just her style of fooling around and she wasn't trying to be a dick but at that point I felt slighted. :/

"AITA for waiting until after the holidays to break the bad news to my staff? | I run a branch of a small business that has operations in 18 locations. I was made aware last week that due to a lack of revenue and support from our host campus that our locations’ operation will likely be shutting down in March. I have not yet told my staff of 3 part time college students and one full time employee that come March 2020 they will be out of work. There is a remote chance that the campus could subsidize the operation or a major sponsor could materialize and the program would continue but I don’t see it happening. AITA for waiting until after the holiday to tell my staff they need to start looking for work and they will be unemployed come March?

Update: All staff members still have jobs and have been told of the situation.  Thank you for everyone’s input."
"AITA for calling my wife overprotective | So the issue here is my son, who is 7 wanted to walk to school with his friends in the snow in the morning the week before Christmas. His friends all walk to school together, and he’s perfectly capable of waking up earlier to get there on time.

My wife thinks it’s too dangerous. She doesn’t want him to. They don’t walk on any main roads to get to school, and we live in a good suburban neighborhood. We’ve been fighting about it for the last few days. It came to a head today, when she was basically saying that she vetoes him walking without a parent. I said that when I was 5 to the end of high school, I walked to school with my friend group every day, rain or shine, and didn’t get kidnapped or hit by a car, and she’s just being overprotective. She basically shut down and called me an asshole.

AITA?"
"AITA for keeping my cats at night when my SO has asked me to close the door due to disrupted sleep? | My boyfriend and I have only been together a little over 3 months. Things have been going well, we had some misunderstandings but overall we're both happy! The thing is, my cats have always been extremely important to me and they have been here far longer than he has. I dont feel like I should stop what I've always been doing, especially when it would both distress me and my cats (They are very dependent on me so it's definitely not ""just cats"".) I gave in to his demand the other night, and I say demand because he got mad at me when I tried to keep them with us, as in actually scolding me and threatening to go sleep at his place. I wasn't happy but I was tired so I just went to bed after cuddling them and closing the door.  


The next day I talked to him about it and I told him, next time if he wants to sleep properly he will have to use the guest bedroom so that way, I get to sleep with my cats and everyone is happy! It's not like we share my bed anyway, its way too small and he already has to bring one into my room.  


Some people would say that relationships require sacrifices, and I do make them. But this isn't something I feel I should have to compromise at all when it's my home, my pets. I'm extremely fond of animals whereas he's like ""Meh. It's a cat/dog"". He has tried to say I don't take good care of him only because of this one thing I refuse to do, and has also admitted to being jealous of the attention I give my cats. It's true that I spend more time with them than the average person, but I'm no crazy cat lady either. They're part of my life and I think he should respect that.  


So, am I being the asshole here?"
"AITA for wanting my boyfriend to stop sleeping naked? | To start off I (f27) would like to say that I don’t think my boyfriend (m30) is being an asshole per se, just stubborn in this regard. I also want to be clear about the fact that I have zero issues with nudity in general. What people want to wear or not wear in the comfort of their own home is solely up to them.

Look, I get it it. It’s summer. It’s ridiculously hot. AC is not common where we live, and fans do little to alleviate the problem. Especially at night, when the sun has been beaming and heating our apartment up to oven like temperatures all day. It makes relaxing and sleeping uncomfortable as hell. I get all of this, I really do and I’m sympathetic to the problem. The kicker is we live in a relatively small apartment with our 3 year old son (let’s call him Kyle). Kyle has his own bedroom to make room for his toys and what not, and we have the living room split with a divider to create a bedroom for us. This room doesn’t have a door since it’s not technically a bedroom, but we make it work since it’s quite a large room with enough space for both needs. 

Now for as long as I’ve know him, my boyfriend has always slept naked. I have too, sometimes I wear a T-shirt or something else to bed but most of the time I’ve slept in the nude as well. But lately I’ve started to think that since our son is getting older and more understanding of body parts and what should and shouldn’t be on display that we should act as role models here and start wearing clothes to bed. 

My main issue is that although it’s not often, every now and then Kyle will wake up in the middle of the night and come into our room and we’ll just put him in bed with us. And more often than not he wakes up earlier than us (or any alarm for that matter) and is the one that comes in and wakes us up in the morning.  

I’m starting to feel that sleeping naked is inappropriate at this point and we should start dressing for bed. I’m not saying it has to be a full button down pajamas, just boxers would be fine in my book but at least cover up the most private parts of the human body. Am I crazy for thinking this? I understand where my boyfriend is coming from, it’s hot and uncomfortable but just putting on a pair of boxers shouldn’t make that much of a difference and it’s just something he needs to get used to. His argument is that parents bedrooms are supposed to be respected and kids will learn that before walking in. But we don’t have a bedroom, it’s a shared living room/bedroom without an actual door and he’s 3 years old. Which in my book is too young to understand any of that reasoning. 

So tell me reddit, am I the asshole for telling my boyfriend it’s time to stop sleeping naked?"
"AITA for having double standards when dealing with a vulnerable population? | I am a worker at a non-profit, and we deal with many clients who are in poverty.

I try my best to work with everyone, but unfortunately some people in these circumstances have so much hate in their heart (which they openly express), or probably some learning difficulty that I find it really hard to go above and beyond to try and help them, and I find myself more often just doing the bare minimum to encourage them. 

However, if the people are nice and pleasant I find myself going out of my way to find materials, travel, and just be there for them. 

Am I the asshole for just helping people who I think are the good people?"
"AITA because I'm picking my friend over my girlfriend? | throwaway as this is not a post for my main. 
I'm so conflicted that I need outsider judgment. 

around 2 weeks ago my best friends sister passed away from breast cancer, it's been super difficult for him and I've been helping as much as I can. they have planned the funeral for next Friday. 

last night my girlfriend's mum got in a car crash and passed away, they decided to plan the funeral on the Saturday after my friends sisters funeral. 

here is the issue 

the funeral for my mates sister is being held at a church that is a 4 hour drive away, I'm driving up on Thursday and planning on staying and helping until Saturday (the funeral is at night). (this was all planned before my girlfriends mums accadent) 

there is no way I can make both funerals as my girlfriends one starts at 8 in the morning. 

I've told her that I cant make it and she has been calling me selfish and telling me how I'm a dick of a boyfriend. 

we have been dating for 8 months and I've known my friend for 10 years. 

I'm 24

AITA?"
"AITA for refusing to see my brother's baby? | My brother has been dating Amber for close to five years. During one point of their relationship, she cheated on him with his best friend Jessie. They split for a few months and she continued to sleep with Jessie. It was messy as fuck and tore our friend group apart. My family told him to dump her. She comes back crying a few months later and pleading it was a mistake. He ends up forgiving her and low and behold she's pregnant. Everyone in my family says he needs to get a DNA test but he refuses. He says he's not worried about it because it has to be his due to timing. I don't believe this.

Baby is born in November and I keep getting pressured to see it because I'm the aunt. My mom continously is texting me ""when will the aunt see the baby?"" I say I will visit when they get a DNA test proving it belongs to my brother. I confronted my brother about this. He has the audacity to lie to me and say they did the DNA test ""when the baby was born in the hospital"". Yeah okay, bullshit. I tell him this is bullshit and not some routine test done. He doesn't press further.

At this point my family is calling me heartless because I have refused to see his kid. My sister says he refuses the DNA test. Everyone in my family has tried to get him to agree but he keeps repeating he's not worried about it because he loves the baby and it's his. My family says I need to love him because he's my brother. I disagree. I'm not being an aunt unless I know this kid belongs to my goddamn brother. I feel my brother is being willfully ignorant in this and therefore if I agree to this, I am agreeing to him never finding out if the kid is truly his and blindly throwing his life away.

Am I crazy? Am I an asshole?"
"AITA who ruined the trip? | Last year, my husband and I booked a trip to Iceland with a friend. A few weeks after hearing about our plans, my mom decided she and my brother would join and invited her husband, his daughter and her bf. 

We paid for ourselves but my mom and her husband paid for everyone else (everyone is adults though) 

Because of the large numbers we all decided it made sense to stay in a 4 bedroom Airbnb. My husband, friend and I cancelled our other accommodations to do this and offered to split the cost but we’re told they would cover it since they changed our plans. 

In the months leading up to the trip, I did all the research and planning, checked in with people before booking anything, and made all of the reservations for day trips, cars etc (and paid for them) 

Fast forward and we’re here. Upon arriving at the Airbnb my mom claimed 3 rooms: the master room with a bathroom for herself and husband, a room for his daughter and her bf and a room for my brother, leaving one bedroom for, me, my husband, and our two friends to share. Aka 5 Of them have 3 rooms and of us have one. 

When questioned on it she said: I paid for it so I’ll do what I want and refused to make any compromises. I’m furious and feel totally taken advantage of. Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for being upset that I'm being excluded from parties as a ""mature"" student"". | Obvious throwaway because my SO knows my reddit account.

I've been through some tough times and used to fuck around a lot in my early years. I drive a truck, but I wanted something more. It was tough, but at 31 I decided to finally go back to school. I'm what they call a ""mature student"".  Everyone is a lot younger, but it wasn't a big deal. I could always find people to talk to in class. I have a few good friends and a girlfriend outside of school, who graduated a long time ago. My girlfriend and I are currently in a LDR for her work. I miss her a lot.

&#x200B;

I've always been a very social person so I started to get really lonely. It was affecting me and I wasn't really into any of the clubs. I thought it would be a good idea to go to some parties and meet some people. Whenever I would go, I didn't know any of the music and the energy just seemed off. People were polite, never rude, but  I could tell they wanted to leave.

&#x200B;

I was feeling lonely again last night and thought I'd get up and take myself to one of the frats. I would try one more time. When I got to the door, there was a guy who let people in. He just brought me to the side and said ""hey man, you seem really cool and all. But it's kinda weird when you come to the parties. No one has anything against you, but you get it"". He told me it was *""better for everyone if I just didn't come around"",* but it was nothing personal. He gave me a beer and a pat on the back. I told him not to worry about it, but I was absolutely crushed. He could tell I was hurt and told me not to worry, because ""there's some students around your age you can party with"". I just smiled and went home.

&#x200B;

When I got home, I called my SO to tell her what happened. She was telling me not to worry but said that I have to understand why they might not want to party with me. It has nothing to do with me as a person, but it's weird if I want to party with them. She told me I shouldn't try again and to just go to bars with a buddy.

&#x200B;

I was really hurt that she said something like that. It's not cool to exclude anyone, especially for something as dumb as being a little older. We're all students. She knew how big of a decision it was for me to go back. I had to really swallow my pride.

&#x200B;

We got into an argument and by the end of it she told me to act my age. But I am acting my age. It's not unreasonable to want to be included by my peers.

ETA: detail"
"AITA for not wanting to be a sudden father? | Backstory- Five years ago, I was in a relationship with ""Amy"" that had run its course. I was 22 and working for $8/hour at one of my uncle's gas stations and living with my parents. She wanted to start a family immediately and I was not ready for that in any way. We split amicably and she goes on to date Allen, a friend of a friend who worked on the oil rigs. Amy gets pregnant almost immediately and almost nine months later she and Allen are parents to a baby girl, Amelia.

Fast forward to the present. Unfortunately, Allen was killed in a work accident. Amy ends up calling me not long after and tells me she thinks Amelia could be my daughter. The timing was close enough that she could have been pregnant just before we split up and nobody would have known any better since she was dating Allen only a week later. Amelia definitely looks more like me than Allen, so it's not out of the question. It also happens that I am now financially secure enough to support a family now that my uncle has retired and given me a stake in his business to keep me around to run things in his place.

I know it looks like Amy is just trying to find someone to pay the bills, but I believe her when she says there's a good chance Amelia could be my daughter. At the same time, I've barely met this kid. She was raised for years by Allen and by all rights that makes him her dad, not me. I feel bad for Amelia not having a father, but I don't really see why I should swoop in to become dad.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to find out whether Amelia is blood related to me and wanting to leave the past in the past? I don't want to be a replacement dad, I don't want to be financially on the hook for a kid I have only seen a few times in five years, and I don't want to be the piggy bank for Amy to not go to work. I don't hold any grudges over this and I don't blame Amy for doing anything she can for her kid, but this isn't my circus and these aren't my monkeys as far as I see it.

Edit- I will speak to a lawyer about this as some people have suggested. If I have a legal obligation then I have a legal obligation, but I still think Amelia is Allen's daughter regardless of blood. I'm going to step out and let the crowd judge, but I'll respond to info requests if I see them."
"AITA for being hurt by my daughter's name change | My wife kept her last name when we married, but we gave my last name to our children. My daughter changed her name to her husband's when she got married. They are now in the process of a divorce.

My daughter mentioned today that she wants to change her last name not back to my name, but to her mother's name. She wants to honor everything my wife has done for her.

I'm a little hurt by this and told her so. She's free to do as she pleases, but the presentation of it all just makes it feel like she values her mother's contribution over mine. AITA?"
"AITA for moving out of my in-laws' without my husband? | Obligatory background information and sorry for the chaos- my husband and I have been staying with his parents for about 6 months while we finish up building our home. We plan on selling it once it's done anyway because our plans in life have changed. I can literally not stand it there anymore, not because my in-laws are hugely awful but they really aren't people people. Also living in this house, albeit in a separate apartment with a separate entrance are my brother and sister-in-law. Everything started a few months ago, when my brother-in-law busted into where we live, I was alone, and berating me for living in his house, then leaving. This lead me to tell my husband, who tole his mom, who talked to his brother, who yelled at her...and nothing was resolved, and honestly, I didn't really need it to be. This happened a couple of more times, also some arguments between my husband and mother-in-law about trivial stuff, but these things make kind of a heavy environment to be in. Add to it the fact that my father-in-law cooks massive amounts of food that neither I nor my husband want to eat, and gets upset when we don't eat it, and will literally force stuff onto our plates when given the chance. He also gets upset when we do our own grocery shopping or go out to eat. This forces conflicts between my husband and father-in-law that I'm again, kind of stuck in the middle of, because I complain to my husband about the force feeding, he takes it personally and acts out to his father. 
FIL is also super frugal so we have to do things like sit in the dark, not flush the toilet each time and shower at the gym so we save water and electricity. This is super annoying.
This final straw though came yesterday, when after a conflict involving some sand leftover in the entryway that wasn't cleaned up (because I wasn't aware of it, I had the flu and no reason to leave the house), FIL called me down and told me to explain how the sand got there if it wasn't there when he left for work, I said it was probably from my husband's shoes and just cleaned it up but told my husband after. My husband goes on a rant to his father about all the stuff I listed above and then my mother-in-law inserts herself and calls me down to apologize or whatever and I'm like dying from flu muscle pain and not wanting to move. So I don't and she's just yelling away about how she's sorry about nothing and it's not like I cared. So today I went down to my FIL to apologize for being sick and not talking and for my husband. He starts telling me how normal people wipe their shoes and yadda yadda and how he'll never ask me about a meal again and basically just very poignontly telling me the things that bother me shouldn't and that he takes it personally. And I was like yup, that's a no for me dog, so I packed up some of my stuff and drove to an empty apartment we keep about an 1,5h away. Without my husband. He is super upset and we don't really know what to do now because he works near the in-laws' so he can't really move here with me...the whole point of us living their in the first place.

tl;dr- moved out of my in-laws' without my husband because of tons of conflict in their household that spilled over. He is upset. AITA?"
"AITA for getting angry my girlfriend got a tattoo honouring her dead boyfriend (she didn't tell me before hand) | My girlfriend and I have been together for 9 month. About 1 month ago her ex boyfriend died of a drug over dose. I never met the guy and I only know about him from what my girlfriend said about him. Basically they had been friends for years (since their freshman year in college) because they were in the same small program and dated for about 2 years before they broke u. They had been broken up for 2 months when we started dating.

&#x200B;

Apparently he had issues with drugs for a long time but she thought he was clean when they started dating but then he started them again during their relationship. Initially she tried to be supportive and help him through the addiction and help him get sober but it was too much strain on the relationship and he started becoming emotionally abusive so they eventually broke up. She's kind of a goody two shoes type girl who is super studious, who doesn't even party much and it kinda seems this guy was her ""bad boy phase."" Again I've never met the guy, this was just the impression I got from him.

&#x200B;

Anyway he sadly died 1 month ago from an accidental overdose and my girlfriend was devastated. His parent invited her to the funeral which I thought was a bit odd but I was supportive of her going. It seems she blames herself partly for his death.

&#x200B;

However I soon started getting annoyed at some of the things she keeps doing. She has posted 5 pictures of him on her instagram since his death. I get she was mourning but I don't think all mourning has to be pubic on social media and that was even more pictures that we have together on her social media. I think it unnecessary and disrespectful to me. I told her this bothers me and she kind of brushed it off and acted like I was over reacting but said she would stop.

&#x200B;

Then yesterday i found out she got a tattoo of a guitar with his initials on it. The tattoo is about 4 inches long.   Her ex was an avid guitar player. Obviously I was really mad. She didn't even consult me or check with me if it was okay and just got a permanent reminder of her ex on her body. This obviously wasn't a spur of the moment decision either.She only has one other tattoo which honours her late grandmother and her own parents hate tattoos and were mad she got that one. I confronted her and told her she obviously has no respect for our relationship  and she said it's her body and she didn't think she needed to consult me and I was acting like a controlling asshole and acting jealous of someone who was dead.

&#x200B;

AITA here?"
"AITA for telling my mom to blame her fucking son | I'ma summarize what just happened

I was upstairs treating this allergic reaction. I gave my siblings peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and let them play on Roblox. My mom came home as I was treating my rash. She starts yelling bc my brother (5) put peanut butter on the couch. She yells at me saying how I should've watched them instead of staying upstairs. She then starts saying she'll kick me out and other bullshit. I told her ""Why are you blaming me? It wasn't even me who did it, it was (inserts brother's name)"". She then says she doesn't give a fuck and he's just a baby and doesn't know better. It's my fault

Also I can't tell her I have an allergic reaction bc I'll just get yelled at more. I just wear long sleeve clothes to hide it and use lotion to help w it.

AITA for calling her out

I'm not allergic to peanut butter btw. Idk what I'm getting this allergic reaction from. All Ik is that it's spreading but hopefully it'll die down?"
"AITA for yelling at my husband is earshot of neighbors? | So I work rotating shift and was just finishing the last night of my 7 nights in my rotation.  After work this morning when I left at 7 am I went out and got essentials for the household because starting Monday I am sequestered for 2 weeks with no contact with my family.  Got my husband some yard tools he requested as well.  I got home around 1030 and went to go take a nap at 11 with plans to to wake up by 3 pm.  Well my husband began using the chainsaw RIGHT outside our bedroom window on tree.  This is NOT one of the new tools I purchased him.  I obviously was awoken and looked at my phone and it was 12.  I thought 'alright he knows I am trying to sleep I am sure it will just be a quick thing.' Nope.  I tried to go back to sleep and he continued to use this chainsaw for over an hour.  I tried texting him but he didn't have his phone on him.  My adrenaline is  pumping.  I can feel myself getting heated.  Frustrated that and exhausted.  I go outside admittedly looking like a crazy person, hair wild, and in PJ's.  I his back is to me with the chainsaw ripping and I yell something along the lines of ""SERIOUSLY WTF?! YOU KNOW I AM TRYING TO SLEEP!!  WTF ARE YOU DOING?!! FUCKING STOP FOR FUCKS SAKE!!!""  I am not aware of my surrounding or who is outside and am seeing red.  He immediately get pissed says WTF and walks off.  I go back inside and try to get some more sleep.. It is now 115 pm and I do not fall back to sleep for another hour and half due to adrenaline.   I finally wake up after 5 pm two hours after what I planned for the day.  My husband is obliviously pissed at me and I talk to him about it.  He said I emasculated him in front of multiple neighbors who were also outside.  We are newish to the neighborhood and we really do not know the neighbors. I can only imagine I look like a lazy wife who was sleeping in the middle of the day and yelling at her husband for working. I apologized and explained that I listened for over an hour of the chainsaw and I lost it.  I told him he expects everyone to be quiet when he is sleeping and he needs to practice what preaches.  He said its different because its the middle of the day and he needs to get shit done.  He also said he was also just not thinking about me.  That statement was a little fucked to me because I go out of my way to make him happy. I.E spending time and money in the morning to get him what he wanted.  As a note I am  the sole provider for the household.  And try my hardest to make everyone happy.

He is still mad at me and told me not to come near him for the rest of the night.  Obviously I am hurt by this because starting Monday I am sequestered for 2 weeks and will not be seeing my family.

AITA for yelling at my husband while I was trying to sleep in the middle of the day for running a chainsaw out by our bedroom window?"
"AITA For not wanting to drink out of the same glass after my son? | I love my kids and have raised them the best I could.  This past weekend like every other weekend my now adult son has his now adult girlfriend over.  My wife and I tend to the house doing our weekend house work.  She's cleaning and vacuuming and I'm in the yard pulling weeds from the cracks in the concrete and mowing the lawn.  My kids are in the house playing video games and having fun with their friends.  When my wife calls me in for lunch I wrap up and go in to grab a bite to eat.  While eating my son grabs my glass and takes a drink.  With out making any big deal or even thinking twice I tell my wife I'll grab some more salad from the frig and I also grab another glass for myself.

&#x200B;

My wife knows I'm a bit of a germophobe and notices the extra glass I brought back to the table with the salad.  I do not think anyone else notices.  Later in the day she tells me I'm acting ridiculous and that she saw what I did.  I respond by telling her the truth.  Our boy has a girlfriend and I don't know what she's got and have no intentions of catching anything from either of them.

&#x200B;

TL DR  AITA For not wanting to drink out of the same glass after my son?"
"WIBTA for limiting my roommates boyfriend’s WiFi speed? | One of my roommates always has her boyfriend over. She duplicated her key for him so he comes and goes as he pleases, takes up space in our fridge, and does his laundry at our place.

For all intents and purposes (except legally I suppose) he basically lives in our apartment now. He doesn’t contribute towards utilities or rent (and if he does, he’s probably splitting just her share of the utilities and not letting us split evenly.) 

I’ve toyed with the idea of smoking him out with the WiFi — using the QoS settings to slow down his devices to a really slow speed. My justification is that he doesn’t pay for the internet but he’s always on it. 

WIBTA if I were to do this? I’ve noticed an uptick in all our utilities in general, and it’s borderline weird how settled in he’s become."
"AITA for getting mad over an incident at my grandfather's funeral service? | For some background, I have an older brother that has, for my entire life, been prone to giving me unsolicited life advice. Giving it often, and giving it vocally. I have also, at times, had problems with my physical health.

 After recently being a pallbearer at my grandfather's funeral service, my brother, around 15 minutes after we had put the coffin in the hearse, came up to me, and said ""He lived a long life. Have to stay healthy if you want to live that long."" I was pissed that he took this opportunity, literally minutes after carrying our grandfather's coffin, to try and tell me how I should live my life. I called him an asshole, and stormed away. Am I the asshole, though?"
"AITA? My husband thinks I am because I've missed a lot of work and lied about why | Four months ago my husband told me I better get help because he wasn't going to put up with my behaviour - calling in sick to work saying I have a migraine (even though I don't) and basically sleeping all day. I had a pattern of doing this occasionally in the years before, but in the months before his ultimatum I'd been calling in increasingly more, to the point of missing work several days in a row some weeks. I knew I was risking getting fired, but I couldn't make myself care enough to drag my butt out of bed. Missing work also hurt our finances because we do need my income, which was my husband's main concern.

I trust my husband's judgement, even though I also think he can be lacking in empathy, so I went to my doctor and told her what was going on. She did some tests, and I was diagnosed as having severe depression. I'm now on medication and seeing a psychologist, and I've gotten much better but still have occasional bad days and call in sick. I don't want to fess up to my work that I lied when I told them I suffer from migraines, so I continue to use that as my reason when I call. I feel guilty for lying but I think it wouldn't help anyone to come clean. I'm also uncomfortable with telling them I have a mental illness and afraid of the stigma associated.

My husband says since I'm getting treatment I should be able to suck it up and just go to work on the bad days, and that lying to my work is an asshole move. Am I being an asshole?

(If this sounds familiar it's probably because I've reposted this. My earlier post was removed because I left out the conflict part, so I added that in.)

Edit: Thank you all for the replies. I really appreciate that people are taking time to tell me what they think, regardless of what they have to say. 

I'd like to clear up a few things that I seem to have failed to get across. First off, I probably should have mentioned that I'm in Canada, not the US. Several people have offered advice regarding programs and employment law, but it seems to be all about US law. (Thanks anyway, I appreciate the thought.) Second, some people seem to be thinking I lied to my husband as well as to my work. I never lied to him, just to my supervisor at work. Also, the financial impact of me missing work isn't dire, although it does matter. We've had to adjust how much we're putting aside for retirement but I'm not getting no income at all and I'm still paying my share of the bills."
"AITA for dating a man 28 years older than me? My parents are coming apart at the seams. | For reference I'm 27 and he's 55. We have been dating about a month and it's the most amazing relationship I've ever been in. He's kind, he's generous, he's in great shape and he has none of the insecurities I've encountered in other guys.

My parents are about to flip out and cut me off. My mom even called me a sugar baby and my dad isn't speaking to me at all. I feel they've made commitments to me but never stipulated that they can control my behavior with them. 

Am I the asshole here?"
"AITA for asking a guy I know who's a drug addict and unemployable why the fuck he has FOUR kids? | I've known this guy for almost 8 years. In that time he's had two kids and he is the ULTIMATE FUCK-UP!  Every time there's a narrative he spouts about how he's going to ""turn his life around"" because he has a kid on the way. It's like a loop he's repeated four times now. In the last 8 years he has also proven himself to be thoroughly unemployable...survives on social assistance and whatever he can mooch from friends and family...doesn't even have the wherewithal to be a decent criminal and maybe make money that way.

So I asked him why he has kids and he ...  EXPLODED!  A torrent of rage and self-defensive anger!

And then he was like ""you don't like my kids?!?!?""  I baby sit this guy's kids when he and his ridiculous wife can't care for them, which is more often than I would like."
"WIBTA if I left my baby with my mum and ran away. | so im 18 years old and 36 weeks pregnant, I was not allowed an abortion and so I'm currently carrying a baby I dont want. 
I got pregnant at 17 and so my mum was able to stop an abortion from happening. 
i wanted to put the baby up for adoption but mum has convinced me it's a terrible idea. 

WIBTA if I ran away and left my mother to care for the baby as it seems she really likes it. 

it's a girl btw. 

I've already packed a bag that my mum thinks is a hospital bag but is actually a bag for when I run away."
"AITA for not letting my ex get his cat back? | My ex and I dated for 2.5 years and the cat has lived at my house with me and my parents for a year. He broke up with me 2 months ago. On the night that he broke up with me, he asked if I would be comfortable keeping the cat until he found a place for him to stay (he couldn't live at my ex's house because his family is allergic). I agreed, but at this point I assumed we would stay friends or get back together. 

My ex proceeded to begin publicly seeing another girl a week later, no word about the cat. I picked up the remainder of my stuff from him a month after the breakup, no word about the cat. I went on a trip out of the country and while there, my ex posted on social media that he was officially in a relationship with the girl he had been seeing (and who, at this point, I'm fairly confident he had cheated on me with). I was tipsy, drinking wine and enjoying my vacation in Spain, and my friends kept sending me photos of them together being like ""oh my godd"" and I didn't want to see it anymore. I was feeling petty and wine drunk and 'laugh reacted' to this relationship status. 

My ex blocked me on all social media after I did this. In turn, I blocked his number for peace of mind. Since then, my best friend who is our mutual friend has also blocked me for no apparent reason. It has been upwards of 3 weeks since he blocked me. Today my dad approached me saying that my ex texted him, saying he made a vet appointment for the cat tomorrow and he would be there to pick him up in the morning. 

After 2 months of no contact regarding the cat, plus the blocking on all forms of social media, I had pretty much assumed the cat was mine. In my opinion, he lost the right to contact me about anything, including the cat, after blocking me. Blocking someone from contacting you implies that you do not intend to speak to them, ever again!! And all of a sudden, he wants to come take the cat that MY FAMILY has financially supported and grown attached to for a year? 

So I called him and he got upset, claiming I couldn't just keep his cat and it isn't fair. But I feel as though he doesn't have the cat's best interest in mind. He's willing to uproot the animal for completely selfish reasons from a home where he has lived for a year, with other cats to play with, a stable financial environment where he will always have what he needs. My family is not okay with giving the cat back to him. 

Am i wrong for believing his chance to make plans regarding our cat was when he blocked me from contacting him in any way?

EDIT: I was told I should add some info -  
My ex did not live with me and my family. Last year, he moved back home from an apartment, but since his family was allergic, we decided the cat could stay with my family until the two of us moved into our own place together. The original arrangement was that the cat would stay with my family for a few months- it has been a year.

The cat is 3 years old. He got him about 5 or 6 months before we started dating. The cat probably doesn't even remember a time that i wasn't around. I personally did not financially contribute to the cat for the 1.5 years he wasn't at my house - however I did watch the cat/take care of him as needed. Then for the past year my parents have assumed full financial responsibility. My ex has not provided food, litter, or anything. The only financial assistance was the vet appointment to get him shots and fixed before he even moved into my house. In addition he did not try to contact me at all regarding the cat since the day we broke up and I said I could keep him for a bit. I wasn't anticipating 2 months of no contact at all, just waiting around for him to decide what to do..."
"AITA for still holding it against my dad for not taking me on a vacation when I was 13? | I'm know this sounds really petty.

When I was 13, I had to go to my grandma's funeral in another state with my mom. A few months after I got back, i found out that my dad, my stepmom and my stepsiblings had gone on vacation to a place I always wanted to go to. They went in the same week I went got my grandma's funeral.

The only reason I found out was because my stepsister accidentally started reminiscing about the trip and stopped herself too late.

I felt like a total fool. My dad apologized profusely and said the timing only worked for that week and they didn't want me to feel worse. But I never accepted his apology. I was already feeling replaced for a while at that point.

Since that day, my behavior my dad's house did a 180. I used to be the well behaved kid. But I decided I was going to make him ""pay"". So I was a total jerk. My dad ended up paying double the child support because I refused to stay nights. I wrecked a lot of their house in secret. It was literally constant fighting in their house when I was around. I did some pretty awful things.

A few years later, my dad ""surprised"" me with a trip to the same place they had gone to without me. I guess he hoped it would fix things. But at this point I was almost 17 and not interested in the slightest. He ended up cancelling everything.

I said some really terrible things to my dad. It got really bad and he cried.

That incident made me really guilty so I stopped being a jerk to him. But I also kind of stopped being around him. I'm a lot happier not dealing with him and his family. And I just figured he would be too.

So I just have occasional contact with my dad when I am visiting home from college.

I'm going to graduate college in a few months. I got a text from my father saying he was proud of me for being the first one in our family to graduate college. I got it right before a midterm so I read it but forgot about it.

I then got another text yesterday saying he preferred me hating him instead of ignoring him. I haven't responded yet.

I know and accept I was an asshole growing up. But AITA for maintaining a distant but non-hostile relationship with him now? 

For me, the vacation I missed out on is still a sore point because it represents him finding a new family and pushing me to the side.

And I don't really miss his presence in my life."
"AITA for breaking a kid’s nerf gun? | I was walking home yesterday, and this kid started shooting me with the nerf gun while insulting me in front of his friends. I  ̶t̶o̶l̶d̶ warned him that if he does that again, I’ll break his nerf gun.

The next day, the kid does it again so I yank it out of his hand, and smash it on the pavement as hard as I fucking can, and pieces go flying everywhere. The kid starts crying in front of his friends, and I just walk back home. 

Am I the asshole? You decide."
"AITA for being disappointed in my gf's gifts every year? | Me and my gf are both 21 and have been dating for almost three years (since beginning of college). 

So far we have experienced two christmases and birthdays together where we are officially dating and this upcoming holidays will be our third. Because I feel it might matter, I will include that my birthday is in December near Christmas and hers is in January. 

Every year we have been together I always get her two separate, really nice gifts for Christmas and then her birthday. They're usually something she had been wanting and that I know she probably would not expect so its a surprise for her. For example, gifts I have given in the past were a pair of birkenstock sandals, a nice dress and accessories from Urban Outfitters, tickets for us to Disneyland. As you can see they're usually pretty big gifts and if its something small like the clothes, I include stuff so that it's more fulfilling, like putting an outfit together instead of just the dress for example. 

Our first official Christmas that we were dating, she didn't personally get me anything :(. Her parents got me a phone mount for the car which she gave me as my gift. She got me something for my birthday (i cant remember what) but I was pretty sad that she didn't get me anything for Christmas when I put a lot of thought into her gift. 

The next year she got me tickets for my birthday for this rapper I really like which was awesome and I loved the gift, but for Christmas she gave me a half-completed drawing on a canvas of C3PO (Im a star wars fan). This is also a nice gift and thoughtful but I was disappointed because she never made an effort to actually finish the piece so I didn't really ever get to enjoy it. 

This year, her ""surprise"" for my birthday gift got ruined on accident so I know what it is and I was kinda sad when I found out. It's this small over the shoulder bag that I had mentioned I might get in passing in one of our conversations. I wasn't even that enthusiastic about getting it and I probably wasn't going to buy it but now I've come to find out she got it as my gift. I know price shouldn't be a problem but its also a really cheap bag, just something you might get on an impulse buy. 

I am grateful for what she gets me but I can't help but feel disappointed when I see friends with significant others who get them these big and meaningful gifts for the holidays or can turn small gifts into larger meaningful ones. 

Before you say I should communicate this with her, I have in the past. Once when we had a fight, I mentioned how I was hurt that she didn't get me anything for Christmas and just gave me her parents gift to which she acknowledged and said she would be more thoughtful with the gifts. But it just seems to not get better. I'm pretty sad but also know that there are more things to life so I try not to get down about it. I just wish she thought of it as more of an important gesture like I see it. 

So, AITA?"
"AITA For treating boys and girls differently when they needed the bathroom? | I used to be a sub for about a year. I taught a fair amount of middle school and high school. I didn’t always agree with how the bathroom rules were set up but I made sure I stuck to whatever the school or teacher wanted for the most part. 

Most of the time teachers would have a one person at a time rule. So if someone was already gone the other had to wait. I got around this by telling the students (if another was gone) if they had to go that bad they can risk getting caught in the hall and had to accept whatever consequence came their way. 

The way I differed was I would always ask something along the lines of “can it wait?”  Most responses even from girls would usually be yes or the pee dance and “I have to go really bad.” Then they had the option to go without a pass. 

Now the difference. If a girl gave me a definitive “NO” like this can’t fucking wait kind of context I just told them “go and don’t worry about security.” Now the reason was I am a man and I wasn’t going to ask a girl why or push the issue because they are old enough that they are getting their periods. It was not a battle that was worth fighting. Some boys complained and if they got more upset I only told them that they took health class and should know why. 

I told this story to some male friends and some of them said I should have treated them all the same. My argument was there is no way I can reasonably do that without getting in trouble because men don’t have the same issues.

Edit: sorry maybe I didn’t make it clear but I did let them go if they told me no they couldn’t wait. They just had to go without a pass and if they were caught then they got whatever consequence came.

Edit 2: hopefully I will make much clearer here what I did and why. This never came up but if a girl had to leave for what I suspected was her period and got caught I would have tried to get her out of trouble. It was to hedge my bets from getting complaints over this. Where I live if a sub gets two or three complaints they are done. I wanted to enforce rules so I wouldn’t get complaints but I also didn’t want to get complaints for enforcing stupid rules either. So I tried to find a middle ground that kept them to what I hoped was nothing. I really hope this clarifies things."
AITA for reclining my seat in an airplane? | It happened to me a while ago. It was a long flight and I wanted to lay back and sleep. I put my seat back and the guy behind me complained about not having enough room. Am I the asshole for not wanting to put my seat back into an upright position? 
"AITA for making an older woman cry before 8:30 AM? | I made an old woman cry before 8:30 AM...AITA

I (26f) have a co-worker (60ishf) who recently started working in our office. She is great. She is kind, resourceful, knowledgeable, and overall just a considerate person. I like her. Here is the catch...she refuses to look at client activity logs. An activity log will show you everything done in a clients account. Its like their diary of sorts. If you want to know whats going on in a clients account, the activity log is where you go to find it. We have reminded her multiple times that the best way to handle an account is to read the activity log first.

&#x200B;

Now its around 8:15AM and I hear her make a phone call to a client I have been working with daily for the last 2 weeks. Im immediately concerned as this client is an ASSHOLE and will not be happy that he is getting a call from our office before 9AM. Right away I can hear that he is being a jerk to her and I tell her to put him on hold. She does so, but at this point im fired up at what I consider to be her laziness in reading the activity log. Ive been dealing with this douche canoe on a daily basis and she is about to fuck up all my work. I admittedly raised my voice (I DID NOT YELL) and said ""Get off the phone with him right now, you have no reason to be calling him, that is my client, I've worked with him daily. Did you even look at the activity log?"" She says ""No..."" At this point, douche canoe client has hung up on her and Im now pissed. I raised my voice and said ""All you have to do is read the activity log to know that you didn't need to make that call, or piss off a client that I now have to deal with later!"".

&#x200B;

I realized I was short with her and said ""Im sorry, that was not a kind reaction from me."" She then starts to silently cry. She gets up and goes to the bathroom. My other coworkers are saying im an asshole. I dont think so. Not only has she been told before to read activity logs first, but I also immediately and publicly apologized. She didn't do her job right and as a result I will have to deal with it. Am I the Asshole?

&#x200B;

Edit: For clarification of story: The asshole client was on hold and did not hear the exchange between myself and my co-worker. He hung up after less than 10 seconds on hold of his own accord because he is an asshole. She does not work for me, however I've been in the department the longest and I was tasked with showing her the ropes for the last 90 days. Im not a manager. With that being said this is a reoccurring issue that had been discussed with her multiple times by myself and our manager. I did speak with her later one on one and apologized again. She accepted the apology and promised she would make more of an effort to remember to look at the activity logs before calling clients. We are good."
"AITA for saying cooking counts as a chore? | This may be more of a relationships question, but I'd like a quick ruling on a fairly simple situation.

Me (29M) has recently moved in with my girlfriend (28F). We've been together for almost 3 years but this is our first time living together. Obviously we have spent a lot of time at each other's places, but never had ""our"" own home.

We are discussing how to share responsibility for household chores and hit a snag. Which brings me here. I will try and be fair to both sides.

I like to cook. And I'm good at it. Really good at it. It's one of my primary hobbies and I enjoy it immensely. I make everything from scratch and am pretty capable with most 'types' of cuisines. I serve restaurant quality shit, if I do say so myself. GF cannot cook at all. So I do 100% of the cooking, usually 5 nights a week we eat at home.

Typical routine for me is to get home from work around 6:00, spend about an hour cooking, and GF and I eat dinner around 7:00-7:15. She gets home at the same time and uses that hour to unwind by herself. The cooking is my way of unwinding; I find it relaxing. I also do all the clean up, since I'm pretty good about cleaning as I go and just rinse stuff out and load the dishwasher as I'm cooking. After we eat, I throw in the dinner plates and wipe the counter down and I'm done.

When discussing chore division, I say that I spend an hour a day cooking and that counts as a chore. GF disagrees. Says since I enjoy cooking and it's my hobby, it's not a chore. 

I, obviously, disagree. Yes, I enjoy cooking. But I think it's still a chore. And she's reaping the benefits from it. She points out that she was perfectly happy subsisting on microwavable food before she met me, and it's my choice to cook. I point out I'm a guy, and my tolerance for bathroom cleanliness is far, far different than hers, so does that mean she shouldn't count cleaning the bathrooms as a chore? She says she doesn't enjoy cleaning the bathrooms, and she doesn't claim her hobbies like knitting as a chore. I say her knitting doesn't benefit ""us"" or ""our home."" She says enjoyed hobbies cannot count as chores.

Thus, we are at an impasse.

GF agrees I should get 'credit' for the cleanup and dishes, but not for the actual cooking. I want 'credit' for all of it.

Who's the AH?

EDIT: Maybe credit is the wrong word. We are trying to divvy up chores equally, so there has to be some way to divide them. We're going with time. Cleaning the bathroom is worse than taking out the garbage, because it's a 20 minute job vs a 5 minute job. So it wound't be fair for her to clean the bathroom every week while I take out the garbage. We aren't keeping score; just trying to be fair."
"AITA for asking for a necklace back? | Not sure if this concerns rule 8 or not, as it does involve a breakup.

My girlfriend and I broke up after 4 years of dating. Found her cheating blah blah, long story.

The thing is, for our 4th anniversary, I bought her a rose quartz necklace that took a LOT of saving to buy. (If you're wondering, it was custom made with diamonds set around it, hence the price. Ex liked rose quartz).

Would I be the asshole if, this weekend when I go get my stuff from her place, I ask for the necklace back?

Edit: Forgot to clarify, it was kind of like a promise ring, hence why I feel justified in asking for it back. I genuinely thought I was going to marry her at the time."
"AITA owner blames me for causing her cat to die | Not really sure how to caption this but here goes...Monday morning I heard noise outside the house and saw a cat  getting mauled by 3 feral dogs. As much as I felt sorry for the kitty I was not going to challenge 3 dogs to save it, and nobody was home, so all I could do was to throw a few coke cans from the 2nd storey to scare them off. Didn't work.


I only dared to walk out when the dogs were gone and found the cat already dead. I snapped a few pictures and posted it to the neighborhood group chat. Since nobody seemed to know where the cat came from, I couldn't leave all that to rot at my doorstep. I called up some cleaning services and had them dispose the cat, clean up the rest of the mess and disinfect the area.


Yesterday I got a visit from an angry crying lady claiming that the cat was hers, and she accused me of killing her cat. Well not literally, she understood that the dogs did the job, but she was upset that:

1. I did not save it

2. I threw it away like trash

3. ""Showing off"" its carcass to ""gain attention""


All I could do was to apologise, I couldn't really argue with a grieving person. After letting her blowing up all that steam she finally left. I am now wondering if it is really my fault, even though I apologized to her I don't really think I am to be blamed for the cat's death. Who lets their cat out with feral dogs in the neighborhood? And what was I supposed to do with its carcass? Leaving it to rot till the owner shows up? AITA?


FYI: For those concerned about why I post the pictures, people in the group do that all the time when we find dead or injured animals, not the first time somebody's pet got mauled by the dogs already, and they could carry diseases. I did not post it as a showoff, more like a warning "" feral dogs strike here"" and ""Does anyone know if this cat has an owner?"". Nobody at that time responded, so I assumed it was a stray had it cleaned up."
"AITA for not caring about my boyfriend’s sisters baby? | My boyfriend and I have been dating for 5 years. In that time span, I’ve said maybe two sentences to his sister. She’s anti social, hates her own family, selfish, and surprised everyone when she told us she was 6 months pregnant. 

The parents were very hurt she didn’t tell them sooner and very concerned that she hasn’t been to a doctor or done any kind of planning for a baby. 

I’ve never spoken to the baby’s daddy (seen him around bfs parents’ house a few times). I’ve tried to make conversation around the holidays but neither of them want to participate in anything. 

She’s working at some shoe store and I don’t think the baby daddy has a job. She’s even had to ask her family for money because this guy obviously can’t support her or the baby. 

I love my boyfriend and his family very dearly. His sister? Not so much. I have no relationship with her. I was invited to the baby shower this week (by their Mom not the sister).  Needless to say I have no interest in her or going to this shower. 

I feel bad because their Mom is trying to include me in family matters. But I don’t want to give her a gift or pretend I care. Haven’t RSVPd yet. 

So Reddit, AITA for having zero interest? Advice if I should go or not is welcome.

Edit: My boyfriend has no relationship with her. His Dad doesn’t either. Only the mom has some sort of relationship with her.  No males are going to shower. The sister would literally not give a single shit if I was there or not. 

Edit: I might just send the gift and not attend."
"AITA for getting mad at my girlfriend for snooping through my phone? | We're both 20 and been together for little over a year. We actually had our anniversary 3 weeks ago and (I thought) all was good, we live together.

So today she snooped through my phone. I was sleeping and I woke up to her using me phone, no biggie. But when I dozed off and woke up again like 15 minutes later she was still on my phone and I asked her what she was doing. She straight up told me that she was going through my phone to see if I had anything to hide. I got mad and told her to stop but she didn't and locked herself in the bathroom. She came out maybe 10 minutes later and said everything was fine. I told her it wasn't, and that this was not okay and she got mad at me and we got into an argument and she called me a jerk.

Now about 2 months ago I made a mistake. I was at a party and got almost blackout drunk, and I ended up making out with another girl. I felt an extreme amount of guilt and shame, and I went home straight after it happened and told my girlfriend. I didn't use the alcohol as an excuse, I'm just mentioning it because it did play a role. I told her that it was completely my fault and that I would understand and respect it if she wanted to break up, but that I would do everything to make things right with her if she decided to stay with me. Thank god she did, and I thought we were doing better already. I don't drink anymore and share everything with my girlfriend. We have an open phone policy but only if we need to use it real quick or something, not to investigate and go through my entire phone to find proof of me cheating.

I still feel like shit for what I did and I understand she needs time to get over it, but I think what she did is a bit too excessive and not cool. Am I the asshole for getting mad at her?"
"AITA for yelling at my dad for bringing in more furniture? | My dad has a history of collecting what I think is old junk. He frequently buys old, run down cars (we have 7 cars at home right now, not a single one was manufactured in the past 10 years, most of them are 1980-2000s cars, 3 of them don't run. We also have 2 cars in the back yard, and neither of them run.) and he frequently brings in old furniture/refuses to throw away old furniture. This wouldn't be too much of an issue for me normally, I don't mind people's hobbies and if he wants to collect stuff, sure, whatever. The problem comes up because our home is extremely small. We have a tiny backyard, we have little to no room in our actual home because it's so crowded, and our garage has been turned into my dad's office space. To make room for all the extra junk my parents have, we had to build two closed off decks that have file cabinets full of things like plates, cooking ware, bowls, cups, tools, etc. Him buying any extra cars or furniture takes up what little space we have left. My mom and I have expressed this to him many times, but each time he just dismisses us and ignores us. He sometimes even shushes us.

My dad also doesn't work close to home. He works in NorCal (we live in SoCal) and we either visit him or he comes back home around 2-3 times a month. He came back for Thanksgiving on Wednesday. Today, somehow, he picked up a wood and glass display cabinet from who knows where, and I lost it. I yelled at him.

""Why do you even need these things? What the fuck are we going to do with a glass display cabinet? What are we going to put in there? And just because something is free doesn't mean you should take it. What if we want to move some place else? Have you considered that your shit would make it harder to move? What about your cars? You spend thousands of dollars on these shitty beater cars that you might as well just buy a new car at that point! This is a problem you have and you need to stop, because I'm fucking sick and tired of you bringing in shit that you never use!"" I also threatened to take an axe to whatever he brings in from off the street, and break the windows of any ""new"" cars he buys.

AITA for screaming at him like that? I dislike his hobby and I think it is in no way helpful to us, but I feel like I could have been nicer about it or handled it better."
"AITA for telling my history teacher that he needs to to a better job teaching us | Background my history teacher is bad at his job. He never gives us anything to study and tells us how disappointed he is with us because we didn’t do good on a test. He also gives us Projects every other week with insane expectations.

Well yesterday we had to present a project to the class. One of my friends in my group doesn’t like to speak in front of the class and started crying from stress. My teacher told her to quit complaining and I told him that he either needs to be a better teacher or find a different job.
Most of the class agrees but I got a detention for this. AITA"
AITA went to an Elton John concert and got yelled at and harassed for standing and dancing during “dance” songs | So my friend and I went to an Elton John concert last night and the older people behind us started tugging on my friends jacket when we stood up and started screaming and dancing when he came out on stage with his opening song”Bennie and the Jets”.   So my friend turns around and is leaning over her chair saying “come on get up and dance” that the older woman pinches my friends arm and tells her to sit down. Of course my friend was upset the woman had pulled on her and physically touched her. I don’t care how old you are it is never ok to touch someone like that EVER. So my friend says look I’ll compromise if it’s a dance song we’re going to dance otherwise we will sit. Now 90% of the time we sat and clapped and screamed from our seats and just enjoyed the music and show. It wasn’t until the encore that our section finally all started standing and getting into the music. AITA for enjoying the music and wanting to stand and dance and cheer at a concert?? 
"WIBTA if I donated sperm behind my parents' back | I am going to be 22 in a few months, and I want to donate sperm. I have a couple reasons, first of all, I can make $500+ a month doing it, second of all, I have always wanted to have a lot of children, and third of all, the thought of donating my sperm turns me on. My parents only know about the first two reasons, but they think it's a bad idea, but they've never really given a reason why, other than to say it's ""concerning"" and ""ridiculous"".

They are paying for my college education, but I would use my own money to get to and from the sperm clinic, and they would never have to know."
"WIBTA for asking my friend's widow for his writing materials. | So my friend and I were both writers (nothing professional or anything). And he very suddenly passed away in his sleep. After processing what happened, I got this itch to get what material he had written for this fantasy novel he was working on and finish it for him in his memory. However, I want to give his wife (who I don't know well at all) some space to grieve and I don't want her to feel like I'm taking advantage of her husband's passing. "
"AITA for punishing my 13yo son for calling me by my real name? | My 13yo has been acting like a smart ass. Borderline disrespectful. He used to call me ""daddy"" until he was 9, then it was ""dad."" Now he's trying to call me by ""James"" which is my real name. I told him to call me ""dad"" and he refused because ""dad"" is a baby word and his friends call their parents by their real names. Now I haven't been 13 in decades, but I don't believe his logic or his story. He's just being an ass so I grounded him and took away his electronics for a week for calling me ""James."" Now he seems even more determined to call me something else."
"WIBTA if I (32F) make a decision about my pregnancy on my own, without telling the ex long term partner (31M) who walked away last month that it's his child and giving him a voice? | One week after filing taxes together as married to legitimize a common law marriage, my (now ex) partner of 3 years left me. We were traveling abroad at the time, with original plans to continue through the end of the year (work sabbatical). I'd sold my car, rented my house out, and left my job to prepare for this travel. He left without much of an explanation other than ""it's over."" He's spent the last couple of weeks oscillating between ignoring me over text, and tearing me down in ways I didn't know were possible. We still own a house together. Devastated doesn't begin to describe how I feel.

I'm now back home trying to rebuild the pieces from the ground up. Last month, right before this all happened, we had a pregnancy scare. The test came back negative at that point, and we moved on.

The test didn't come back negative this month.

This is absolutely his child, but he's hurt me so much these last few weeks that I don't think I could ever forgive him. I don't want him involved in this decision, or honestly this pregnancy at all. Some of the things he's said recently are completely irreparable.

However, I think I want this child. And I think I want it without him. I'm in my 30s with a successful career, and I could do this on my own. I don't think iwant him involved in this at all, neither rights nor responsibilities.

WIBTA if I make a decision about this pregnancy without consulting him?"
"AITA for refusing to buy my kids a Switch? | My kids (6&9) say they want a Nintendo Switch, cuz that's what most of their friends want. My husband and I can afford to buy this for them, but I know that in a month it will be a dust collector. My kids aren't heavy into electronics. We have a couple game systems now and they usually only play them when they have friends over (which isn't often). Aside from their tablets, they rarely look at electronics/video games. So I vetoed this gift. 

My Mom thinks I'm being a grinch. She thinks I should buy the switch regardless because that's what my kids want. She even offered to put it under the tree from Santa if I couldn't afford it. 
I said no. Money is not the issue. 

Yesterday she informs me she bought my Dad a switch for christmas. I know this is just a cover. My Dad certainly didn't want/won't play with a switch. I asked her why she would get it for him and she says ""well if he doesn't like it, you can always take it home for the kids"". I told her no, she can just return it. She says I'm being ridiculous and to just accept it. I'm sticking to my guns refusing it. Now there is a rift between us over a stupid game system. 

So AITA for not buying/not wanting the game system?"
"AITA for getting bothered that my gf won't stop her 4 year old from coming to our bed and sleeping with us? | I have been living with my gf (28) for the last 4 months. Before that she had both her boys (7 & 4) sleep in the same bed as her even though they both have a room. I knew of this before I moved in so I told her to send them both to their room and get them use to sleeping there before I moved in. 

At first they both fought it but ultimate the 7 year old started sleeping in his own room and hasnt tried to sleep in our bed since. The 4 year old though is a whole different story. Every night/morning like clock work he's in our room. I work nights and when I get home around 5am there he is since our bed. Most days any gf refuses to send him back to his room or just says ""I'll take him in a bit"" and knocks out. 

Her excuse is ""he's my baby and soon he won't give me any attention"". I don't think that's a valid reason. I don't believe a 4 year old should be sleeping with us and I don't think I'm the asshole for bringing it up day after day causing an argument. 

P.s I'm writing this from the living room because guess who's in my bed right now. And she's waiting for him to ""knock out"" before taking him back even though he's snoring. I'm just gonna crash on the couch and trust me that's gonna be an argument. "
"AITA for calling my sister bitter bitch | I’m 17M. I have 3 sisters. 23-Lin, 28-Kim, 36-Bin(fake names).

 Bin lives at home. Lin and Kim live separately, Lin has a daughter(4) and Kim has 2 sons(6 and 10). They often visit(they haven’t visited for a while now because of the whole virus situation.) Because our parents want to spend time with their kids and grandkids. Bin HATES  this. She doesn’t like children. She “jokingly” called them brats, snots,goblins or something like that. Then basically everyone told her to stop, she complained for a while and stopped. 

Lin was facetiming with us while Bin was there. She told us that her and her husband were trying for another baby. We were all happy for her but Bin groaned and said that she already had to put up with 3 kids running around in HER house and told Lin that she was making a wrong choice and ruining her life.

I’ve had it and I told her that if she didn’t want children running around in “her” house she should actually act like a grown ass 36 year old, get a job and move away from mommy’s and daddy’s basement and stop being a bitter bitch. She didn’t say anything back but she’s not talking to me now(not that I’m bothered by it) but Lin said that I sounded kinda harsh and maybe I should apologize."
"AITA for texting another woman in front of my ex? | My ex (we'll call her Sarah) of over a year broke up with me about a month ago. She had her reasons, and I understood why it happened but it was still kind of out of the blue and it left me really hurt and insecure, and I made that clear to her. Recently, we've been talking again, and she mentioned she was driving up to my city (about 2 hours away from where she lives) for a hockey game. She wasn't going with anyone so I told her I would join her for old times sake, with the implication being that we were going as friends. I still have feelings for her and was going to try and use last night to rekindle something between us, but I've also been talking to other people since we broke up. So Sarah and I are at the game, and it's going fine, and I decide to take a picture of the view and send it to a female coworker who I have become friendly (read: just friends) with since our breakup. This is someone who Sarah is aware of and was jealous/insecure about while we were dating. I never really talked with this person outside of work while Sarah and I were dating, out of respect for Sarah, and I only got her number after we had broken up. But Sarah sees that I'm sending her a picture and she flips out and wouldn't talk to me and ended up leaving early. We've been texting since and she told me that was a dickheaded move by me to text this person in front of her. AITA?"
"WIBTA if I told my professor to stop pumping milk while shes meeting with students? | Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am not saying she can't pump! I just want her to not pump while meeting with a student.

Anyway, I have an instructor that is a new mother and every time I go to her office she is always pumping milk. I'm in a remedial freshman composition class so we need to go to her office to get our papers looked over. I need to visit her office 3 times a week which is already stressful and a waste of time. I think it's inappropriate to do that while meeting with a student. It's so strange she does that in front of a student.

Edit: its 2 more weeks of meeting with her for our final paper. I'll just suck it up. I won't say anything to her I really don't want her to give me a bad grade. I meet with her again today."
"AITA for being upset about my sister's baby name? | I'm posting this here because I'm genuinely curious and I've been feeling conflicted about it for quite some time. 

My husband and I had been married for about 7 years when this all went down, and obviously the fact that I'm posting this means it still gets my goat a few years later. 

So here's the story: husband and I were high school sweethearts, got married right out of high school. We didn't have kids right away, but we had a little list of our favorite names. There was one boy name on this list that was our #1, ""when we have a boy, this IS the name,"" kind of thing. Everyone knew. It wasn't a secret. 

So my little sister gets married about 6 years into our marriage, and gets pregnant right away. They find out it's a boy and they pick some random name. Cool. 

Well, then they decide to change it. To the name we've been hanging on to since we first started ever talking about having kids. The conversation goes something like this.

Sister: We decided we're not going to go with Todwyn (not the real name lol) for the baby's name
Me: Oh, ok. Cool. What are you doing instead?
Sister: We decided to change the name to *insert baby name here*
Me: Oh... You know we've been planning on using that name since we were in high school, right? 
Sister: I know. We just really like it and you don't have any kids, so....

At this point, I felt like I couldn't really say anything else. I cried to my other sister and she was sympathetic. My dad was unsympathetic and my mom was ambivalent. 

It's been a few years, and before and after that there have been some negative interactions that have definitely colored my feelings, so I'm really curious: AITA for 1. being upset in the first place? and 2. still feeling some resentment? 

I get it. It doesn't matter. What has me stung (still to this day tbh) is that she knew we loved that name and that we were planning on using it. I never, ever, EVER would have done that to her. If she'd been saying for 10 years, ""this is the name we're going to use for our first boy,"" I would have considered that name off-limits and never even considered it, so I'm hurt that she wouldn't do the same for me. Thoughts? Feel free to judge harshly.

EDIT: Not to make myself look better or anything, but there is definitely some bad blood between us from other issues as well. So it's not like I wanted to disown her for picking the baby name I liked. It's more like that was the cherry on top of a string of slaps to the face. lol

EDIT 2: I get that you can't really have ""dibs"" on a name, people. The issue is that my sister was mean and I'm hurt about it. Also, this wasn't 10 years ago. We've been together for like 10 years. This all went down about a year and a half ago.

EDIT 3: The name is James. And there's been no one in any of the families involved as far back as anyone can remember.

EDIT 4: “But James is such a common name.” I’ve LITERALLY been telling them for YEARS that it was the first name on our list! Obviously anyone could have come up with it. I never claimed it was an out-there name. I never should have told y’all the name itself because that’s not really the issue lol"
"AITA For lying to my GF | Been dating her for about 2.5 years. She has always had a problem with my son’s mother. Severe jealousy. It started when she went through my phone and saw that her (son’s mother) and I talk like we’re friends. Sending funny pictures back and forth, etc. (My son was 3 then, he’s about to be six now.)

I dial it back, because I reason while I see her as my son’s mother, my GF sees her an an ex. I can see where I could be wrong.

Some of her complaints are legitimate. Some of her complaints are unreasonable. It’s gotten to the point that I have a difficult time communicating with my son’s mother about anything because any amount of contact gets me a tremendous amount of grief. 

Last mother’s day I got some canvas picture frames made. One for my mom, one for my GF of her kid, and one for my son’s mother of our son. 

Being completely honest I was dreading my GF finding out that I did that. It’s something we used to do all the time. Christmas, birthdays, etc. We’d get each other a small gift “from our son.” Now, not so much. But mother’s day is specifically for having a kid, so I still wanted to.

However the place I had the canvas pictures made ran out of the smaller size I ordered, and upgraded one to a larger size. Which happened to be the one I was giving to my son’s mother. 

So I lied and I said I didn’t get my son’s mother anything. I knew she’d be upset at getting the same type of gift as her (it would make them equal in her eyes.) - if she saw that my son’s mother was larger she wouldn’t believe me and assume it was intentionally telling my son’s mother I still have feelings for her. 

Well last night it came out. We dropped my son off with his mom, and my son demanded my GF come up to the house so he could show her something in his. She wouldn’t normally be around my ex, but my son insisted. And she saw the canvas picture of my son hanging up from last Mother’s Day.

So last night I got the silent treatment. Going into this day. When I asked her to talk to me, she went off on me as expected. "
"AITA for not wanting to attend my husband’s niece’s baby shower? | I’ve met my husband’s (married 2yrs) ex niece-in-law all of twice, I think. Once when he DJ’d her wedding and once when she was in the bridal party of his adult son’s wedding -which I had nothing to do with. Hubby’s daughter dropped off a baby shower invite and I’m completely disinterested in hanging with a bunch of estrogen-based beings 20 years my junior and being around his ex wife. My guy is taking it personally. 

I told him if he wants to send her a baby shower gift, that’s fine, but these are not my peers and I have no interest in making them so. I don’t have kids and am not into babies or young children at all. His response was, “Well you’d be with my daughter and could get to know them.” 

My feeling: I have enough friends, peers, hobbies, events, and volunteer stuff that I’m already overwhelmed and just not interested. 

AITA?

Edit: Someone suggested I add additional detail from one of the comments about feeling superior/condescending, “No; the girls are fine; they’re just 20 years my junior. I just don’t want to hang out with the woman who fucked around on my husband for a decade behind his back or all of her family that knew it. Those aren’t people I choose to cultivate friendships with. If my tone comes across as condescending, that’d be why -more that I don’t want to hang with his ex wife. If it were coed of course, I’d go to support him. Maybe I can ask if it is.”

Edit 2 (final): Just wanted to thank everyone who gave helpful advice on how to handle better than just feeling like I *had* to attend. Hubby’s daughter just laughed and said, “That’s ok,” when I asked if the invite was coed, or more for her uncle and his niece just being polite to invite me. The invite is just for the women. I thanked her, saying, “I don’t know if I can get stuck with baby stuff; not my thing, but we’ll definitely get her a gift...” then checked my language and said, “Not *stuck* that sounds weird; I’m just not a babies person. I think the book idea is super cool. I will check out her registry, too. Gifts already on the way; thank you for forgiving me! We will also get a book, though.” So the gift is ordered and shipped, we get a book and will sign it, and the women in his family will deliver for us. Also, thanks for the tips on not using jargon with the public -yikes!

Edit 4: because requested: r/childfree"
"AITA for not telling my aunt about my uncle's mistress? | Okay. So this happened a couple of years ago. My uncle picked me up from the airport with a girl that he called his ""friend"". We went around doing a lot of things together. I was pretty suspicious, like, who in the world is this chick? I remember meeting her several years back when. I. was younger, but it was like one meeting and I. was younger. This time I was basically going. around the city. with her and my uncle and so I. was like...  is she a mistress?? That was all I could think about. We went to her apartment, she took me. to the salon, we went out to eat, she even was there in the morning when I was hospitalized at the ER to bring me breakfast O\_O!

&#x200B;

After a while, I finally. asked. my mom who was surprised that I didn't realize/ask sooner. She. confirmed my guess. Yes, that woman was my uncle's mistress.

&#x200B;

Now, I had very conflicting feelings about this. She treated me quite nicely, and so I did like her. My grandma likes her. My mom likes her too. And both my grandma and my mom insisted that I don't say anything at all to my aunt and not mention her at all when we talk. Because my mom was like your aunt will be furious and it's not your business etc., and that you shouldn't interfere with these things, basically. Now, I felt really. guilty, because I like my aunt and I think cheating is wrong. But I also thought the mistress was a nice person. And I didn't want to be someone who... ruins the peace, if. you. know what I mean. So in the end, my mom. convinced me, I didn't say anything, and went back home when the summer. was over. Next summer I didn't say anything either. plus, my mom does have a good point that it isn't my business...

&#x200B;

Idk, I occasionally still wonder if I'm. a terrible person for not saying anything, so I wanted to ask this. here. if you guys. think I am an asshole for not saying anything in the end.

&#x200B;

Some more background info: In China, mistresses are fairly common (so says my mom). My aunt and uncle have divorced once. (idk the reason, I think she said it was several years ago), but got back together (my mom said because the divorce didn't work out, idky). They have a son (older than my by three years and already graduated college). My. mom says my aunt and cousin probably have their suspicions, but no one says anything. The mistress is not allowed to have a child (I think if she did all. hell would break loose if it is a boy). My uncle lives in an apartment with his mistress, while my aunt and cousin live in a different apartment (I've actually been to both and slept in both...)

&#x200B;

It's my uncle who is two timing, so why does it feel like I'm the one who's two timing...? I feel like I'm living a double life whenever I visit, it's like straight out of some soap opera."
"AITA for giving up my boyfriend's seat for him on the train? | Throwaway.

My (21F) BF (23M) and I don't usually transit together as he has a car, but we were going downtown for a friend's birthday and were probably gonna get drunk so we took the train down instead of driving. I don't have a car so I transit all the time for school, work, etc - he doesn't as often as me. For the record, my BF is a healthy, able-bodied young man with a semi-physical job who runs a couple times a week. 

I don't normally sit down on the train because I just prefer to stand but my BF sat down and I sat with him. The train was pretty packed, though we weren't sitting in priority seating, all those seats were filled too and it looked like those occupying those seats needed them (pregnant woman, a couple elderly people etc from what I could tell).

An older man and his wife (60s?) got on the train a few stops after us. She had a cane and was leaning on him, though the man seemed alright. I got up and offered my seat and my BF's to them because the other priority seats were occupied and it looked like they needed them. They thanked me and took their spots. My BF and I stood the rest of the ride.

When we got off at our stop, my BF seemed mad at me. He said he didn't like that I offered up my seat for him, because it makes him look like an ass that he didn't do it, standing on the train sucks and he also doesn't like being volunteered for things.

I don't see the big deal. If the situation was reversed and he'd offered both our seats to someone who looked like they needed it more, I would be totally fine with it. AITA here?"
"AITA by not going crazy prepping for corona? | Update: went out to get the supplies, my car got crashed into, awesome.

My country got Corona Virus just confirmed and my mother has been going ballistic over buying food to store in case of curfew or something.

I've told her plenty of times: I ain't quitting my job, my father isn't quitting his, if we get it, she gonna get it.

My father and i are exposed to thousand of people every day.

We are all healthy so we shouldn't even worry about it too much. 

Still she is MAD that we ain't giving a fuck about contracting it.

Are we the assholes?

Edit: Not only are we all healthy, we got canned food, but she doesn't like sardines or canned beans or just 15 pounds of rice."
"WIBTA if I told my cousins to put their dog in a doggy daycare or something if I had to come over? | Sometimes I have to go to a cousin’s house an they have a *big* dog. No, I don’t have allergies or anything. In fact, normally I’m a dog person but this dog is different. I don’t know what its deal is but even after multiple times trying to connect with him, or professionals trying to train the dog, it will bark like hell, pee like crazy, and *try* to attack me on sight. It’s been like this for a long ass time. 

The final straw was when they decided they wanted the dog to like me (again, it’s been years and nothing). I had to go on a walk with my cousin, who would hold his leash. For the entire duration of the walk I would have to stand like 10 feet away from her because even after giving him dozens of treats he acts as if I had just murdered his owner in front of him.

After getting back to their house and doing a pathetic game of fetch with him (I would have to back out of sight before she let him chase after the ball), the dog seemed to cool down. I thought I may have been safe. So after I tossed him a treat (I have to give him treats from a distance or else he would bite me) he ran off his leash, ran straight to me barking like a maniac and attacked me. I couldn’t run away (because that dog is fast), and I knew I couldn’t kick it or anything or else I would be forever painted as the “bad guy”. After like 15 seconds of trying to avoid it they finally got ahold of his leash. And put him in his cage.

Afterwards, they said they wanted to try a few more things to make him more friendly but I said I had enough and waited in the car 

I don’t want to deal with him anymore, so WIBTA if I told them to put him somewhere if I had to come over for a family event or anything? I would be fine with paying a *piece* of the cost but I refuse to come over if that monster is still there. And no, a cage wouldn’t work. It even barks and shakes its cage a ton if I’m even on the same floor! Hell even if he knows I’m there he will bark.

TLDR: Cousin’s dog is incredibly aggressive to me and recently attacked me. I want them to put it in a daycare or something if I come over. WIBTA

Edit: I don’t know if this changes but almost every time I go to their place it’s not because I wanted to go, it’s because of either a family event or something that THEY wanted"
"AITA for telling off my girlfriends father this way? | So this happened last semester when I graduated and throwaway for privacy.

So last year end of semester I graduated and got my doctorates in chemistry and I was ecstatic  because well after all my hard work I got it.

Now when it happened I was so happy I had burst into tears (happy tears of course) and my girlfriends dad told me to ""stop it"" and ""man up men don't cry"" at that point I got mad and told him off telling him that since he dropped out of high school he has no room to talk and to honestly stfu and I yelled at him a little bit.

Well since then their entire family has now basically come to despise me for being disrespectful and at any gatherings I'm always told off about it and it pisses me off since I did what I felt in the moment i may have been harsh but I felt he was objectively rude so AITA?"
"AITA for not wanting to split the difference in mine and my sister's trust funds? | Full disclosure: IDK if trust fund is the right word. On the phone they asked if it was a trust fund or a child savings account, and I said I wasn't sure, so they used my name to find it instead.

I'm 21f, living with my mother, sister (18), and brother (14). I have a minimum wage job in a local pub and attend a nearby university. My student loan is a bit over 3 grand over the course of a year, in installments of approx 1.1k per 4 months. I pay rent by buying food for the house and paying the energy bill, as well as helping out when cash gets low and fixing up the house. My university course is over in May, and I plan on moving out this summer as I am starting a postgrad course in another part of the country in September.

My sister has a job, also minimum wage, working in a theme park. She is a full time worker when they are open, but it is only open seasonally, so she only works there for about 10 weeks total of a year. Minimum wage for her is also lower than it is for me (I think there's approx £1.50 difference?). Because this is her only income, she does not pay any rent. She is also a student but she is in sixth form, so she isn't eligible for student finance, and currently has no plans to attend university. She has no savings, and uses the money to go out with friends and buy stuff, and it is usually spent within a week.

Mum set up trust funds for all 3 of us when we were born. When I turned 18 I was told to call them but forgot, so the money has sat there, untouched, for 3 years. My sister turned 18 recently, the company managing the accounts contacted my mum and said that all 3 kids have accounts with them, so we should call and tell them what we want to do.

My sister's account contains about 2.1k. My account contains about 3.8k. We've both opted to close the accounts and withdraw the full amount.

The money has been invested in various things by the people managing the accounts for the first 18 years, but both accounts have been untouched since we turned 18. I checked and the exact same amount of money from mum went in, but it looks like my account had a series of good investments while my sister's did go up in value, but not to the extent mine did. Mum estimates about a grand went into each.

My mum and sister feel like we should even it up, as it only happened through luck and it's all because of mum's money, plus as the one with a job that isn't seasonal that pays more, I have savings already while my sister does not. However, I feel that as I will be moving out in a matter of months it would be just plain stupid of me to willing give up about a grand of money. Mum and sister are really annoyed at me, and both are guilt tripping me. It's not like it's life changing money but when I get to my new university I'll need to get a new job and this money will take a bit of pressure off and will save my boyfriend from potentially having to make up the rent I can't pay.

AITA for not wanting to split it evenly?

Info: my account stopped accruing interest or being invested further the day I turned 18, so the amount coming is the exact same as the amount that was there 3 years ago. They gave us the options of totally withdrawing everything and closing the account, withdrawing part and investing the rest, and investing everything. We both chose to withdraw the full amount(s).

I already have about £2k in savings but estimated cost of living per month in the place I'm moving to is about a grand per month, which I'll be splitting 50-50 with my boyfriend, and I should get a slightly higher student finance amount as I won't be living at home, but I don't have a job lined up and can't start applying for at least a couple months, all the places we're looking at are unfurnished, and right now I'm having to assume that I'll have a period of time immediately after the move where I have no income whatsoever and could struggle to find work with my university schedule, which is meant to be fairly intense.

Our brother's account is still being invested in various things and right now has around 1.3k, but this is subject to change.

Clarifying because I think some people have confused the amounts: my sister has two thousand and one hundred and something, I have three thousand eight hundred and something. Not twenty-one and thirty-eight thousand. We're talking a few months rent here, not paying off my student loans."
"Aita for not talking to my friend after she told me she didn’t want a relationship then got a boyfriend weeks later? | Let me preface this by saying that I am good friends with this person now, and we just have to work some stuff out and i just need to know where i need to come from

I’ve been best friends with this girl for about 5 years now and have liked her on and off for about 3, i was always very open and told her that i liked her but she never felt the same way. A few months ago she started getting really flirty with me and even laid on my shoulder and even my lap a few times. 

Naturally I got feelings for her again and told her, this time a bit more flirtatiously. This time the feelings were mutual and we starter talking, not officially dating.

For about a month we talk from dawn till like 4 in the morning every night. We didn’t see each other very much but when we did we were very affectionate. 

A month later almost to the day, she told me she didn’t want to be in a relationship anymore, which I knew had been coming cause she was acting very distant through the couple days leading up to that.

I told her i needed some space and then didn’t talk to her much after that, but still hung out with her when we were together. 

Then I learned from a mutual friend that she had gotten a boyfriend mere weeks after we “broke up” (i say broke up cause we were never officially dating but pretty much) when i learned that I completely stopped talking to her.

A month of not talking at all she came to me, crying, and told me that she missed me, I told her that we could still be friends but it wouldn’t be the way it was before. So i went back to avoid her when we were together and only talking to her over text and sparingly at that.

This went on for a while until one night she called me, crying, and told me that she wanted to be best friends again and told me that i needed to stop being an asshole.

So reddit, am i in the wrong?

Edit: I later learned from her, that she had tried to feel the same way towards me and thought that if she faked feelings she would eventually get feelings.

Edit 2: thank you guys for your input, i know i knoda suck at giving out alot of info but I think I’ve come to the conclusion that no one is in the wrong and it’s just a sucky situation, this will really help.

Edit 3: a lot of you have said “I don’t want to be in a relationship - with you” and to that i have to say that i would understand that if it wasn’t so out of the blue and if we hadn’t been hardcore flirting 15 hours a day for a month

Edit 4: since this blew up and is still blowing up (thanks for the support and advice everyone) i won’t be responding to any arguments I haven’t heard. If you say I’m TA cause I’m a nice guy please read over the post and look up the definition of nice guy, I have a lot of female friends and i love and respect them all and I’m nice to them, but not for a relationship just because I respect them. I would also like to remind you that i TOLD HER I NEEDED A BREAK and that i did not ghost her."
"AITA for telling a woman she should lose weight? | So the story starts out in one of my classes, we are working on an essay about describing the process of doing something. You can choose any topic you want eg how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 

This is where the interesting part happens, one of my friends in class was asking for good ideas for his paper. a few suggestions are made but then a female student says he should do his essay on how to grow teeth. you might be wondering why this is a big deal, this friend of mine had an accident a few years back and lost some teeth that he has yet to get fixed.

This is where i may have fucked up, I get quite heated in this moment knowing that he can’t just grow his teeth back. I know that this probably was not my place to jump in but it was an in the moment decision and i said “maybe you should do yours on how to lose weight”. 

Nobody in the class said a word after she insulted him for something he can not change but when I insult her back over something she can, everyone flips their shit at me. Every female in class was attacking me for saying what I said and demanded I apologize. I just kept my head down and focused on my work.

What do you guys think? My thought on the matter is that he could have defended himself but I could see in his eyes he was really crushed by what she said, he was just in shock and couldn’t respond. So it most likely was not my place to jump into the conversation but I think the fact that people are more defensive of a person because they are female is a little unfair. Also for anyone saying this isn’t a gender thing, it clearly was, the defense that most of people used to defend her was that “You don’t talk about a woman’s weight”. She can change her weight, he can’t change his teeth.

TLDR: Female said good friend of mine had bad teeth, i retaliated for him by saying she was overweight."
"AITA For giving my opinion on girls who post their nudes on discord | Posting this on a throwaway

I'm a member of an adult discord that has adult channels where people can post their own nudes, I was invited by a friend who reassured me that the server actually has a good community and not just thirsty horny guys looking for nudes.

 I joined and immediately made some cool friends, one of which was a girl who seemed to develop feelings for me after a month of talking, She realized I lived in the same state and thought this could be something irl, One little fact about this girl is she's 1 of the girls who frequently post her nudes in the adult channels, If you do that then go ahead but I can't go out with somebody who does that.

 One day, a group of us were just chilling in voice chat talking and she was part of the group, I'm guessing she wanted to get my opinion on people who post nudes but didnt wanna make it obvious she was asking to see if i was cool with her doing it of we went out, (This was before I knew she posted nudes)
She asks me ""What's your opinion on people who post their nudes on discord servers? Could you go out with somebody who did that?""
I kept it honest
""It's their bodies so they can do what they want but i couldnt go out with them, I view the body as something private and intimate the share only be seen by the SO, Not a bunch of horny 18 year olds on discord""

Once I said this, she went quiet and left the call but I chalked it up to a bad connection and kept talking to the other friends

 Like 3 days goes by and I have a friend of hers in my dm trying to tear me a new ass hole
 Calling me Petty and insecure.
 Saying only a coward would refuse to go out with somebody because they post their nudes
 
I asked her what she was talking about

  She told me that my friend was upset and heartbroken upon learning my opinion on girls who share their nudes because she had feelings for me but she gained a certain confidence from posting her nudes.

 I said ""for one I think it's reasonable to not want people jerking off to naked pictures of my girlfriend. 

2. I didn't know she liked me and i didn't know she posted her nudes, If she wants to post them then fine but don't get mad at me just because I don't wanna go out with someone who does that, I think I'm entitled to an opinion and choosing who I do and don't wanna go out with for whatever reason""

 Technically I never rejected her as she never asked me out

Half of my friends think it's a reasonable opinion while others think it's a stupid reason not to go out with somebody and think I'm an ass hole and I broke her heart over something stupid

 I stand firm on my belief but I want to get an outsider's opinion

AITA?
Edit: I never said I disproved, I literally said it's their bodies and they can do what they want but I just can't date somebody who does that

Edit 2: The community isn't meant to be a place based around posting nudes, it's supposed to be meant as a place for adults so socialize with other adults without worrying about 13 year olds lurking

It just so happens to have nude channels"
"AITA for not paying for my daughter's tuition after she cheated on her bf? | my daughter had a bf for 3 years who i became really close with he was basically part of the family. My daughter is off to graduate school and i told her i'd pay for her university tuition but then i found out she's breaking up with her bf because she cheated on him with some rich rich saudi exchange student. He promised to take her to Riyadh Dubai for a week of luxurious vacationing but of course he left her. She went crying back to bf who left her.

Im honestly on the bf's side. My daughter fucked up and I've decided that I'm not going to pay for her tuition. Im heartbroken my daughter could do something so degenerate. My wife is really pissed at me for ""siding with the bf"" and not taking pity on her. Should i still pay for my daughter's tuition? my wife and daughter are upset that i haven't cut ties with the bf and i still occasionally hang out with him going fishing and hunting.

EDIT: thank you for your advice and i realize that i fucked up. I will amend my ways"
"WIBTA for not allowing my mother’s boyfriend at my wedding? | TLDR: I despise my mother’s boyfriend who has not treated me well and do not want him in attendance at my wedding. WIBTA for not allowing my mother to bring him? 

Basic backstory is that my mother and father separated when I was around 12 and have both since found new relationships. It wasn’t the messiest divorce, but by no means was it amicable and I was very angry for how it went down, especially in regards to my mother, for quite a few years. 

At this point, I’m 21 and have a wonderful boyfriend that I’ve been with for over a year. We’re living together in his country while I do university here and it’s been going well. We‘re not engaged, but we’ve spoken about it and it’s just a matter of when (I’m not pressuring him).

I despise my mothers boyfriend. My mother didnt handle a new relationship with this person and her children well. She moved him into our house without any regard for my or my sister’s feelings. We were just ambushed one day and told that he and his disabled mother were moving in. I admit that at first he attempted to form some sort of relationship with me, but when I didn’t bite, it became mutual ignorance. He then began to erase every semblance of my father from that house. He destroyed our pool, he turned my sandbox into a pit for his cigarettes, he painted over the mural that my father painted for me, etc. 

I never left my bedroom because I was so uncomfortable in the house and barely spoke to my
mom. The only time I got with my mother was when we would watch this one show every week. Once when we were watching this show, he came in, grabbed the remote from me, and told me about how I was such a terrible child who didn’t respect my mother or him and I needed to get my act together and then threw the remote and stormed out. I never again watched that show with my mother. 

After I went to university, things got a bit better with my mom and I worked on forging a relationship with her that didn’t involve him. And things are better now. We hang out and talk and I’m happy to have her in my life. But I will not go to anything if he is involved. To be honest, I don’t really care if she feels bad for having to pick me or him because I was never picked when I needed her when I was younger. She says I don’t want her to be happy, but I believe that incredibly selfish to say and I don’t want to deal with it. 

Anyway, here’s the basic question. I told my boyfriend that my mother could not come with him to our wedding. He doesn’t think that’s fair to her as he’s in a very similar situation with his mother and her boyfriend and that I should want my mother there no matter what. He tolerates her boyfriend and speaks to him because he loves his mother so much, but he doesn’t like him. I don’t want that. I don’t want to feel this hate inside me when I’m supposed to be my happiest. So WIBTA for only allowing my mother to come without him? "
"AITA for breaking a patient's confidentiality to tell my friend that her boyfriend is HIV+? | This has been eating me up inside for the past week, so I'm going to lay it all out here.

One of my closest friends (Amanda) started dating a guy (Matt) about 2 months ago. I'd met him twice before and he seemed pretty seedy to me, but she was happy so overall I was happy for them. 

I work at our local hospital. I won't divulge too much about my role, but I am not involved in providing medical care (i.e. I am not a physician or nurse), but I do have access to patient records and am permitted to look through them under certain circumstances with ethics approval.

I came across Matt's chart just over a week ago. I was **not** snooping, I was explicitly gathering patient information for an approved task and he was one of the patients in the pile of charts. It's not too much of a coincidence - I was going through ~500 patient records, and this is the only nearby hospital.

I discovered that Matt was HIV+ from his chart. I was unsure whether Amanda was aware. I wrestled with this in many different directions: Should I mind my own business and not violate confidentiality and risk her contracting the disease? Should I approach him first - even though it's not my place and we've only met twice? Should I go straight to her just to confirm that she knows?

Ultimately I felt an obligation to her as my friend, and to her well-being, so I told her. Knowing her, I felt like she was unaware since she is generally extremely risk-averse and something seemed off about this guy, so I felt like approaching him might not accomplish anything. She was shocked to find out about his HIV status, and broke up with him.

Amanda was thankful to me, but evidently she let him know how she found out, as I was let go from my position two days ago. I understood the risk I was taking, and was hoping it was a calculated risk, but now I'm wondering if I overstepped by breaking confidentiality.

AITA?

EDIT: To be clear, confidentiality isn't something I take lightly. In my 8 years in this position, I have never once broken confidentiality. This is something I really wrestled with internally before deciding to come forward to Amanda"
"AITA for getting upset at my wife for being too controlling? | If my wife wants to watch a movie I don't like or listen to a song on the radio I don't care for,  I just roll with it.  I don't say anything and let her enjoy it.  Her parents are staying over often because they are helping with the baby while Im at work.  We just got Disney plus free for a year so I have been rewatching the Star Wars movies that I haven't seen in 10 years. This morning when I was in the living room alone she told me that I was ""outvoted"" and had to watch star wars when no one else was in the house because they don't like it. I can't listen to Eminem with her in the car either. I blew up at her and it ruined the day and her parents think im crazy.  I let her watch whatever trashy Kristen Bell chick flick movies she wants but she has no problem telling me what I can and can't do in my house.

Edit: I finished watching the movies on my own a week or two earlier.  I wasn't planning on watching them. It was just a pre-emptive warning that Star Wars wasn't allowed in the house with her and her parents.

Edit 2: The baby is a year old.  Her parents come around to help when Im away on work assignments."
"AITA for re-wearing underwear that my ex purchased for me? | Simple one.

I was clearing out some boxes of my stuff from my parents home last week and amongst my clothing, found a bag filled with very expensive Agent Provacatuer lingerie. My ex was a big fan of seeing me in these so bought me many sets.I don't really wear expensive lingerie these days and usually go braless but decided to take them home with me to surprise my current boyfriend. I thought he would appreciate the novelty.

After he got over the shock and of course, the inevitable happening, he asked me if I had spent all our savings on lingerie worth £1000 but was really angry to find out my ex bought me it and has asked me to get rid of it. He wants it gone.

I don't want to. I look good in it and it's not like it reminds me of my ex. Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for leaving a decoy test in public to deter cheating? | I work in a university as an associate professor. 

Last year for this course I am teaching, one of my students stole a midterm before it was issued. They asked the secretary to open my door because they left something in there when they spoke to me, and he or she snooped through my things and found the exam. I noticed right away and had to write a new exam (this takes me approximately 10 hours). The fate of the secretary is not important but I can say a lot of people failed that exam because presumably they studied only the (wrong) exam.

This year I decided to play a joke/trick on my students. I purposefully left a (wrong) exam in one of the computer labs. I did tell my students earlier in the semester of what happened last year, so maybe they get the hint that cheating doesn't win. I teach a first year course so this is a good learning experience: if you cheat, you lose. If a student found my (wrong) exam, shared it around, and people studied for only that exam, they deserve to fail.

I told my TAs what I did and they compared it to entrapment. I disagree: I am giving the opportunity to learn from a lapse in judgment. It's not like the midterm is worth much anyways. AITA?"
"AITA? Had Ham for Thanksgiving and Xmas for the last five years. I wanted Turkey this year, they brought thier own ham. | I make the main course and dessert for the inlaws on holidays. For 5 years all they wanted was ham. I would suggest Turkey for at least one of the holidays and they would strike it down. This Thanksgiving I said fuck it, I am going to convert these people to at least have a turkey every other year. I made an awesome turkey, it was moist and flavorful, I thought for sure this would change thier minds. They brought ham to the dinner and put it on thier kids plates and ate that. When I saw the ham i said ""ya'll are fucking ridiculous "". Nobody got mad and I didn't sulk (out loud anyway). I was kind of offended by it. Just wanting to know if I'm an asshole for telling them that they are ridiculous.
Edit: Thanks for all the responses,  looks like I'm an asshole but I'm ok with it. I told them they were ridiculous in a laughing manner. Picky eaters are my pet peeve. Also don't think this is so deep. I don't take anything to seriously. "
"AITA for not talking to my ex co-workers because they all forgot when my last day was? | I worked in a tight knit pharmacy for a big Midwest chain store for 3 years. I got along with everyone. People actually liked working with me for some reason. For my last year there I had to cut back to part time because I was finishing my masters. My last day of work was a Saturday and I had been telling everyone 'this is my last month', 'this is my last week', 'last time I'll see our weekly stats'. So that Saturday comes around I show up to work as usual and it's just another day. The openers go to leave, see you tomorrow, and I say 'nope, last day I'll see you never.' They all just kind of stare at me; bewildered. 'I didn't know that', 'When did this happen?'. Even the pharmacist didn't know. The rest of that day I was so depressed I hid in the bathroom every half hour because I was in tears. I waited until the end of the day to 'pass judgement' and no one came around to say goodbye. There wasn't even a card. When I got home I decided that I wouldn't talk to them after that because they made it clear that I wasn't even significant enough to remember to put together a goodbye card.

A week after that the head pharmacist asked me to come in because they wanted to give me something. I straight up told her that pharmacy makes me feel sick because they all forgot about me and my last day and I didn't want to go back for anything.

To add to this, there's a total of 10 people that work there. Everytime an employee passed through, even the interns that were there for a week, they at least put together a card. So I personally felt insulted when one of the pharmacists who's there full-time forgot about my last day.

EDIT: to be clear, what the pharmacist wanted to give me was the copy of my license they kept on the wall, not a gift.

EDIT: Jesus I didn't think people would care at all. Let me clarify some things: we regularly hung out after work before I went for my masters. They regularly said I was a close friend outside of work. I worked my ass off every minute I was there. And I get it, me crying in the stalls is childish, but I felt heartbroken for being forgotten after three years. I couldn't help it. They just happened. But I kept hiding because I didn't want to cry in front of customers or my coworkers. And again, there was never a gift, they just wanted to give me a copy of my license that they had. I reduced my hours over the course of a year. My expectation for my last day was a farewell. No party, no potluck. 

I apologized to my pharmacist today and she apologized for forgetting about it. All the full timers were at a weekend party and forgot."
"AITA for rage quitting on my boss? | I have been working as a Legal Assistant with a law firm for just over six years and walked off the job yesterday in a fit of a rage.  For these six years, it has been a wonderful relationship -- my employer is a solo practitioner and I was his first and only Legal Assistant until yesterday's events.

My employer recently hired a new Associate who took it upon herself to treat me like absolute shit.  As a Legal Assistant, my duties are LEGAL related, ie; editing and drafting documents, calendar management, processing client payments, filing documents at court, phone coverage, etc.  However, the new Associate assigned me her PERSONAL duties:  Grocery shopping, driving across town in traffic to buy her favorite chocolates, making returns to clothing stores, driving to her house to let maintenance technicians in, etc.  She yelled at me a lot.  I would get panic attacks and dreaded coming in to work.  I would have no problem performing these duties if I was a PERSONAL Assistant, but I am a LEGAL Assistant and my objective is to ensure everyone in my firm has their LEGAL responsibilities in order.

At first I obliged, seeing as she was new and I figured my employer would have a word with her.  This went on for two months and every day I grew that much more resentful.  Finally, I had a private meeting with my supervisor a few weeks ago and even typed up a note detailing my frustrations and how I am being taken advantage of.  He promised me he would speak with her, but her demands continued.

Yesterday was the last straw; While working at my desk, I overheard her talking about me to our Receptionist.  She wasn't exactly pleasant - stating how I'm not up to par with her standards and how she spoke to my boss about me.  She was telling our Receptionist how much they pay me and said she wants to lower my pay.  My blood started boiling and I could feel myself about to lose my shit.

I have no idea what came over me, but I walked to over to our filing cabinet, pulled out all of our folders, and dumped all of their contents to the floor.  I imagine it was about 40-50 clients worth of papers.  I then grabbed my things and walked out of the office before telling the Associate ""Go fuck yourself, you stupid bitch.""  She was absolutely shocked.

On my home, I was seething.  Still pissed off when I got home, I texted my boss saying I will not be returning to work Monday and that he'll have to find himself another Assistant.  Both her and she have tried calling, texting, and e-mailing me, but I haven't responded, except for one text where I sent her the middle finger emoji.  

This morning I felt a twinge of guilt, as I know it was HER that made me miserable and not him .. but then again, there was no loyalty there.  Fuck you Sweta, I hate you!"
"AITA for telling a woman to fuck off on the train in front of her young son after she insinuated I had a bomb in my bag? | I’m getting a lot of mixed responses from people I know like the people agreeing with me are saying good she deserves it for assuming I was some sort of terrorist and some people said I went too far by swearing that vulgarly in front of her young son who was next to her.

The whole thing started when I’m sitting on an empty train with my bag on the floor between my legs and a little boy runs through the door in to the train and sits next to me. He ran in to the train because his mother didn’t follow him in the train immediately after for about 10 seconds. This is important because that means that she didn’t choose to sit next to me on this empty carriage but she just sat where her son sat.

The train is about to depart in 10 minutes and the woman is sitting next to her son who’s sitting next to me until she says “Sweetie,get away from there, it’s dangerous,sit over here”, I instantly shift my eyes across in the ‘what the fuck?’ kind of way and she notices and says again “I’m trying to protect my son, we don’t know what you are carrying or what you’re planning”.

I still hadn’t said anything at that point but at this time I was squinting my eyes and and staring in confusion like what the fuck is wrong with you. About 15 seconds later, there is a normal train message that plays that says “If you see anything suspicious, report to the London Transport police”. She rolls her head to me as I can see in the corner of my eye since I’m just daydreaming straight ahead. I lost it.

I shouted at her “Fuck off you stupid bitch” and I remember the kid being scared and having his mouth hanging open but I picked up my bag and went to the next carriage but before that and while passing her and her son, I then muttered “Cunt” which they both heard but I used awful language because I had been racially profiled and antagonised so AITA for the obscene language or not because I do think the language was too much especially in front of a child but the situation was very serious to me."
"AITA - If I cut my SO off financially? | This is a bit confusing for me but I made a throwaway cause I need a bit of guidance and SO is an avid redditor (even on AITA), TL,DR at bottom. Also on mobile.

I have 2 kids, SO has 1. I work ALOT, like a whole lot. About a year after my divorce I met someone (SO) and we instantly clicked we ended up living together and I support them primarily (their child is too young for school sp they cant work, SO shares custody with their ex) I'm fine with this as I don't see any other option. They get a pension from the government (they lie to the government about being single to get it... you could call it a single parent pension) and contribute nothing if it to the household, bar one off payments like rent when I was short or maybe some food or cloths for the kids once in a while I make an effort to reimburse whatever SO spends on my kids to them as I don't see it fit for them to spend money on my kids tbh.

Anyway so we did a budget a few months ago and it turns put that the pension they get spent even cover enough for them to buy food and entertain their child for 2 weeks so we agreed that I would supplement it by about 50% meaning they now have 1.5x as much coming in as they did. This is all fine except for 1 thing. The child support paid by SO's EX.. the EX dissent like the system and thinks it's better to use a different route I won't go.into details about that but suffice to say it doesn't support their child sufficiently.. (think it isnt feasable because there is no felxability on how and when it can be used.. kinda like paying child support in food stamp form)

Now back to the working alot part. I work in a mine in NSW Australia and I work alot 4 weeks on 1 week off, so I can fully appreciate working hard for your money and not wanting to get exploited but I am currently supporting my 2 kids my SO AND their child all while SO's EX doesn't really contribute to their child's financial situation in our house. I'm feeling very abused and not respected me and SO have had fights about this before and nothing changes or comes of it. They are afraid to rock the boat with the EX, no idea why but they won't do anything to change this and would rather just do what the EX wants to do re:child support.

I can't help but think fuck this, no.money for you or your child until you come to a compromise that works for US not just your EX cause WE are supposed to be working together. Then I instantly think how are they going to be able to afford anything... they already can't ... It's a shit situation that I think I have caused to a large extent. But now I'm nearly at breaking point and I don't know if I can keep going with this... should I cut off my SO? WIBTA if I do? You decide.

TL,DR: SO dosent contribute to the household even though they get money for losing to the government, I'm stuck supporting SO and their  hold cause they won't stand up to their ex about child support issues. Should I just cut them off financially?

Thanks reddit"
"AITA for loudly heckling cat-callers? | This is something I've been in the habit of doing for like two months now, ever since moving to a big city. Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. 

Anyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly ""*booo!*"" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. 

Basically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. 

Thanks!

edit: Big-huge thanks to everyone whose weighed in here. Majorly helpful to get some well-reasoned, outside perspectives on this behavior. I think I've got my head on straight about it now."
"WIBTA if I told my friend his deceased ex wanted to dump him? | I judge on here often so I figured I’d put my sticky situation on here:

I (25M) have a good friend, Mason, (26M). I was his roommate in college. He met this girl, Kelly, during our freshman year and they began dating. Being Mason’s roommate and friend, I became close with Kelly too. They stayed together throughout all 4 years of college and continued dating after graduation. Super cute couple. Was proud of them in a weird way.

After graduation, we all got jobs in the same city and lived near each other. One day, Kelly (22 at the time), confided in me and basically said that while she liked Mason a lot, she was less happy than before, and wasn’t sure if she should be tied down so young. Kelly talked through her feelings with me, and concluded that she was going to break up with Mason. Meanwhile, Mason told me a week prior that he’s never been happier and was even thinking of proposing. I told Kelly this during our chat and she made her decision with this in mind.

I sat around fearing the pending fallout between my two close friends when I received horrible news. As you saw coming from the title of this post, Kelly never got the chance to tell Mason how she felt. She died in a car accident the same day she told me her decision to dump Mason.

Mason grieved, and grieved hard. I never told him about me and Kelly’s convo. Two years later and after lots of therapy and such, he’s much better, though far from perfect. Nowadays, Mason tells me that he’s discovered that love is the most important thing to him in life and that he aspires to marry. He tried dating over the past half year, but always ends up saying that “I’m confident that no girl will ever love me the same way Kelly did. This is pointless.” At this point, he’s pretty much given up on dating and is becoming more depressed.

By now I think you can sense my dilemma: should I tell Mason about Kelly and I’s conversation? Maybe it’ll help him realize he can find a better match for himself and that his views on his old relationship are romanticized and not good for his future.

On the other hand, I’m not sure if it will make much of a difference other than me breaking his heart even further and harming his grieving process. Maybe it would be better off to just let him continue the hard work he’s put in to heal so far and let him continue his healing without my interference. I’m also not sure what it will do to our friendship: I’ve sat on this info for a long ass time now. 

WIBTA if I told him???

Edit: just for clarity due to some comments, it’s not like dropping this would be the first thing I tried to help him. I’ve encouraged he talks to his therapist about comparing other girls to Kelly, he’s talked to me about it, I’ve been a general comforting friend through this all, etc."
"AITA for taking back my car? |  So I used to live in Texas with some very good friends as roommates. About 8 months ago, I got a amazing job offer in Washington, DC. I had just graduated college and it was a job in my field and payed literally three times as much as I was making. I took it. I made an arrangement with my roommates to make sure I didn't leave them high and dry. All that worked out just fine, and we are still very good friends.

Here's where it gets sticky. I had this car that didn't run that I had to leave there. I didn't have time to deal with it because it broke down about 3 days before I was set to fly out for my new job. I told my friends if they dealt with it, whatever the end result was was theirs to keep. Fix it and keep it, scrap it for cash, don't care. They agreed.

So part of the deal of trying to ease the burden on my roommates from me leaving was that one of my roommate's (we'll call her S) brother (N) was going to move into my old room and pick up the rent I was paying. He did, and that worked out for a few months. About 6 months into this, N starts fixing up the car without consulting anyone about it, myself included. Apparently he managed to get it to work, because one day N was just... gone. And so was the car. Now, keep in mind, I haven't transferred the title to my roommates name yet, so the car is still legally mine, even though I have a verbal agreement with S about it.

S tells me N took off with the car, and skipped on about $600 worth of rent too. So a few days later, N messages me and asks if he can keep the car... that he just stole from me. ""I fixed it and you didn't want it anyway."" He says. I tell him no, take it back to S, I'm giving it to her. I assumed that would be the end of it, right? At this point I have a lot of big deadlines at work and some other family issues I'm dealing with so I kind of just forget about it for a couple months.

Fast forward to the holidays. I come to visit S and and her husband, who now just pay the rent themselves. We have a few to drink, so I stay the night. I wake up to a knock on the door, and its a cop. Asking for ME. Officer says a car registered in my name was pulled over in association with a report of people peeking inside of cars in the neighborhood. Thankfully, I wasn't a suspect, because I wasn't driving my car. N was. The officer then asks if N was supposed to have my car. I told him no. He says, ""Well, I know where it is. Wanna go get it?"" Yes. Yes I do. So we hop in the cop's car, and drive to a house a few blocks away, and lo and behold, there she sits. With the trunk nice and smashed in as an added bonus. The officer goes to the door, and makes N return the keys and the car and escorts me back to the house with them. I then gave the car and the keys back to S, because that was the agreement we had.

A few days later, S and I start getting nasty messages from N and N's friends saying we ruined his life because he lost his job because he can't get to work now.

Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for wearing an ""edgy"" shirt for autism awareness? | I go to a school that has a uniform (polo and khakis). We have fundraisers where you can pay a couple dollars to “normal clothes,” such as jeans or t-shirts.

My little sister has autism so my mom thought it would be nice if we did a blue shirt day to support a local non-profit in support of it. She asked me if I would be willing to organize it with our headmaster, which I obliged. 

The day before the fundraiser I went to set out my clothes for the next day. I grabbed one of my few blue shirts, a shirt from Hot Topic that says “I’m dead inside” surrounded by dolphins, sunshine, and pastel colors. ([https://www.hottopic.com/product/dead-inside-t-shirt/10817915.html](https://www.hottopic.com/product/dead-inside-t-shirt/10817915.html)) 

I asked my dad if it was blue just to make sure (it looked kind of white to me). He told me it was but asked me said he thought I was going to wear my mom’s shirt which had the name of the nonprofit on it. I told him it was too big and that was the end of the conversation.

Fast-forward to the next morning when my mom walks out and sees me wearing it. She starts berating me, saying that I’m just trying to “show my ass” and “make light of autism.” I didn’t expect her to act like this as she has never taken issue with the shirt before. I tried to explain that it was only a shirt, but she went on to say “I don’t care about my sister” and that it was a “really offensive thing for me to do.” I offered to change into a different shirt or polo, but was instead grounded. I did change before I left the house anyway so as not to offend anyone else but I don’t see what the problem was since everyone else wore normal blue t-shirts as well. 

So, AITA for wearing an “edgy” shirt in support of autism? 

tl;dr: i wore an “I’m dead inside” shirt on my school’s blue shirt day for $2 to support autism and my mom found it offensive"
"AITA: I might have ruined my Uncles proposal and potentially a good Christmas | So I’ll start by saying my uncle is happily engaged now to his financée. 

Today I’m staying at my girlfriends families house for Christmas Eve. This morning I was watching a movie with her family while my girlfriend was at work. I haven’t always been able to bond with her family like this so I was quite excited to be hanging out with them without my girlfriend needing to be around. 

The rest of my family is staying at my grandparents house which includes my mother, step dad, uncle, uncles now financée, grandma and grandpa. 

Halfway through the movie I get a FaceTime call from my uncle. Which is kind of odd but I didn’t wanna be rude and answer a FaceTime call in the middle of the movie we were enjoying. So I ignore it and he FaceTimes me again. At this point I’m thinking oh it’s probably some Christmas gag he’s put together, so I text him saying “what’s up?” He just FaceTimes me again. So I text my mother who’s also there saying “what’s going on? I don’t wanna be rude and interrupt the movie” Nobody would tell me what’s going on, which made me believe it wasn’t some sort of emergency just something silly that they wanted to fill me in on. If it was an emergency I know my mom would call me to tell me so. 

At this point my uncle has tried FaceTiming me 5 times and I’m getting annoyed so I texted my mother saying “I’ll call you later I’m turning my phone off”. So I turn my phone on airplane mode. 

 About half an hour later and the movie being done I got up to call my mom. And she yelled at me for being selfish and how I ruined such a great thing. And again nobody has actually told me what is going and and all I know is that I’ve ruined some sort of gag that my uncle put together. 

Shortly after my uncle called me to tell me he’s now engaged to his partner. And he was trying to FaceTime me so I could watch the proposal. 

I can accept that I could have stepped out of the room to take the call. But I was happily enjoying a movie and some bonding time with my girlfriends family. Just sucks that I was given absolutely no heads up as to what was going on. 

It’s shitty all around I can accept that, I just now feel like a mega asshole. Most of the family texted me saying how selfish I was for not picking up the phone and that I made it all about me. 



TLDR: My uncle was trying to FaceTime me so I could watch him propose to his girlfriend while I was missing the family get together. Me not knowing that anything was going on told him I’d call him later."
"WIBTA If I told my daughter not to use my disability for her college scholarships and essays? | My daughter is going to be a senior in high school this fall and has already starting looking at scholarships and planning out her admission essays. She has a Google Doc shared with me with potential scholarships and ideas for her essays. One of the essay prompts is the classic ""What's a challenge you faced in your life and how did you overcome it?"" For that her idea is to write about her deaf father, me.  

I've been deaf since birth. I have a cochlear implant that allows me to hear, but when I don't have my hearing aid (swimming, showering, any thing with water basically) or when the battery dies then I'm essentially completely deaf. I've had the C.I. for my daughter's whole life. Without it I can still read lips pretty well and know ASL. My daughter knows enough ASL to get by (basic words and the alphabet in case she needs to spell something she doesn't know the sign for)

But looking at her Google Doc I don't like how she'd be using my disability for scholarships and essays. It's something kinda personal to me that I can't really explain very well. I know and recognize that it's affected her too though and I obviously do want her to get scholarships and admitted to college. 

So, WIBTA if I told my daughter not to write about my deafness for scholarships and admission essays?"
"AITA for Talking Too Much | My (47f) boyfriend (40m) and I have been together just over 3 years. He is very close to his parents (as am I now). Things have been a little rocky between us lately but we're both committed to making our relationship work. We love each other very much. 

I've noticed that we haven't spent as time with his parents the past few weeks (we normally see them 3x a week/ish) and yesterday I told him that I felt like his mom has been acting ""strange"" with me the past couple of times I've seen her.  He proceeded to tell me that she was upset because I ""tell too many stories"" that I ""have a story for everything and I need to stop it"". It really hit me super hard and I am so incredibly hurt by this. I am a writer and a very language based person. I love to talk and share and listen to others. I had no idea that something inherent to my daily life was so horrible that I need to stop it altogether or be rejected completely by someone whom I care very much about. My boyfriend stopped short of agreeing with her, but admitted that he sees what she is talking about. He said he told me all of this because ""it was either me or her"" (telling me).  I'm afraid this sounds silly but ""telling stories"" is how I communicate, how I relate to others, share myself and my life. 

I do know that sometimes I talk too much and I can be too loud. I wear hearing aids now and that has helped my volume. I am an enthusiastic, outgoing person and I do know it can come across as too much sometimes. But this just really came out of nowhere with her and I am, to be honest, crushed. 

I am supposed to be going over there for dinner tomorrow night but I REALLY am not up for it. I know I'll just cry and be miserable all evening. My heart is so hurt. AITA for backing out on dinner?"
"AITA for ""causing"" our family vacation to end? | Background: My parents decided to take my sister and me on vacation for the long weekend. We settled into a smallish hotel and the morning after, we decided to go on a hike. My father told us to wear our hiking boots and I complied while my sister threw a tantrum, begrudgingly wearing them after ten or so minutes. By this time, both my parents were somewhat frustrated so we set off.

About a quarter of a mile in, I asked if I could play music through my earbuds while walking the remaining two miles and this was met with, in my opinion, an overly forceful NO even though none of us were talking to one another. A few minutes later, I asked again, explaining that it wouldn't hurt them and I would enjoy the walk a lot more, and this time my mother begins to scream about how my phone is ""destroying the family."" She keeps shouting (*incredibly* loudly) and I see a lot of people (maybe 3 or 4 passing families, almost 20 people) stop and turn their heads in our direction.

By now I didn't know what to do and I felt super embarrassed and humiliated in front of these people. In frustration, I walk back to the parking lot. After my parents return, my phone connection is immediately terminated (I'm posting on computer) and my mother goes on a solid 2-hour rant about how my actions were completely unjustified, how she was fully in the right, and ordered us to get into the car so we could drive back home. I think it was a lot of pent-up anger about my sister being defiant earlier, desire for what she sees as family time (despite hardly talking during the hike), and towards my use of the phone recently to listen to music, text my friends, and play games maybe eight hours a week total.

My action of storming back was also caused my some previously stored resentment, where my mother had made some recent and extremely disparaging comparisons to my friends' academic grades and mocked my ""lack of a social life.""

So Reddit, AITA? I *never* consciously knew nor wanted our three-day vacation to be cut short like this but my parents still insist that I'm responsible for it.

&#x200B;

Edit: for the Redditors saying INFO: The only other time I had used my phone during the vacation was also to listen to music for part of the drive there. In general, my mother dislikes it when I'm on the phone but in this case I genuinely thought it was a harmless question.

Edit 2: for those saying that I could have started the conversation, my mother had no intention of talking. She wanted me to ""hear the sounds of nature"" which I find ridiculous and in fact told me to be quiet two or three times when I said anything."
"Aita for expecting an employee to know what's one their menu? | I go to DD in the mornings and I notice they have a new burrito bowl. The options are veggie and chorizo. So I get in and I order a chorizo burrito bowl. The woman asks me which kind I wanted. I am confused because I literally just said what kind. So I repeat that I want the chorizo. She tells me yes, but there are 2 kinds, sausage and veggie. I nod and say yes, I want the chorizo. She gets frustrated and passes me off to another employee.

I again ask for chorizo. This one actually understands and tells the other that it is the sausage that I want. She says well I asked her and she kept saying chorizo. I says yes because that's what's on the menu. The lady taking my orders says, yes, but it's just sausage. They just call it that because it's spicy. 

Anyways, I end walking out because they moved in to another person before I even got finish my order. As I walked out they were loudly complaining that I'm a bad person for arguing. After the fact I realized I could have just said that I wanted the sausage, but honestly they should have known what I was talking about. Aita?

Edit: the second one knew what I was talking about. She immediately picked up that I was talking about sausage. The first one had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. When I said burrito bowl with chorizo, she asked me what flavor I wanted. The only 2 options on the menu was Chorizo and Veggie. I acknowledge that I was definitely a jerk, but I still feel like she should have known that the chorizo was the sausage. I'm not annoyed because she called it sausage. I'm annoyed because she literally didn't know that I was talking about the sausage when I said chorizo."
"AITA for giving alcohol to homeless people? | Short story short I hosted a big NYE party which was BYOB. 

Lots of alcohol was left over and since I'm not a big drinker, I set apart a couple nice liquors that I like and dropped the rest in my trunk (about 15 bottles of booze). 
Then today when I was driving around town a homeless man came to my window to beg for change, I didn't have any so I gave him a bottle of booze. The man was ecstatic, as this is a 20$ bottle of Scotch. We exchanged  new year's wishes and we were both on our way .

Then I thought it would be a nice gesture to give away that alcohol which I wouldn't drink anyway to people who are out in the cold and would cherish having a drink since most cannot afford it. I drove around downtown for an hour seeking out homeless people, giving them bottles of alcohol and wishing them happy new year.

When I shared the story with my friends and SO most of them reprimanded me telling me that many people who have ended up in the streets might be recovering addicts or alcoholics and that by giving them drinks I was actually not helping them. Although I considered this approach I find it to be patronising and presumptuous. 

You cannot know what somebody has been through and what they do or do not need in their lives. All the people I approached were truly happy and thankful and frankly, if I was in their place I would have loved for someone to give me some whiskey on new year's day."
"AITA for topping up my boyfriend’s budget for my engagement ring? | My BF (27M) and I (26F) have been together for 3 years and we have plans to get engaged this winter. I’m in charge of picking and buying the ring since we agree I have better taste and I’ll be wearing it. BF told me he is comfortable with contributing 14k, which I’m fine with, and after discussing it with my mom, my mom and I decided that we would top up another 11k (to be split equally between my mom and I). BF gave this the green light. 

This week, my mom and I went ring shopping and we discussed the options at home. My dad overheard our conversation and asked in an annoyed tone: “If his budget is 14k, why the hell are you guys topping it up and getting sth fancier?” I explained that it’s a win-win - he doesn’t pay more than what he’s comfortable with and I share the burden to afford sth I truly like. My mom’s share is, well, a wedding gift, which is very kind of her. 

My dad wasn’t satisfied and grudgingly asked: “Why does he have to ‘buy’ you?” Patiently my mom and I explained it’s quite common practice now, that my BF’s older brother and sister both have engagement rings (bought entirely by the guys). Dad concluded the conversation with: “Does he feel insulted by what you’re doing?”, and it was very clear that it was an accusation, not a question. 

While my BF and I are both young, we’re both successful professionals and both have large amounts of savings. My BF’s share (14k) will put a small dent in his, and I feel that by offering to top up, I’m not implying “urgh, you’re too poor” but rather “it’s only fair that I also pay for part of my ring.” My mom agrees, but my dad thinks I’m spoiled and ungrateful. 

So, AITA?

Edit: I was hoping for fresh and insightful perspectives on the scenario I’ve laid out here, instead, I just got a lot of “HOW DARE YOU HAVE MONEY?!”, the charity chorus, and gatekeeping on how we should spend our money. That’s just sad, Reddit. People shouldn’t have to apologise for having successful careers and spending power. That’s my final word."
"AITA for giving both of my kids the same money for Back to School Shopping? | We've got twins, Sara and Syed.  They're 14 and entering High School this year.  For clothes shopping, I decided I'd just give them some money and let them buy whatever they want with minimal oversight.  I told them both I'd give them $300 now, and another $300 for Winter.  My idea is they're old enough to budget and make these kinds of decisions for themselves.  They can spend the money online, or at the mall, whatever they want.  

&#x200B;

So they both said they wanted to go to the mall and I went with them.  I wanted to just let them loose, but my 2 14 year olds walking around with $600 didn't sit well with me.  We had a few conversations about the most efficient way to do this.  Figure out what you NEED, and what you WANT.  Find out the stores you want to shop at, get an idea about their prices, then when we get to the mall do a walkthru at all of these stores and find out what kind of deals they have and what items you want.  Then go back, try shit on, and buy what you like.  

&#x200B;

Syed took my advice well.  He went into a few stores, and found the ones that had the best deals that he wanted.  He bought 3 pairs of pants for $100, 5 shirts for $100, then a pair of Vans on clearance for $30.  He had money left over so he bought a video game.  

&#x200B;

Sara kinda just casually shopped through the stores and bought what she liked.  All of the prices were reasonable so I didn't say much.  She actually ended up with about 2x the amount of clothes (plus accessories) Syed did.  But Sara started complaining that it wasn't enough money to get everything she needed.  I told her then she can return some stuff and buy what she needed somewhere else?  She said no, what she already bought is stuff she needs so that wouldn't help.  I said oh well, thems the brakes.  You gotta budget better and prioritize.  She'll get more money in a couple of months.  She was unhappy.

&#x200B;

When we got home Sara cried to my Wife   She complained that its unfair her and Syed get the same amount because girls have more needs when it comes to clothes than boys.  She points out that she had to spend $50 just on underwear, while Syed paid $0.  I actually demanded they both spend $30 to buy socks and underwear that I paid for personally, separate from the $300.  Why does a 14 year old girl need to spend $80 on underwear?  Obviously she already has underwear, and I'm giving her more money in a few months.  I would just buy her more underwear if she really needed it anyway.  

&#x200B;

Both Wife and Sara insist that Syed can just pretty much wear the same shit every day and no one would care.  But as a girl, she needs at least 2 weeks worth of unique outfits plus matching accessories.  Its not about spending the same amount on both kids, its about spending enough to put them on the same social level.  I'm not sure if thats true."
"AITA for telling my girlfriend that she needs a better job to support our family? | Two years ago, my girlfriend (38) and I (32) asked my father if we can stay in his house until we pay off our student loans and have enough to move to our own place. Being the kind man that he is, he agreed to it. I was unemployed at the time but I took temp jobs and eventually a temp job turned into full time. My girlfriend works as a cashier at a retailer, so she doesn’t make enough money to save. So our combined income is really just my income, which ain’t much but I can save considering that we don’t pay rent.

For years I’ve been trying to ask her if she can get a better job or an additional job that will supplement our income but she will come up with excuses like “More hours will make me tired,” or “I already applied for jobs this week.” She’s interested in fashion but says that classes that teach it are too expensive. I found her a free class online but she’d say “I’d rather do it in person” and we end up an impasse. I even looked and found cheaper classes but she says “it doesn’t look like a quality class” and we’ll yet again go nowhere. I suggested that maybe she teach herself, so I bought her books and equipment to make clothes and she’ll say that “I’m not in the right headspace to use it at the moment.” The unopened equipment is currently being used as her table.

Back to the present. My girlfriend, now pregnant, and my father get into an argument over kitchen space, my dad angrily said “get out of my house.” Now she wants to leave as soon as possible. I tell her that even if we move, we won’t have enough to support the kid or even buy food for it but nonetheless we looked for apartments. After numerous tours, it became clear that it was impossible for us to pay rent solely on my income. I had an asthma attack when I saw the initial costs and as I told her that we couldn’t afford it as well as me having an asthma attack, she refused to talk to me. She says that if we can’t get a place then she’ll just move in with her brother, who lives out of state in a 2 bedroom apartment that currently has 6 people already staying there. I say that’s crazy and just reconcile with my father but she refuses. I tell her that if she looked for a better job, even now, it’ll help us move but she says “nobody is going to hire a pregnant woman.”

So now we’re not talking and she’s moving to her brother’s. For months I've been taking LinkedIn classes in my field so that I can move up, doing filmmaking on the side (in hopes that it can pay the bills one day) and my loans are nearly paid off. I’m extremely overwhelmed yet I feel like I’m the bad guy. I’m doing the best that I can to give this kid a bright future but I don’t know if she has the same values. AITA?"
"AITA for leaving my boyfriend(30) behind and going, with my friends, on a trip that was meant for him n I? | You see, for Easter (2019) my bf and I (F27) planned to visit another country. Before I planned the trip and booked accommodation (a month ago) I asked him if his passport was fine for travel, he said yes.
Now this is the prob, today he checked his passport - after having left it dormant for 3 yrs - and discovered that it expired last year (2018). I accept things quickly, so I'm not tripping about it, instead what's on my mind is who I can go with. I've just asked my buddies to join me, they know the history and theyre still keen.
I feel sorry for my bf tho, we were both looking forward to this trip but he's reluctantly accepted that I still wanna go. If I should change my mind, the last day to cancel is tomorrow.
AITA for going without him??? It's not my fault he has to remain behind.

Edit: I canceled the trip, we can do/go something/somewhere else.

Edit B: Please note that I live in South Africa, not America. While I welcome your comments, kindly note that the procedures around Passport renewal are different here. Thanks for your insight tho 🙂"
"AITA For Being ""Cheap"" Towards My GF Even Though I'm Wealthy? | I'm M23 and do to a huge stroke of luck 2 years ago, I won a lot of money. I'm talking about life changing for my family and I. After the dust settled I set up my parents, and sister so they never had to work again and helped some friends. I didn't go crazy just bought a benz and a very nice condo and house. 

I don't work and just finished school, but the money got me a lot of extra attention from women. I started dating a girl last year, and she's out of my league and I wouldn't have got her without the money. But I barely spend anything on her, I cover dinners, her mani/pedi, other dates and that is it. She did ask me for a small allowance which I refused but I did give her 1.5k as a birthday gift to pay for a college course. She never asks for anything and is always greatful to whatever I give her. 

She recently brought up giving her a loan so she can start a small business doing hair,nails, salon stuff I'm guessing. She's 22, and has no exp in running a business but said I can run the business side and we can make it a personal loan and get it written up. I think these are shitty businesses but she wants me to invest because I have been injecting some capital into startups that are at a seed stage in funding. 

I basically told her that salons are shit businesses and I don't want a part in it, if she figures out a better idea and presents me with a business plan. I'll give her a loan and take a piece of the business to help her run it. She called me a huge asshole and how she has never asked me for anything in the year we've been together and will pay back the loan no matter what and that I'm a cheap douchebag. 

AITA?"
"AITA for using vegan cheese? | I got home from work tonight late, so my parents and little sister (20) had already eaten and there weren’t any leftovers as far as I could tell. I was starving so decided to make myself a couple grilled cheeses. There was a bowl of shredded cheddar in the fridge so I grabbed that and used most of it to make 2 sandwiches. The cheese tasted a little different but still pretty good. I just figured my parents had bought old style cheddar or something instead of mild. 

The next morning when I got up my mom asked me if I had used the cheese in a bowl in the fridge. I said yes. She then informed me that was my sisters, and she was not happy. My sister isnt quite vegan but she’s vegetarian and lactose intolerant. I said to tell her I didn’t know but apparently my sister had gone on a rant about she forgets to label one fucking thing she didn’t think would get eaten overnight and it’s gone, but there was still a little bit left and my mom was gonna go out to buy her more before she needed it that night so I feel like my sister was making a bigger deal of it than necessary. 

AITA for not “magically knowing” the cheese was vegan? Honestly I think my sister should be happy I barely even noticed the difference since it proved that vegan cheese isn’t all that bad after all. She’s getting more."
"AITA For Calling Out A Rich Friend's Fake Fundraiser | For the content of this circumstance I will refer to the couple as Amy & Adam.

I want to set the scene for how financially stable Amy and Adam are... not because of envy... but it comes into play in a very big way. 

They are the dictionary definition of white privilege. (For context I do not work either and I'm a stay at home mom so I know what that privilege is myself...) 

Amy doesn't work & Adam has a very fun six figure job. 
They want for  nothing and greatly enjoy their success and life.

Amy cannot have children & and is a self proclaimed baby crazy lady. They already have one adopted child (who was 3 by this time) and instantly Amy decide they need another one as soon as possible. 

Amy & Adam join a private adoption agency for the 2nd adoption. This was to cut the red tape of adopting from the state. As with all adoptions you are told to be prepared, the birth mother could change her mind.

Sadly, for Amy and Adam, after the baby was born the birth mother did changed her mind and decided to keep her baby.

Per the private adoption agency's contract all the funds they spent for the failed adoption would be placed into an escrow account and applied to the next adoption of a baby that became available through the agency. They would be placed back on the wait list.

However, this wasn't acceptable for Amy. She was going to have to wait again, and Amy doesn't like to wait... Amy starts sending out messages to friends, family, and on social media because she is desperate for another baby. If anyone knew of someone thinking of placing their soon to be born child up for adoption... please ... let them know. 

Next, Amy has Adam hire a nanny so she can go take a 10 week retreat in SoCal to deal with the disappointment of the adoption falling through. 

But to Amy's delight, shortly after returning from sunny SoCal.. a young teen (just like the movie Juno) in the area is willing to let Amy adopt her baby.... however this girl is not through their private adoption agency.... therefore they will NOT be able to access the money in the private agency's escrow account. Amy and Adam will have to cover all the adoption costs themselves. 

Now, the grotesquely out of touch Amy decides to convince her husband they should create a fundraiser.
It is not enough for Amy to just post the link to her new fundraiser to her socail media page. Oh no, she private messages every single person (almost 2000) on her friends list the link. Even more ridiculous she placed the amount they were trying to raise at almost $20,000. (In truth the adoption would've been closer to $10,000).

Pleaee take into account many on Amy's friend list have experienced layoffs in the last 3 years and NONE of them are as financially as well off as Amy & Adam.

The fact Amy is oblivious enough about her friends lives and their financial troubles makes the audacity to private message those people to bankroll their adoption leave a very irked feeling behind... I basically hit a level of rage didn't know existed. 

I sent Amy a DM. (About a day or 2 after)

I suggested if she needed money to pay for the adoption perhaps she might consider selling her BMW, and look at driving a more cost effective one. Or, they could sell their 3 car garage, bonus room, private theater, 5 bedroom home and get something a little more reasonable if they couldn't afford $18,000ish to adopt another. I was trying to have her see how ridiculously crazy when you live their lifestyle to make a fundraiser! Basically, their fundraiser was like going to a food bank for groceries when their bank account was full.

Amy was livid. She said the fundraiser was due to so many of their friends desperate to help after the other adoption fell through. (We meant dinners, helping to raise their spirits not by writing checks). Also.. Amy belongs to one of the mega churches that preaches God rewards you with prosperity and it was this church's friends who were fanning the flames of the fundraiser.

 Amy admitted when I DM'd her about the fundraiser that they were NOT in actual need of money. (And we all knew that because they put in an offer on a new home less than a week before she made the fundraiser).

She was livid because she couldn't believe I would suggest instead hitting up their friends for money they don't really need instead curbing their spending on luxury items. 
Why would you do a fundraiser when you put in an offer on a new home?

I'm all for adoption and I was adopted myself but you don't get to use an adoption to fund an over the top lifestyle. Fundraisers are for people truly in need are they not?

 Her fundraiser closed with less than a thousand donated. 

So. Am I The Asshole?"
"AITA for sharing straws without disclosing that I have the herpes virus? | I've had cold sores (tested as HSV-1) since I was a kid but haven't had outbreaks for years. Even when I don't have an active cold sore, I try to be careful about not sharing utensils/drinks/straws with other people - except with one group of friends I have. 

I've been friends with this group for many years. Back when I first knew them, one friend accidentally drank out of my water bottle when we went camping. I tried to stop her but didn't make it in time. Since then, I've shared many drinks over the years with her and other people in this friend group, and I've never told anyone that I had the herpes virus. In the beginning, it was because I didn't want the friend who drank from my bottle to get mad at me for not telling her (since we were still new friends back then). Later on, I felt like I missed the boat on telling them (if we've shared so many drinks already over the years, what's the point of telling them now?)

Since we've always been pretty casual about sharing drinks and straws, eventually I thought that they didn't care all that much. Cold sores are pretty common, so maybe they have it already. But recently, I found out that at least one friend does care, and she cares a lot. We were talking one day and somehow the topic of herpes was raised up. One friend started talking about how cold sores are herpes too, and how she's really careful about sharing cups and straws with people, but ""you guys are okay because I trust that you don't have it"" (mind you, the girl who said this is not the same girl who drank out of my water bottle back in the day). Other people agreed with her. I felt like I was gonna die from guilt, but didn't have the courage to admit I had it. Some of my friends will probably get really mad that I never told them after all these years, and I don't want to risk losing these friends.

AITA for not telling them that I've had cold sores in the past?"
"AITA for asking my gf to keep my criminal process secret from her parents? | I'm in a bit of trouble because I was drunk driving a Lime scooter. My friend and me had to get back home and the last train home was going in under 15mins. In my country e-scooters are being treated the same as cars, so after the police stopped me and I had to do a sobriety test, they took me to the police station and now I stand accused of drunk driving. I don't have a license yet and this is the first time I came into conflict with the law, so I think it's not a big deal).

My friends know about it, my parents, my girlfriend, my girlfriend's friends. But I don't want her parents to know, especially since her mom is super judgy and already thinks poorly of me whenever I'm not acting like the perfect ""son-in-law"" she wishes me to be.

My gf still wants to tell them. Today, she said she will tell it to them sooner or later, whether I like it or not. I understand that she has a close relationship to her mom, and that she feels the need to share every secret with her. But I feel mistreated because I don't have control over who gets to know about my very own flaws (it will likely be spread to her whole family).

In the end it wouldn't be a big deal but this leads to a more general question: Shouldn't she, as my significant other, be able to keep secrets, even from her parents if I don't feel good about them knowing? I personally would be totally fine with keeping her ""secrets"" from my parents but I have a totally different relation to my parents."
"Aita for not talking to my boyfriend if he doesnt stick to my schedule | So to cope with everything and make sure I'm being productive I have started making schedules, for example itll be like 8am wake up, do work from 9 am to 12pm, call boyfriend 12pm to 3PM, hang out with my mother 3pm to 5pm etc.
I generally make them in the evening the day before and check with everyone who is on it if my schedule is okay for them for example if I want to call my friend at 12 I'll ask her does that work for her or does she want me to shuffle things around.
I do the same with my boyfriend, and I know everything has been hard on him so I try to make sure we get at least 4-5 hours of call a day (I go to bed at nine and normally walk up at nine so in a twelve hour day he generally gets about 40% of the day). I will send him the schedule the day before and ask him if its okay for him, however he has a problem with going to bed late and waking up late thus missing his schedule time, he then asks if I can stay on the phone with him an hour later and if I say no he gets in a grump and gets slightly annoyed with me. I understand why he gets annoyed with me not wanting to change my schedule but this is something that me and my therapist have talked about to help me control my stress. He also sometimes gets annoyed if we have less than 3 hours call time a day and I just dont know what to do coz then I feel bad coz I know he doesnt talk to his family or his friends that much so I'm kinda the only person he talks to during all this so I know it's not fun for him if I'm busy. So am I the asshole for not rearranging my schedule for him?"
"AITA for telling my girlfriend she cannot get a dog? | My girlfriend and I have lived together for 3 years. We have 2 cats, which we both love and we made joint decision to get them. For a while she has talked about getting a dog, but I have always said no. I have never liked dogs and never will and she knew this very early on in the relationship. I don't like how agressive they are and how they will jump on to you, bark at you and just generally be annoying and a nuisance. She asked about getting one again yesterday, and I told her no and that I will never allow her to get one as long as we live together. She got angry at me and said I can't forbid her from getting one if she wants. I agreed and told her that if she does get one then I will simply move out and break up with her.  She started crying and calling me an asshole and is still angry and barely talking to me.

AITA for not letting her get a dog while living with me?"
"AITA for getting my mother a flask that says “f*ck you” on it for Christmas? | Am I the Asshole for getting my mentally abusive mother a flask that says f*ck you on it for Christmas??

 My mother never wanted kids, and she should have never had kids. She would constantly tell me that children ruin lives. She would always take me places so she could drink and party with friends. She would leave me at home during the summer with only cans of beans in the pantry and wouldn’t let me go to my dads house. She would call me fat, but wouldn’t buy me nutritional snacks because it “ wasn’t in the budget” and then go out to concerts, get wasted, and get tattoos. She would constantly say stuff like “ oh your cute clothes obviously aren’t comfortable”. When I told her I was depressed and felt like my life wasn’t worth living anymore, she told me to suck it up. She said I was faking it for attention. She would constantly complain about having to take care of me like it was a chore. Keep in mind I’m a 17 year old who doesn’t need someone hovering over them every minute of the day. 

With my mental health destroying my life, I decided to move out and live with my Dad full time. She was obviously hurt, but I couldn’t take it anymore. Living with her made me feel like absolute garbage. I tried to see her once a week and be civil, she would always try to guilt me into moving back in by making herself the victim.  On Thanksgiving, she accused me of not loving her in front of our whole entire family and then said “ I have all of your shit in boxes, what do you want me to do, throw it away?” in a snarky tone. At this point, I have completely given up on being civil with my mother. I have tried and tried to just have a normal, functioning relationship with her. I wasn’t going to get her anything for Christmas, but I saw a flask that said “ f*ck you” on it, and decided that’s what I was gonna get her.  I admit that I did stoop down to her level, but am I the asshole??"
"AITA for laughing when my daughter gets hurt? | My daughter is 5 yrs old. She’s the typical 5 yr old who is regularly getting bumps and bruises, walking into things, tripping over things, accidentally hitting herself with things, etc. My perspective (the father) of seeing her get hurt in this manner is two-pronged: First, I’ve always been the type who laughs when I hurt myself in certain ways, it’s like when you hit your funny bone but I have funny bones all over my body. It’s just my instinct to laugh when I get hit by something even though it does really hurt. Secondly, it’s my instinct as a parent to want my daughter to be tough and shake it off, and I’m of the belief that children often look at other people’s reaction to the incident to decide how they’re going to react. So if my daughter, say, walks into a door knob and I’m there to see it I will start laughing first because I’m thinking of how it would make me feel and second because I’m hoping even though it hurt her that she’ll see me laughing and be able to laugh it off with me. It should be known that I am physically taking care of her at the same time. Even as I’m laughing I’m assessing if she is bleeding or has a more severe injury, I’ll ask if she wants an ice pack or rub the spot she hurt, etc. I’m an observant person and confident I would recognize the difference between bumps and bruises and a more serious injury. 99.99% of the time the result ends with her being fine within a couple minutes. My wife hasn’t outright argued with me about this but she has questioned why I laugh and whether it’s appropriate. I explain myself just like I am now and there’s never really more to it than that. But am I an asshole for laughing in any way? Again, I’ve seen no ill physical or psychological effects on my daughter and my wife doesn’t claim there are. But is there anything I’m not thinking through clearly that makes me an asshole for laughing at her pain?

Edit: Clarifications: I’m not just laughing at her, I’m talking her through what happened and how to feel better while laughing and encouraging her to laugh by describing it as a goofy thing to have happened. There are times where she’s actually started laughing with me. Also, I’m not talking about laughing at physical or mental problems like disabilities. I’m talking about when you have pain, whether physical or mental, I’m trying to raise my daughter to be able to find humor for herself to help get through those painful moments. A way of being able to see a positive in a negative.

Current conclusion: I still believe it’s ok to try to illicit humor out of the situation as a method of handling it, but I do understand one risk is that my daughter is still young enough to think it’s ok to laugh at others when they get hurt and I’ll have to work on teaching her when it’s appropriate to find humor in something and when it’s not."
"AITA for looking up my gf's best friends tits? | So my gf has a best friend that we will call Beth. Beth seems to be a nudist of some sort. We she comes over to swim at our place she will ALWAYS skinny dip. When she spends the night her morning ritual is to take a shower then come out to the living room have a bowl of cereal butt ass naked before going back to her room to get dressed. So I have seen her naked more times than I can count and my gf has never once said anything about it.

So last week we went on vacation and my gf asked Beth to dogsit for us while we were gone and she agreed. So before we left I wrote a note detailing the ins and outs that she would need to be made aware of. The final note of the list was me letting her know that we put up security cams in the house. I did that with a little bit of humor by saying, ""Friendly reminder: We installed security cameras so if you do the horizontal tango while we are gone, we will know and we will watch... repeatedly.""

My girlfriend saw the note before leaving and didn't object to it at all. She just laughed and called me an idiot. So the first night my girlfriend tells me, ""Looks like she found your note, she jiggled her tits in front of the camera."" So I laugh and open my phone to take a look. My girlfriend gets mad at this asked if I really had the audacity to open my phone right then and there to look at her friends tits. I said, ""yeah, it was apart of the joke that I left her. It isn't like I haven't seen them a thousand times before.""

She called me a pig a walked off. So am I the asshole for breaking some obvious rule I was unaware of?"
"AITA for making my husband take down his wall mounted guns? | My husband is a veteran, who enjoys everything that has to do with guns. During the week he goes to the range with his friends around 1-3 times. On the weekends he’ll usually be hunting or participating in his rifle association. He also suffers from PTSD, insomnia, and depression so I try to let him do the things he enjoys to help him with his hardships.

Fast forward to the present, I have never hosted a event for my family as I have always been super busy with work. My nephew, who I love very dearly was about to turn 2, so I decided to offer to host the party for my sister since I know her house is extremely messy since she has to take care of a infant.

Once I started cleaning I realized how unsuitable our home might appear to guests, we have many flags, medals, and guns mounted everywhere around the house. I decided that the biggest thing that needed to be addressed were the weapons, so I asked if we could temporarily take them down.

He agreed to take them all down except for one, which is located right above our fireplace. His reason being that his very close friend died literally by his side in battle, and something he had always promised was to keep and honor all of his memorabilia, as he doesn’t have a wife or children. 

He believes removing his weapon from the mantle would be a dishonor to his friend, and thinks that he is already being accommodating enough by removing the rest of the weapons. 

I’m not that satisfied on one hand I do empathize for my husband, on the other I don’t want parents to be uncomfortable with a weapon in their view, especially with kids around.

Any advice is appreciated, if you have any questions feel free to ask. I’m getting ready for work currently so I might not be able to reply quickly but I will definitely get around to it.

Am I the asshole here?

Edit: Wow, just got home from work. I’m blown away that this got so much attention. I appreciate everyone’s replies, I’m gonna try to be as thorough as possible. 

INFO

Firstly, I think my husband is very brave and I’m extremely proud of his service/what he loves to do. I didn’t mean I was ashamed of his memorabilia, I simply was concerned if it would be a little much for a children’s party. I didn’t want any of the medals or awards taken down, just the weapons.

Question and Answer
(I will keep updating as I read, I just got home so I’ll be getting ready for bed/replying as much as I can!)

Q: Is the gun loaded?
A: No, it isn’t. My husband said it isn’t capable of being fired in its current state.

Q: Did I ask him about the party before I had it?
A: Yes, he agreed to it but didn’t know we would be taking down the weapons until after I discussed it with him. I hadn’t been thinking about it prior either, it came into my mind when I was cleaning.

"AITA if I don't want to babysit my ""first time skier"" friend on an expensive trip to Vermont? | So every year my friends and I plan a destination ski trip. Most of us are experienced skiers / snowboarders and can ride the entire mountain. All of us only get to go a few times a year so we like to go pretty hard. I didn't invite my one friend (call her Lucy) because she has never skied before in her life.  Lucy over hears our conversation about the ski trip and strongly insists on attending. She says that she is a fast learner and will take a lesson.

&#x200B;

Lessons are only 2 hours long so I expressed my concerns about having to babysit her the rest of the day. I'm paying good money on this trip! Why should I have to follow Lucy around on the bunny slopes? I also offered to teach her on the local mountain some other time that would be conducive to here skill level but she got upset and cried.

&#x200B;

Also important to note that all of us are probably skiing two days but i think Lucy is only skiing one day. Not confirmed yet.

&#x200B;

Anyways, am I the asshole for not wanting Lucy to attend?

&#x200B;

Edit: wording

UPDATE:  Thanks for all of the replies everyone! All in all, my intention was not be the asshole but I feel like it could go either way depending on how I handle the situation here after. Im glad Lucy wants to learn how to ski / be part of the group and this post made me see that. Maybe she’s not even asking me to keep be the helicopter friend that I’m trying to be. 

I’m a strong lurker on Reddit and I don’t post much. I’ve never posted in this sub before and I see why people do. It gets you to understand different points of view from a diverse group of people. 

Thanks again all :)"
"AITA for wanting to fart and burp in front of my SO at home? | So I was discussing with my SO earlier today about how she finds me farting and burping disgusting. In my opinion it should be totally normal to do this at home, this goes for her as well. But she on the other hand means that this belongs in the bathroom and one should always go to the bathroom to do so. And if you want to burp you should at least try to hide it. For me this sounds like treating each other like strangers. But idk maybe i'm being an asshole.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

Ok, so i've noticed a lot of different opinions of course. I don't know what I thought this would be kind of unanimous. Anyhow I think the best action here is to kind of cool it down a bit? I will continue to burp, cause drinking cola and not burp is hell. But maybe be more considerate of the other end of the body! Some people here pulls this too far, if you think my relationship is gonna fail because of this then you can't be that secure of your own. Take care and thanks for the judgement!"
"AITA for not changing my prom dress? | I graduated high school this year. For senior prom, all the girls had a Facebook page where we could all show off our dresses prior the date and make sure no one had the same one. I struggle finding dresses that fit me well and anything I really like. When I went shopping, I finally found a really nice, white dress. I put it on the page while shopping and a bunch of people said “This is the same dress as Kelly\*” (not her real name). I am not friends with Kelly, but we’re also not enemies or anything. I saw her dress and it was the same dress, but a different color (hers was pink). I messaged her on FB and she asked that I not get my dress, because she spent so long looking for hers and she wanted to feel unique. We went to a small school so the odds of anyone else having the dress were going to be low. So, at first, I said okay. But the more I looked, the more I really couldn’t find a dress that I really loved. I kept thinking of that dress. So, I ended up buying it but not saying anything. I just told some very close friends that I was getting the dress in question.

Come prom night, I show up. Kelly doesn’t seem me at first, but one of her friends does and screams “Kelly!!!” She turns around, sees me and makes this angry face, but doesn’t say anything to me for the rest of the night. A lot of people said they were proud of me for not listening to Kelly, because she shouldn’t get to dictate what I wore. Especially as we weren’t friends or anything and it really didn’t matter. I had a really fun time at prom and there was no drama.

However, even after graduation, Kelly is still pissed about it. I ran into her recently and she was ice cold. Like I said, we were never friends, but we were at least cordial prior to this. However, she acts like it’s an ultimate betrayal. My friend, who is friends with one of her friends says, that Kelly feels I ruined her prom.

AITA for not changing my dress?"
"AITA for abandoning someone on a night out? | I organise nights out for a bunch of friends through MeetUp which means it's open to strangers. People tend to turn up and introduce themselves if they're new. We sit around at a bar, drink and chat with each other. This new guy turns up that I've never seen before though some people have seen him before. After about 30 minutes he starts doing bumps of some drugs quite openly, offering it to people and then doing more himself.

In a short amount time he's completely gone, stumbling all over the place and knocking glasses over. Someone complains and he gets thrown out. I follow to make sure he's alright but he's completely out of it. I spend about 30 minutes trying to get him to unlock his phone or tell me where he lives but he's not coherent. I give up and head back inside to enjoy the rest of the night.

3 hours later the place is shutting and we're all leaving, he's still there on the streets still completely out of it. Some people try to help him but he's not answering. People ask me if I'm going to do anything as I'm the host but I just ignore him and head home. He most probably spent the night on the street like that."
"WIBTA if I take my special needs son to the movies? | My son has a vocal tick. 

Basically every 15-30 minutes he yelps. There’s no warning, no trigger or precipitating event, and there’s no way to stifle it. 

This hasn’t impacted a whole lot in his life because in school we just go in and let the teachers know and in play kids yell all the time. 

Certain situations that would unnecessarily inconvenience others, or worse, open him up to embarrassment, we just avoid. Going to the movies has always been on of those things. 

He’s 10 now and he wants to go. 

My husband says no way should we take him because if he had paid $12 to see a movie and someone screamed every ten minutes, he’d be irate and we shouldn’t ruin the experience for others. 

I agree with him that we have no right to ruin the experience for others, but if I took him to like an afternoon showing of a kids movie would I be an asshole? 

He’s been asking to go to the movies for weeks now and I think it’s a minor enough annoyance for people to look past."
"AITA for giving family a test before I let them babysit? | My husband and I recently had a baby girl, and everyone in both our families keeps asking to babysit. I decided on a simple ""test"" to see who's ready, where I ask family to watch her for a bit while I go do something in another room, like fold laundry or take a quick shower. Sometimes it goes bad, like my grandma turned off her hearing aid so she wouldn't be bothered by the baby crying. But other times it goes fine, and we've got a trusted new sitter.

My BIL and SIL came to visit and wanted to babysit, so we tried the test. They didn't even have the baby for 2 minutes before coming to fetch me for help. I figured that meant they failed for now and just aren't ready to babysit a newborn yet, but we can try again when baby is older.

My BIL ended up heading home early, alone, saying he needed to work. Like a month later my SIL asked my husband why we didn't let them babysit. He told her about the test, and she got mad. SIL then said that we actually failed THEIR test, and that they had counted how many questions we asked them about themselves during the visit, and the answer was zero, so that was why BIL left.

I was thrown- I was sure I'd asked them about their flight, their jobs, a wedding they'd attended that we missed because of the baby- all the usual polite small talk. But we're exhausted, so it's totally possible I didn't. But even so...maybe cut the tired new parents some slack?

TLDR: AITA for not trusting family with the new baby, or should they cut a new mom some slack?

EDIT: Some suggested edits from the comments, BIL and SIL had never changed a diaper before and didn't seem interested in learning.
And we're not asking anyone to babysit for us! It's family that keeps insisting we go out and give them alone time with the baby.

EDIT: thanks for the verdict, I'll send them an apology."
"WIBTA If I didn’t tell the school about their broken lunch website | My husband and I pay about $120 a month for school lunches for two of our kids. Our district uses a website for the parents to load money onto their lunch accounts, and in March I loaded enough to get them through to Spring Break (third week of April). 

Their first day back to school I panicked because I hadn’t loaded any money on their lunch accounts because I didn’t get a low balance reminder email. I assumed it got sent to spam so I logged in to add more and they already had a good amount left in there. I chalked it up to me miscalculating and set a reminder for myself to log in at the end of the week to add more money. 

The end of the week came and the same amount was in each account. I checked the cafeteria purchases and they were buying lunch, but for some reason not being charged. The website still says “we’ll be down for maintenance April 9th and April 10th” and that looks like the last time they were charged, so I’m guessing something happened with the site that caused this error. I’ve been monitoring it to see if it kicks back in, but it still hasn’t. 

My husband says we should just be grateful we have one less expense right now and reminded me our school taxes are ridiculous (highest in the county, 9th highest in the state) so we should think of it as a rebate. But I grew up in a very religious family (although I’m not religious myself anymore) so the thought of not telling them about this issue makes me feel incredibly guilty. 

WIBTA if I kept silent?

Edit: One redditor brought up how their school had free lunches and she stopped being charged. I do remember getting a paper about free lunches and breakfast but I assumed it was for summer. I’m wondering now if they started it early and I just didn’t pay attention. It was really early for that type of notice. Also outside purchases are being deducted, my kindergartener bought an ice cream yesterday and he was charged 50 cents, but the lunch amount shows “$0.00” as the price.  I did just send an email through the lunch website to ask if this is a site error or if i should speak to the district. Thanks for all your input!"
"AITA for not wanting my (20F) boyfriend (18M) involved with the pregnancy? | We've been together for a year now.

We recently found out I was pregnant, I do not want it but he does, we compromised and decided I'd carry to term and give it up for adoption and we will be able to continue on with our relationship.

He wants to continue with the relationship and obviously bonding with the baby would be a problem, if he wanted to break up I would consider letting him bond to it more 

Problem is my boyfriend wants to be involved with the pregnancy, go to appointments and just wants to be with me every single moment of the day, I know he will bond with the  baby so I've told him he isn't allowed to the appointments or when I give birth, I know he will want to keep the baby and that's just not going to happen.

He went back to his mothers and hasn't texted me since, apparently according to his mother he hasn't stopped crying since.

AITA?"
"AITA for abandoning my bf for surgery? | Backstory:  my bf and I live together bc we have a child together (under 2) and for the time being it’s easier.  We are not in a good place, but trying to work things out.  

My bf was scheduled for minor surgery, and I agreed to take him in and pick him up.  All in all, it apppeared the total time in the surgery facility would be about 3 hours.  He knew nothing about the details, other than generally what they were doing and where/when he had to be there.  Knew nothing about after-care, medication, etc.  
We arrive at the surgery center, and I stay with him to fill out his paperwork, and while he waits for them to call him back.  Seconds before he is called back, I see a sign that says that surgery patients must have someone in the waiting room.  I ask him about this, and he mumbles something and basically plays dumb.  The nurse walks out to call him back and he just stands there so I have to literally tell him to ask her what the situation is.  She says, yes, someone has to be here the whole time.  That was not what was communicated to me, nor what I agreed to.  
I should note, I had surgery myself a little over a week ago, much more invasive than what he is having.  I hadn’t bathed for 2 days, I hadn’t eaten anything, and I had taken (mild) pain medication that morning, as I am still swollen and in a good amount of pain myself.  I was NOT planning on sitting in an uncomfortable waiting room for 3 hours.  
I waited for about 15 minutes in the waiting room, and then got a phone call.  I stepped outside to take the phone call and decided to leave at that point.  
I was irritated that he is consistently acting like an irresponsible child.  I was irritated that he seemingly either didn’t find out or wasn’t forthcoming about the surgery center’s requirement.  
I should note that we live 10 minutes from the surgery center.  We are not married, so I can’t make medical decisions for him, so I’m not sure what purpose it is that I need to stay there.  
I didn’t leave to go do anything fun, I left bc we are 10 minutes away, I am also recovering, and wanted to do so in my own home.  
I also am on short term disability from work.  There is a chance, albeit probably remote, that I could also be penalized for being somewhere for 3 hours that’s not my home or my doctors office.  I’m annoyed that he put me in that position without telling me first.  
A few other notes may or may not be relevant:  
He is on my insurance but will be paying for this himself.  
When I went in for my surgery, my mom took me and picked me up, not him.  She was not required to wait, just to be there when they were done.  (Mine was a total of 6 hours).  This was pre-planned, my mom came in from out of state so that my bf could watch our son (after full day daycare) on surgery day, and so that my bf would have the extra help while I recover.  

I do worry about him and feel bad that I left.  But I am mad that he didn’t bother to find out or specifically omitted the details.  AITA?"
"AITA for not defending partner from threat by my family? | I put the important details that give context to why my sister loathes him enough to threaten him.

I’ve (32F) have known partner (34M) since high school. We dated on and off in college. After a few years apart, we reconnected and started a relationship.5 years in, things are going well. Partner proposes. Wedding plans are made, dress is purchased, deposits are put down on a venue, when my partner totally changes: he gives me the silent treatment, starts harping on my flaws and where we are more different, says we don’t fit but doesn’t break up with me. I’m very emotional throughout, trying to explain how badly I feel and how cold he’s being and what can I do to make things better.  I reach a breaking point after about 5 months of this and return the ring. I move out, devastated.

9 months later, we get back together, he mini re-proposes.  Thenhe falls back into the same pattern as before: silent treatment, cold, emotionally withdrawn, rude and dismissive of how I feel (I’d cry and try again to explain how I was feeling, there was some gaslighting as to nothing occurring like what I was talking about). Then I discovered after 2 months of this that he was cheating: I broke up with him, gave him back the ring and moved out again and started my grad program.

We have slowly been putting the relationship back together after a year (therapy and true horror/repentance on his part). Enter my family: they hate him. After years together they were close with my partner. The first time around they were sad for me and saw how devastated I was (I cried a lot and was pretty depressed during this period). They expressed concern when we got back together. After the second breakup and cheating, they basically think he’s a liar, used up years of my life and played with my love for him and threw it away, and that I am an idiot for trying to go to therapy or forgiving him. I don’t really try to change their views: enough things have occurred that a lot of their feelings are grounded in events and statements and truth.

So at home, my sister sees my partner at an event this evening (they work for the same large company but different buildings/departments).  She hasn’t seen him in probably a year and half. She tells him that if he is fucking with me again, she will destroy him. She texts me about this interaction, as does my partner (he doesn’t go into details).

I feel conflicted. As a partner, I should probably admonish my sister, and my instinct is to apologize to my man on her behalf. But there’s an equal part of me that’s like, my sister’s feelings aren’t invalid or wrong, and my partner made this mess and did lie and cheat, so while he doesn’t deserve threats, it’s reasonable that he would receive them

TLDR: AITA if I don’t check my sister and family generally for issuing threats to my partner in light of the fact he lied, cheated, and was emotionally abusive?"
"AITA for telling this girl the reason her boyfriend left her is because she’s so mean? | I started my first job recently and was hired along with 3 other girls, including one we’ll call Natalie. Since we were all new, we started eating lunch together every day. Pretty soon, I got the feeling that Natalie didn’t like me. I’ve always been more quiet and sometimes say the wrong thing in a effort to say anything at all, which probably makes some people see me as weird. It’s something I’ve tried to overcome and it’s always been a struggle. 

Anyway, Natalie has started treating me not as friendly but still bare minimum polite since we’re all at work. I know not everyone is going to like me so I’m not going to lose any sleep over it. But I still try to get along and be professional with everyone. Lately, Natalies been more rude to me. One example: I was in the breakroom alone, waiting for them to meet me for lunch and a guy comes in to use the vending machines. The girls get to the room and sit down as he picks up his snack. He turns to say hi to us and introduces himself as one of the higher ups and jokingly but cheerfully says to me “you seemed quiet and I’m glad you now have a group to eat with”. Natalie said in a condescending tone, “I’m surprised she even said anything to you”. I was so embarrassed that I clammed up and said nothing the rest of lunch.  A few more incidents like that happened and each time, I grew more and more upset. 

Last week, Natalie told us that her boyfriend is moving to another state for a job and she’s devastated. Later that day, the 2 of us were assigned to some filing. I gathered up some folders to file and Natalie pointed to a cabinet while my back was turned. I asked her, “which one? I didn’t see where you pointed”. She glared at me and said in a low, mean voice “it’s right there, OP”. I’d had enough. I said “I’ve always been nice to you, why are you so nasty to me? It’s no wonder BF left you”. Nat stormed out and now won’t even look at me. The other girls think I’m TA, so Reddit, AITA?

Update: After taking some time to cool off I realized that I was definitely in the wrong here and I’m feeling very badly. I sent her an email profusely apologizing and that I only said it out of anger from some of our previous interactions. I’m planning on leaving a gift card for a coffee place she likes on her desk tomorrow morning with another note saying sorry. Hopefully we can move on from that but it’s definitely been a good lesson for me. Thanks for all the feedback"
"AITA for refusing to go to my best friends wedding because I’m not a groomsman? | Some backstory to start with... we became really good friends my freshman year of college. We were inseparable and spent a lot of time together. Nick had been with his gf Krista for years at that point, high school sweethearts. I became great friends with both of them, and his gf’s friends. It was a really good first year of college. The next year of school we lived together in an apt. I winded up not getting a bid to his fraternity that year. It was a really big deal for many reasons, but its a long story. To sum things up, it really affected me personally and it changed our relationship. We started hanging out less, and I hated living in our apt which was basically an annex house for the fraternity... living there even though I wasn’t in it.

That year he graduated. We still kept in touch, and 2 years have passed since then. We talk intermittently, but to be quite honest with you I have put more effort in than he has. One weekend he said he was coming to visit, but then the alumni event for his fraternity got cancelled so he didn’t come. I asked him why he couldnt have came just to see me, no response. I texted him happy birthday a few months ago, no response. He didnt text me on my birthday either. I’ve asked him to come up multiple times since. No response. It sucks.

Still, I consider him to be one of my best friends even though we don’t see each other that much. Krista told me while we were in school that he’s never been as close with a friend like me... I was one of his few best friends he’s ever had. The wedding is this summer and I recently got an invitation. I went to the wedding website, and he has 10 groomsmen. None of them are me. He could have at the very least given me a heads up and let me know why that was the situation, but he didn’t. Most of the bridesmaids I was pretty good friends with. His groomsmen... for the most part... are all people I know for a fact he wasn’t that close with. His best man is his cousin and I know they weren’t SUPER close.

I think if I had gotten a bid to the fraternity the relationship would be different. It’s really sad. Its hard to put in perspective why it was a big deal on reddit, but it really was. I don’t think I can show up to the wedding by myself and not be involved. I would be extremely awkward, uncomfortable, and left out. Is it selfish of me to not attend? I just cant ignore how hurt and disappointed I am. 

If I did tell him how I felt, I wouldn’t lash out with anger. I’d just tell him I love you, I wish you and your wife the best, however this is how I feel and I’m not coming

TLDR; Best friend from college has failed to upkeep the friendship with me, but I have tried hard. He invites me to the wedding but doesn’t make me a groomsman even though it seems like it would be a given. Butthurt and disappointed, is it selfish of me to not go entirely?"
"AITA for calling Child Protective Services? | I was at a social event this evening hosted by my wife's friend/coworker. During the party, one of the other attendees frantically runs into the kitchen to wet a towel. Turns out, another couple there left their 3 year-old daughter in the car for nearly 40 minutes on a day when it was 93 degrees outside. They only realized their mistake when another sibling was playing outside and heard the 3-year-old screaming. They were attentive to the child and sought advice from an MD at the party. They did not call 911 and they remained there for another 90 mins-2 hours after discovering her in the car, which I thought was odd. 

&#x200B;

The parents were clearly shaken up about their mistake. Based on short conversations with people who know them well, they are well-intentioned parents. However, they are fostering kids and in total have six biological or foster kids, I believe all under the age of 13. Mom stays at home but receives no outside assistance. Based on what I witnessed tonight, I have serious concerns about whether the parents have the capacity and resources to raise six kids in a safe and supportive environment. I believe it might be in the best interests of the kids for an outside agency to appraise their welfare. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, as we were leaving the party I noticed a text from a friend who was there with us but did not know anyone else. She asked us to call her. She's an extremely non-confrontational person, but she basically said that if we didn't call CPS she was going to do it herself. I said I would do it, and my wife protested mildly, acknowledging that it was our right to call but believing it was not necessary or helpful, as she fears the parents facing sanction, especially the risk of them losing out on the opportunity to adopt their fostered children. 

&#x200B;

I called CPS when I got home. I gave them an incident report and they said ""these are very serious allegations."" However, I was missing certain details (e.g. home address of where the incident occurred) that prevented me from formally submitting the report. In the time after I spoke to them, it occurred to me that there is a significant complication to proceeding with the report. My wife and almost everyone at that party are medical professionals, and therefore mandated reporters. My report and the failure of others to report could cause problems for my wife's coworkers and friends who ostensibly did nothing wrong. 

&#x200B;

I really don't want to go ahead with the report now. However, I asked my wife and her friends to confront the father (their coworker tomorrow) and have an honest conversation about whether the family has the capacity to support all of those kids. My wife doesn't want to do it and her friends are pissed at me for calling CPS in the first place. Did I fuck up?"
"AITA for following orders while babysitting someone my age. | Hello! Long time viewer here! Throwaway for obvious reasons. Posted on mobile, so sorry for any errors.

I (14M) am in 8th grade, and David (13M) is in my grade. We share a lot of classes, but have never gotten to know each other. I have been doing babysitting for quite a while now. I started doing it for extra money, because the only thing I have to do is watch over some child, and I can do my homework while babysitting. One of my clients, on Sunday, asked me if I could babysit their neighbor’s kid from 6 to 10PM. I didn’t know who I was babysitting, but I agreed to do it.

I got to their home, and to my shock, I found out that I was babysitting David. His parents seemed very strange. (Why would someone need to hire a babysitter for a 13 year old??) They gave me a schedule of everything that David was supposed to do, and I was supposed to enforce it. From 6 to 8, he had to do his homework, from 8 to 9, I had to open up a safe with a combination his parents gave me, give David his phone, and watch over him to make sure he doesn’t do anything inappropriate on it. If he decided to go to the bathroom, I had to ask to take his phone. At 9, I had to take his phone, put it back in the safe, and make him read a book. At 10PM, his parents would return. I had to make sure that he didn’t curse at all, and if he did, I should report it to his parents.

I know that his parents seem very controlling, however I am just a babysitter, so I decided to follow the rules. I already did my homework, so I just read Reddit while he did his homework. He asked multiple times, to give him his phone or the passcode for the safe. I refused to do that. He started complaining that I was his classmate, and that I am an asshole for treating him like a kid.  I reminded him that he wasn’t allowed to curse. I also refrained from cursing. At 8, I opened up the safe, and gave him his phone. I followed him, and told him that I had to look at his screen. He said F*** you. At around 8:45 he tried to run to the bathroom, but I told him to give me his phone. He did that, and got pissed as ever. He spent a while in the bathroom, and at 9 I put his phone back in the safe. He came out like 5 minutes later and yelled at me, because I took his phone. I gave him his book, and reminded him that he had to read it. Finally, his parents returned.

They asked me if he did anything bad, and I said that he said F*** you to me, and called me an asshole. They thanked me, gave me the money, and I left. The next day, he looked extremely pissed at school, and his friend called me a dick, among other things.

Not sure if I am the asshole here. From my point of view, I just followed orders. I don’t hate David, I just want my money. Now, it is your time to decide if I am an asshole, or if I am not an asshole.

Edit: thanks a lot for the great feedback! I saw both points of view. Just to clarify a few things: I didn’t know that I was going to babysit him, until I was in his house and talking to his parents. Also, David is only 2 months younger than me. His original babysitter couldn’t come, so his parents asked the neighbor for a babysitter, who asked me. They asked me that around 30 minutes before I was supposed to start. Also, they paid me a lot more than my usual rate, because I am 14 while their original babysitter was an adult, and they gave me the adult’s rate.

Edit 2: Well it seems to be split halfway. A lot of people are calling the parents assholes, some are calling David the asshole, some are calling me the asshole. Someone even called the neighbor the asshole. A lot have told me to refuse babysitting this kid again. I thank all of you for your advice, because it really helped me get a 3rd person POV about this issue. I will probably apologize to David tomorrow at school."
"AITA for giving my friend my ""brutally honest opinion"" on him hanging out with highschoolers. | EDIT: PLEASE READ THE QUESTION. I'm not asking if you agree with my opinion, I'm asking if I'm an asshole for giving it. 


Close mate of mine just got out of a relationship around the same time I did, so we've been supporting eachother through our pains and bullshit. He mentioned something to me about how he felt like he needed to hang out with friends more often and I agreed with him, because he really closed in on himself during his breakup. 


My buddy is 19, we graduated last year. For some reason, the only people he hangs out with are highschoolers??  


I mean, I can see it. not to rag on the guy but in all realness, he's pretty immature; no job, parents paying for college in full, lives at home with no fees and he even still recieves an allowance. (all things I've noticed as weird but wrote them off because they have no impact on me at all lmao) 


None of these things have meant anything, until recently, he got kinda worried about his image and asked me if it was weird that he's hanging out with these people. He also asked me to be as brutally honest as possible, because, in his words I am ""more mature and I know more about this stuff"" than he does. 


I said I understood where he was coming from, him and his GF were pretty much eachothers best friend, and these people he's hanging out with are from the same club we were all in in highschool, and some of them are people we went to school with for a year or so, and it's always cool to talk to people with similar interests-


-but I also told him my honest opinion, which is that by hanging out with people who are up to 4 years younger then you, you aren't going to learn from them and you aren't challenging yourself. I basically said they're probably cool to hang out with but you've gotta adult sometimes, and that's not possible if you're spending all of your time hanging out with 16 year olds and going to class. 

He got mad at me and called me an asshole and said I was jealous that he had friends 


lolwut 


he then told me that ""this is why /ex BF/ left me"" and ""don't talk to him ever again""

yikes man, I was just trying to be real. 
Thanks if you read this far. opinions/feedback appreciated. 

TL:DR - Friend is going through breakup and associates with highschoolers as his sole friend group. He asks for my ""brutally honest"" opinion, I tell him it's alright that they're his friends but that he's not gonna progress if he continues to associate with them in this way, he gets mad, tells me never to talk to him again.

"WIBTA if I Spike My Shampoo With Hair Dye? | Technically not me, but my boyfriend's, but he doesn't have an account, so here goes:

We live in shared housing on campus. Most of my housemates are friends, but one of them moved in later on and we're not very close to her. She's usually drunk and when she has her friends over, we can't get any sleep because of all the noise she makes. We sometimes find her passed out on the top her mountain of stuff in her room that she never cleans. She (or her friends) had also stolen the sandwiches I'd packed before a day out (which I found out after I'd gone out).

Recently, my other housemate had noticed that her shampoo had been going down more than she was using it. By process of elimination, we guessed that it was probably that housemate. We are quite done with her shit by now, and we're thinking of spiking some shampoo in an opaque bottle with hair dye to teach her a lesson. If it doesn't go in her hair, at least her hands will be coloured.

So, in doing this, AITA?

Edit: Due to valid concerns, her hair is dyed. It would be unlikely that she's allergic to substances she's already used.

Edit #2: Yes, hair dye might not be the best idea. We *are* looking at the alternatives you guys are suggesting. We don't want to do damage, just send a message that she needs to stop.

Edit #3: Pasting one of my replies for visibility:

We've talked to her about it, kind of harder to forget when you've stumbled out to the kitchen at 3 in the morning after a 12 hour shift (medical student, so he does regular training in medical facilities) to a bunch of drunk people howling and pounding the kitchen table in.

Right now she's got friends in her room, door's closed and we can hear her howling in the opposite end of the place with our door closed. 

We've also talked to her about the sandwich, she blames it on her friends (that she doesn't control or take responsibility for). My boyfriend's only plate (heyyy student life) was also ""loaned"" once and he couldn't have his daily cereal. He caught her a few days later trying to sneak it back to the kitchen, which when confronted, she broke down into tears.

She's also left Indian food in her room once, for half a week. The entire house stank of rotting food and then her cloying perfume because she thought that was a good idea.

She's only been here about one and a half months. We're quite tired.

We're not going to put Nair in the shampoo because we're not that cruel, but she needs to stop, and she doesn't own up when we ask her about things."
"AITA for not accepting my partners apology? | Context: My partner is usually a really great guy, he works hard and is supportive of my persobal goals, but I feel like he is very hands off with the baby. On the days where he works I don't care as much but on his days off he still leaves 90 percent of childcare to me.if we are both home I am the one that feeds her, changes her, puts her down for naps and chases after her if she leaves the room to get into shenanigans.

The issue: Today the three of us were sitting on the bed and we were playing with the baby. I had my hand on the baby's knee and was keeping her from rolling over since we were close the the edge of the bed and it was kind of cute and funny how she'd respond to it by growling and kicking her legs, she was smiling and laughing at the same time so I know I wasn't doing anything horrible to her. He told me I was being mean. So I blew him off and put the baby down on the floor to play and I went and sat in another area and watched the baby play. It hurt my feelings for him to say that because already I feel like I dont get to have any fun with her. I am always the one that feeds her and changes her ect while he gets to have all the snuggles and play time.  He came around like 2 hours later and said he was sorry for teasing me, but he didnt feel that it warranted further discussion. I told him that It was fine and that I probably just got bent out of shape because I felt like it was rude to call me mean since I do 90 percent of the baby care if we are both home. He didnt say anything in response to that and just walked away and went downstairs. Btw guess whos watching the baby while he has his coffee uninterrupted? 

Should I have just not said anything? Was I the asshole?"
"AITA for giving my kids a ""dress code"" for homeschool? | I have two daughters, aged 12 and 10, and I homeschool both of them. This school year, I decided to implement a ""dress code"" for school time. Towards the end of last school year, things got kind of tough. They'd frequently want to do school in their pajamas, and I didn't see a problem with it until they stopped doing their school work, got distracted, went back to sleep in the middle of schoolwork. We ended up getting behind by the end of the school year and had to supplement by doing school over the weekends and into the summer, which the girls weren't pleased about. 

&#x200B;

This year, I decided to implement a ""dress code"" for homeschool. They are no longer allowed to do school in their pajamas. To really drive home the point, I bought some school skirts and tops for them to wear while doing school. I don't make them wear these every day, just on days when we have a lot of work to be done. I have found them to be a lot more focused and productive. My 10 year old loves her school outfit, my 12 year old not so much, but as we're at home most of the day, she doesn't mind too much.

&#x200B;

I've discussed this with some other homeschool moms, and I got a mix response, some think it's a good idea and others think that I should have asked the girls before implementing it and that I'm too strict. AITA?"
"AITA for letting my friend leave because he used the decorative towels in the bathroom? | A friend of mine came into town and has been staying at my place for a few days before heading to his next location.

I am in the process of buying a washer and dryer so when he got here in last night, he asked for a towel to shower with and I let him know I had to go to the laundromat in the am and would he be alright to use the towel he had used last night.

He said okay.

Fast forward to him getting out of the shower and he comes out telling me that he made an executive decision to not use his towel and instead use the towels in the bathroom and how they felt much nicer than the other towel anyway.

I was legit confused because there were no other towels in the bathroom.

It took a few seconds for me to realize that he must have meant the decorative towels.

I have a really pretty expensive grey towel, folded neatly with a smaller white towel that has elaborate designs to match the bathroom hanging underneath a picture.

I have had these decorative towels for about a year now, undisturbed. Guests come and go, never had an issue messing with these towels, but anyway.

I was a bit annoyed so I let him know that those towels were decorative towels and they weren't meant to be used, that's why they had stayed so nice.

He proceeds to tell me that towels are towels where he's from and where he's from people use the towels in the house because that's what towels are for.

I told him that I get that, but when he asked me for a towel, if I wanted him to use that towel I would have gave it to him.

He then says 'Well that's the point of an executive decision.""

He then starts talking to my cat about how much better the towel felt and how decorative towels are an oxymoron.

I tell him that's not really the point but I can feel my irritation rising as I see the towels crumpled on the floor so I tell him that I am just going to stop and finish journaling. ( I am working on being more present and less reactive and journaling helps.)

As a result, he immediately gets angry and tells me that he will just leave then.

I say okay and that makes him angrier, he says, ""I can't believe you are just going to let me leave over towels, I said I was sorry.""

Except he didn’t say he was sorry and honestly, I wouldn't have even wanted an apology.

I was annoyed at his dismissive and incredulous tone about me having decorative towels and choosing not to use them.

By this time, I am honestly just shocked that HE is mad.

It wasn't a big deal until I said, ""Okay, you know what, I am telling you that I am just going to finish journaling instead of getting into a shouting match over towels.""

He screams out, ""Well, I am not as good a communicator as you.""

I don't know what to say so I say okay,

I told him that I wasn't going to beg him to stay, if he wanted to leave then, by all means, have at it and I go back to journaling.

He grabs his stuff and leaves in a huff. We haven't talked since.

AITA for letting my friend leave over his use of the decorative towels?"
"AITA for refusing to not wear a shirt my dad doesn't like because he does the same | couldn't fit the whole story into the title so please hear me out

i (17m) admittedly a big anime and pop culture snob. my dad hates this about me and he likes popular culture, action movies all that stuff. that isnt to say i dont enjoy star wars or marvel or sports, i can watch  those, but when i talk to my sister or friends about shows and anime we are justifiably discussing and complaining about what is good and what is not.

he hates this, so he went out and bought an anime shirt of one of the anime we criticized  at the time. the shirt is a big picture of the main character and he wears it ALL THE TIME when out with me. the anime is childish and aimed at young boys, and its true i don't like the anime, but it would not be a big deal if he didn't constantly act smug and talk about it all the time. he doesn't watch it or know anything about it, but just talks in very general stereotypes about anime and ""nerds"" in genearl and does it clearly just to annoy or embarrass my friends and i. 

i asked him if he would stop wearing it and talking about it all the time but he refused and told me to ""lighten up"". i asked how he would feel if i did the same to him, and he said he wouldn't care because he can ""take a joke"". so in response i bought a shirt that supported the church of scientology. i wore it under a hoodie and then revealed it in public, and he told me to change immediately. he said people will think he's indoctrinating my sister and i into a cult religion. i said maybe he should lighten up and he got really angry and said it wasn't the same.

so reddit AITA for essentially doing what my dad did to me?"
"AITA for refusing my brother's invitation to Christmas at his house? | For context, my husband and I have 4 kids together. His mother passed away, but even before that we did not have much interaction with his family. 

My mother passed away 8 years ago. I don't interact much with my sisters (one took off to Florida years ago after abandoning 3 of her children and is in and out of prison and the other is not a nice person.) My oldest sibling and only brother, we'll call him J, is my only close family. He raised me along with two of his own children. I love him and his wife, L, rediculously.

Now here's the issue: his wife's family has always taken precedence in his eyes. When I was younger and living with them I was always included but not made to *feel* included. Christmas meant watching L and J's kids get tons of presents from their aunts and uncles (L is one of 6, and then their extended family too). L and J always got me something, so no big deal and I was a teenager anyway so it didn't really matter.

Then I had my own kids. My brother and I grew apart. I stopped doing birthday parties for my kids because other than J and L, we had no family to invite. They never wanted to come to my house for holiday dinners because L's mom (and now L) does the dinner thing. Eventually they stopped buying presents for my kids even though we still brought stuff for theirs. Invites to their functions became more and more belated until they stopped altogether.


A couple days ago I shared a meme on Facebook about family sticking together and all of a sudden I get a message from J about how we should come over for Christmas dinner. I politely declined and he pushed for a reason why. So I told him that not only do we have our own dinner planned and traditions that we observe, I didn't feel comfortable making my children go through another year of watching their cousins open piles of gifts from L's family while mine sit there with nothing. He was angry and blocked me after telling me that I was ungrateful for everything he and L had done for me.

 I understand that Christmas isn't about the presents and my children should be grateful to spend time with family, but here's the thing. They only ever get presents from me and their dad. We're not rich, so they don't really get a lot to begin with, but they are extremely grateful for what they do recieve. 

I'm just tired of watching my kids feel hurt because their cousins have more family than they do, basically.

Am I the asshole?

**Edit:** For clarity, my brother and his wife raised me. Her family is very closeknit, and I've been involved with them since I moved in with my brother at 12yo. I'm 35 now. 

What I'm really upset about, I guess, is realizing that me and my kids aren't really as much a part of that family as I had always been told.

It is the feeling that while these ""family members"" were out picking out gifts for people they love, no one thought of my kids. There are other things that contribute to this, not least of which is that my brother didn't bother to even message my kids on their birthdays this year."
"AITA for taking my kids (3,4) to see The Lion King? | Took the kids with my wife to see the lion king today for a 12:30 pm showing. We were thinking, “it’s day time, it’s a kids movie, surely there’s no problem with that?” I guess we thought wrong. The very enthusiastic people to our left were very excited about every cute moment, constantly going, “awwwwww” at every “cute” moment. No big deal, except later, when my kid had questions about the death of Mufasa the girl in this couple starts sighing very loudly and grabbing her face. I tried to redirect my son to stay quiet and calm, but he had too many questions. She continued sighing and grabbing her face in annoyance, and I took my son out of the theater. 

I talked to my son, reminded him of the expectation to stay quiet, distracted him by walking around the lobby for five or ten minutes, and then I returned.  My son started talking again, the girl started sighing again, and so I told my wife we should probably just leave. I turned to the sighing girl, and told her, “don’t worry, we are leaving”. She ignored me in the awkwardness of the moment, so I tapped the armrest and repeated myself until she gave me a nod. I got up with my son, and left. My wife collected our belongings and brought my other son to the lobby. According to my wife, the girl seemed distraught after me leaving, and needed to be consoled by her partner. 

My wife and I are very conscious about where we take our boys. We don’t go to restaurants unless they’re family friendly.  We don’t sit them at weddings or funerals unless we can have an aisle seat, and even then, we may not bring them. We take them out immediately. 

So, AITA for taking my kids to a kids movie and expecting that others were a little more tolerant?

"AITA for not wanting to meet my half sister | Sorry if the format is bad I'm on mobile

So I (18F) have a half sister (I believe shes 13) and I recently kinda started talking to my dad again starting back in 2018ishhhhh. 

(I say kinda because he sometimes ghost me and I sometimes ghost him for like a 1-3months at a time)

So he asked for my Instagram last time we talked and I gave it to him and he gave it to my half sister.

(A little side note here I've never met her in my 18yrs of life, I've never talked to her personally, when I was younger and had scheduled calls with my dad he would try and put her on the phone but my mom didn't allow it, all I know is her name and age) 

So back to the main point, after my dad gave her my Instagram she followed me and messaged me asking if we could connect and start talking maybe visit each other, how my dad had given her a ton of pictures of me that she has hanging up on her wall, how shes heard so much about me, etc.
 (I've  barely talked to my dad before 2018ish, so idk what he told her when the man barely knows me), and idk how he got pics of me when we aren't friends  on Facebook and my Facebook is set to private)

I messaged her back how I didnt feel comfortable with talking to her/getting to know her right now and how I was just kinda getting to know our dad and also how I found it a little bit strange that she has pictures of me hanging up on her wall when shes never met me

She then tells our dad about how I dont want to meet her at all or talk to her and he gets mad at me because we're sisters and we should be super close with each other, 
this is were I might be the asshole

I told him no we aren't sisters, we are half sisters. I didnt grow up with this girl so I dont consider her my sister. How I found it really fucked up he gave her pics of me and told her a bunch of stuff about me that probably wasn't even fucking true. 

He called me an asshole and hasn't talked to me for about a month now. 

So reddit am I the asshole?"
"AITA for wanting my wife to not take an unpaid research year and delay her graduation? | Throwaway account because my wife knows my user name. My wife and I have been together for 10 years, and married for four. She went back to school three years ago to become a doctor. She’s just finishing up her third year of medical school and considering taking a year off to do research instead of graduating next year. She wants to do a competitive specialty (Plastic surgery) And thinks that taking a year to do research will help her match into the specialty.

Unfortunately the year of research will be unpaid and delay her graduation by a year. I currently work as a computer programmer and have been supporting her through medical school. I was looking forward to her starting to work so that we could have a dual income and start enjoying life. Would I be the asshole if I asked her to graduate next year instead of taking the year to do research? She might be able to do plastic surgery without taking an extra year but it would be harder for her to do it without the research year. If she graduated next year she might have to do a different specialty that she might not like as much. When I brought this up with her she was upset saying that this is her career and that one year might enable her to do what she wants to do. Am I the asshole for being frustrated here? I I want to buy our first house and start having kids and really don’t wanted to delay this by another year. Thanks in advance reddit!"
"AITA for asking my sister to give me $14 for 2/3 beers that she drank on my $85 tab even though the bartender hooked me up and only charged me for 1 beer? | My sister (21) and I (26) are out the other night with friends for the fight. She asks me to get her a beer ($7) and put it on my tab and that she would give me money later. No problem.
She ends up getting 2 more beers ($14) on my tab. (Total $21 plus tip) 
Meanwhile I had 3 drinks ($40)
and I bought 3 shots for her, her friend and myself. (Which were on me $18) 
When I went to close the tab out it came out to $65 and I noticed that he only charged me for one beer (bartender is a friend so he hooked it up) I tipped him $20 and the total was $85.
I told my sister that he only charged me for 1 beer but asked her to give me $14 which would have essentially been the price of a  second beer or just tip. 
To which she responded ""why would I pay for 2 beers if he only charged you for 1. If you can't afford to pay the tab you shouldn't have gotten so much"" 
I explained to her that even though he charged me for 1 of her drinks he charged me for all of mine and she said that wasn't her problem. 
On a side note if he would have given me any of the shots or my drinks for free I wouldn't have asked her for the price of all of her beers.

She ended up sending me $14 but said that I was still wrong.

Who is the asshole?

Edit: clarified the prices of drinks."
"AITA for buying my wife a Roomba for Christmas? | This happened last year but since it still gets brought up during arguments every now and then and I just discovered this Subreddit I decided to check what you guys think.

Me and my wife have two children (15F & 11M). My wife is a stay at home mom since the birth of our second child. I (46M) work full time and earn a six figure salary. My job is highly stressful, requires me to travel a lot and mostly sleep in hotels. I only get to come home to my family on every second weekend, on average. Despite working a lot, I am glad to do it so that my family can live a comfortable life.

Last year, I decided to buy my wife a Roomba for Christmas. My wife tends to be the one who vacuums the house so I presumed that she would like this present as it would free her of this chore.

As she unpacked the present, she was heavily offended and did not hesitate to show it, which made the whole situation quite uncomfortable as my parents and other members of the family were also present. She argued that 'this should not be a present directed at her but at the whole family, as it is the entire family’s responsibility to clean up the house'.

Since I work and am the sole source of income in the family and she is a stay at home mother, I think it is apparent that she should take on responsibilities such as taking care of the kids and maintaining the house. The gift was intended to somewhat relieve her of this burden. I, personally, would have loved to have received a Christmas gift that would have somehow made it possible for me to spend less time working. As cheesy as it sounds, I think that time is one of the most precious gifts and that Roomba would have definitely bought some time for her - time that she could use to do whatever she pleased instead of vacuuming. 

Unfortunately, one year later, this still often gets brought up during arguments, often coupled with her crying.

So, AITA in this situation?

EDIT: I should also add that I would have never gifted my wife a vacuum cleaner or anything along these lines. I saw the Roomba as a robot that would fully take over this task which is why I thought it was a good idea.

EDIT #2: I asked her numerous times before Christmas last year what she would have liked to receive and she repeatedly told me that she does not want anything. I was left to guess and chose the most practical gift that I was certain she could be able to make use of."
"AITA for feeling less and less like trying to have a relationship with my son? | I divorced the mother of my son when he was 5. He's now 17.

We used to see each other daily, but honestly weren't super close since he entered adolescence, and used to only bond over a couple shared interests. 

2 years ago, I had an offer to move to a different country for work. Since my son was old enough to maintain contact online and come visit, I took the opportunity.
Before moving, I asked how he felt about it, and he said it was fine by him.

Since then, I have been the only one trying to establish contact. He responds monosyllabicaly to my texts and always claims to be busy when I try to set up video calls.

Now, I understand teenagers are not super excited to talk to their parents, so I don't resent him in any way. But I'm kinda tired of being the only one trying, so I've been trying less and less. 

I don't plan on cutting him off of my life, I just feel like waiting for him to show a little bit more interest in having a relationship with me before putting more energy into it. 

AITA for feeling this way?"
"AITA for breaking up with a guy because he watches anime? | I kind of have this rule where I don't date guys who are into anime, like if they watch one or two really popular shows or the well known movies that's one thing but the ones who watch a ton and new shows every season that's another. 

I mostly just do this because it wields out the weeaboos who'd fetishize me for being half Japanese. Usually I ask this relatively early on and with the guy I'd been seeing the last two months I had too, he then had acted like he didn't know much about it and mentioned how he had seen the Ghibli films though. 

However recently I found out that he's actually very much into it. I wasn't snooping but accidentally I found on his computer a folder with a lot of rips of shows and another one where he had saved art of anime girls and stuff like that. Save to say he's pretty into it but lied to me about it because he knew it would make a bad impression, and he's right as I do have that rule. 

So I decided to break it off, mostly because he lied to me but to be honest if he had been honest I wouldn't have dated him in the first place.

AITA?"
AITA for telling my wife she's wrong for kicking our son out for drugs? | My wife has kicked out our 17 year old son out of the house for catching him with drugs. He has been dabbling in cocaine a fair use and we have a 4 year old daughter too who lives with us. My wife found out he has been using cocaine in our house by his cousins Snapchats. She has now thrown him out the of the house because she is worried for our daughter. Keep in mind she found no drugs in his room or the house. I argued it's.wrong for kicking him without finding any drugs in the house or on him. He is now living with a friend. AITA telling her she is overreacting?
"AITA for refusing to do the dishes? | So just for some context.. I am 20F, and i currently work and provide for my mother who has difficulty with movement and frequent pains in her hips and bones. People living in the house include my younger sister (15 yrs old), my older sister (27 yrs old and also working) and her 3 children (2 yr M, 4 yr M, 8yr F). My mother baby sits the three children while my older sister and I are at work. I go to work at around 8AM and get home by at least 4pm mon-fri. When i get home, the house is usually a WRECK, and i sometimes find my mom trying to clean whilst watching all three of my sisters children. Meanwhile my younger sister is on her phone on the third floor of the house doing absolutely nothing. Don't get me wrong, my mother is a proud grandmother and offered to watch my sisters children, so it's not as though the task is forced on her. Even turning down a baby sitter which was offered numerous times. One day after a very long and frustrating day of work I get home to the house as usual a total mess from the children and as my older sister doesn't get home until later, its just my mother and the children home atm. My mom asked me to do the dishes and something in me just.. Snapped. The conversation goes as follows 

Mom: Honey can you do the dishes? I've been a little busy today. 

Me: where the heck is younger sibling? 

Mom: oh she asked to go to a friends house so i just let her go to get her out of my hair 

Me:...you do realize its her day to do the dishes today, yeah? 

Mom: I just needed some quiet time. Why cant you just do it?

Me: mom im 20 yrs old and i dont get to even have personal time until ALL my chores are done. And these aren't my chores. So no.. I wont do them. 

From there i called younger sibling and had her come all the way back home to do them, and as it was now 9PM it was too late to go back out. She says im the A-hole and my mom said it was petty. So I just wanna know.. AITA? 

Just wanted to address a few things instead of answering to every comment (which i appreciated no matter how rude) 

1. Yes there was a handful of better ways I could have handled this situation, and I now realize that. Tomorrow morning I will be apologizing and discussing some house rules to help at least maintain things while my sister and I are working. I admit i shouldn't have let work place frustrations harm my relationships at home. 

2. A lot of people are kinda blaming my older sister for ""dumping the kids"" on my mother. We've had countless discussions and even going behind my mothers back to get the children a babysitter (which we found quite a few well qualified ones) but mom heavily protests against it. Not sure why, but i am the child she is the parent and I nor my older sister can change the things she wants unfortunately.  

3. Having the dishes as a chore one day out of the week shouldn't be a problem for a 15 year old. At that age for both my sister and i we had an entire week of chores that included dishes, laundry, and yard work. And we HATED IT. so to give her a sense of responsibility, she has ONE day out of the week. That way she has time to leave the house and get her own personal time (she's a teen. She DEFIANTLY needs it.)  
 

I will be updating the outcome of our conversations tomorrow, and thank you once again for all of you guys insight on the situation. It means a lot to me. 

Update! I'm on my hour lunch at work so im gonna try and make this quick. We had a nice long discussion this morning. The discussions consisted of how everyone was feeling and what we can switch around to make a healthy change for everyone. I proceeded with giving out an apology to both my little sister and mother, as there was a better way to handle things and i shouldn't have gotten so frustrated. I vented on how I feel mom can be a bit more stern, which was agreed upon and we know have house rules updated. 
1. Before you leave finish chores and homework
2. Leave all outside stress, OUTSIDE. 
3. There will be a close friend whom we are paying to come over and assist with the house. 
They may not be baby sitting but they'll lend a hand in cleaning and any additional baby sitting things that she needs assistance in. 
As an apology to my younger sibling I offered to take her out to an arcade Saturday and she said yes! So I'm excited that she forgives me. I don't believe that I was the a-hole, but i believe calling her all the way back was a petty move. And I feel like without this situation happening we wouldn't have progressed. So I guess in a weird way im thankful? Idk. Please comment anything you'd like to ask and I'll try my best to answer as im In work. Thank you all!"
"AITA Steakhouse walkout | I took my wife out for valentine's dinner a couple of years ago to a Middleton's steakhouse (UK). It was lunchtime and there were 3 tables taken when we got there. I had never been to a Middleton's steakhouse but all my friends highly recommended so thought I'll give it a go. We ordered a starter drinks and our main, the starter came in a timely manner as did the drinks. All going well so far, so we then waited 1 hour 20 minutes I had mentioned a couple of times about the wait and the waitress was apologetic. Then the food arrived and oh my god! I went for a premium steak and got the grisliest piece of steak ever. I'm not kidding my face grew a six pack after the workout of chewing. 

So I complained explained I will pay for everything else just not the steak as it is uneatable. The waitress said I can get another one for you. I replied with I don't have another hour to wait. She said she would get me the manager to issue me the refund. 20 minutes later no manager, I'm looking around and everyone else is looking for where there orders are all building up to the conclusion of me saying to my wife f##k this we're leaving. We walked towards the door and the manager was there with the waitress. The waitress said to the manager that's the man, I straight up said you had your chance to make this right and you lost it. We left and never returned since."
"WIBTA for dancing at daytime and telling my downstairs neighbor he's overreacting? | Hey everyone,

for context: I'm a dancer and due to classes that I teach & various contests, I've been dancing in my flat since I moved in. First time my downstairs neighbor complained: I was dancing with shoes on (for better friction) and full power, my downstairs neighbor came ringing my doorbell saying the steps were too loud. That was his first complaint in the 1 year that I've been living here (Might be that he just moved in, not sure). Totally understandable so I stopped.

Next day, I danced in socks and only at 50% power to respect my neighbor's wishes, and again he rang the doorbell and this time he completely lost his mind, telling me that a home is only for sleeping and resting, I'm not supposed to use it for anything else and that if I want to dance then I will have to rent a dance club. Keep in mind I dance in the afternoon, around 3pm - 7pm, and only for maybe 30 - 45  minutes maximum at a time which is - in my opinion - a totally acceptable time for tolerating a little bit of noise. My upstairs/next door neighbors play instruments, regularly do drilling or listen to loud music which tbh doesn't really bother me and I know it's not a day-long thing - plus, I respect their hobbies and interests so I let them be. Also, it's in the noon or afternoon which is fine to me. 

No one's ever complained about it before, the music is non-hearable, I legitimately only do tippy taps and I really need the mirror in my flat to keep pursuing my hobby. I think he's really overreacting and just forcing his bad mood on me, because the steps are bearly hearable. I do believe I am entitled to a few dB a day. WIBTA to tell him off?"
"AITA for worrying my boyfriend the night before a big job interview, by running out at midnight to help a friend? | I was at home last night. My boyfriend had an important job interview today, and he asked me to keep the noise down so he could sleep. He had to be up early in the morning and needed sleep.

I got a text at midnight from my friend Jess, who lives nearby and doesn't have a car. She said ""op, help, I think I'm being followed home"" 

I texted back right away I'd call 911, and asked her to share her live location with me using Messenger. I called them from the apartment, and was frustrated they didn't seem to be taking it too seriously. They asked why she thought she was in danger, even asked if she's prone to overreact. I didn't have all that information, only a few texts.

The dispatcher said he could have an officer stop by to check on her ""within the hour"" which seemed horribly slow to me. I hung up and decided to go pick her up myself. I quickly got a fire arm from our safe, get my keys, and got in my truck. 

I got to her location in under 5 minutes, and let her into my truck. She said that when I got there, the guy was still following her, turn for turn, but got scarce when I came speeding over. 

I had no regrets about going to get her. We don't know what the guy was trying, but it all seemed suspicious enough that we filed a police report when they finally decided to make an appearance...

I got a text a while after I'd left, from my boyfriend, he was really stressed to wake up to see the safe empty, the truck gone, and me gone with it, at 1 am. I called him and told him I'd been worried about Jess but it was all ok now.

He got mad that I'd run out over nothing (???) on the day before his big job interview. And I said I hadn't known what to expect, without knowing anything more than Jess was scared. 

AITA for how I handled this, trying to take things into my own hands even though it freaked out my boyfriend at a bad time?"
"AITA for telling my ex wife to kick rocks, blow bubbles, pound sand, etc? | My ex and I have three boys - 7, 10 and 13. We've been divorced for a few years and have joint custody. Our kids have pretty much the same routine and schedule at both of our places except one thing.

She asked me to have our kids make their beds in the morning at my house because she makes them do the same at hers. She has this thing about beds being made. I could not care less about a bed being made. Neither me nor my kids are slobs. I'm not spending 20 minutes getting three boys to make a fucking bed every morning. I have better things to do.My boys don't see the logic in it. They told their mom that I don't make them make their bed so she asked that I do to help with consistency. This is her quirk, not mine."
"AITA for telling my Girlfriends daughter, that her dad kinda sucks because he and his new family went to Disneyland without her? | I’m currently in a relationship with my Gf of 4 years, and she has a daughter (we’ll call Susie) who is 7 years old, who we share with her Dad every other week. Recently we found out through the new Gf of the dad (through social media, mutual friend who makes shirts) that they had “Family shirts” done for a Disneyland trip. So we ask Susie, “why didn’t you tell us you were going to Disneyland?” out of genuine curiosity. And she looks at us confused has no idea what we’re talking about. 

Fast forward a month or so, we pick up Susie from school on the beginning of our week, and she’s going on about how much fun she had at her Grandmas house. During a school week. We then found out that the Dad, new GF, and 2 sons, had gone off on a Disneyland trip with out his ACTUAL daughter, during the school week, and couldn’t even let us have her a day early, (but that’s not that important). The 2 sons, are from the new GFs previous relationships, no way related to the Dad. We ask Susie why didn’t they take her too. And she says because then it would be an odd number and not everyone can go on the ride at the same time (or some bull crap excuse like that). 

Sometime during our week we’re in the car talking about this situation amongst my GF and I. Then Susie shouts, “they said they’re going to bring me back a gift to make up for it, and they’re going to take me next time”. I then say, “whether they bring you a gift or not, they still both suck for not taking you”. So then when she goes back on her week, she ends up telling her dad what I said, and honestly. I didn’t give a shit because I meant it. This if screwed up in my book, how do you exclude a little girl from a trip to Freaking DISNEYLAND. 

Next time we meet to exchange Susie, the dad walks up to my window and says I better keep my F****** mouth shut and stop telling my daughter bad things about him, and threatens me, and on and on. Granted, this is the first time I’ve ever said anything about the dad, because drama isn’t my thing. So I get out of the car, (because I ain’t no bitch and am size-ably larger than him, just in case if had to hold my own ground, ididnt want to have to defend myself from the seat of my car) and just explained I wasn’t lying, and asked him man to man, in front of his daughter and my Gf, “Why couldn’t Susie go with you guys to Disneyland?” He had a couple of excuses. That it was his new GFs sons first time going, and they wanted it to be about them, not that my GFs daughter couldn’t go, but because she wouldn’t have enjoyed it as much as someone who hasn’t been there before. He then also said, because she had already been there with us that she didn’t need to go this time (we had taken my GFs daughter to Disney land, the 3 of us, about 2 years ago). He then keeps going back to how he never talks bad about me (even though they do) and that he’s a good dad and that he doesn’t suck. The exchange never escalated past some mild shouting, and both parties left. 

My GF is annoyed that the situation didn’t need to happen, but does agree what the Dad and New GF did wasn’t okay. So, AITA for being honest in front of the daughter and saying her dad and “step mom” sucked. 

TLDR: Child gets excluded from Disney land family trip (Dad, Step mom, and step moms sons go, but not his biological daughter) I tell her that her Dad and Step mom suck. Dad attempts to confront me in person, but then put him on the spotlight in front of daughter, and explains that they have another trip planned for her in the future. Also says since we’ve already taken her to Disneyland, it’s okay she misses this trip. Dad claims I’m manipulating daughter, but have never said anything about Dad before. Gf gets annoyed, but agrees with me. "
"WIBTA for asking guests to take and print pictures at my wedding instead of a proper photographer? | Short background: getting married next autumn, paying for everything ourselves, having a smallish wedding (40 something people (including kids) on guest list and not sent out invites yet) to appease our families and we're going cheap as possible because we have other places we need to spend money.

We're planning on having everything in one venue and during the ceremony the guests will already be sat down in the same places they'll be sat when we eat, in tables of 8.

My fiance and I are thinking of putting some photo printers on the tables, the kind you can link to via wifi with a smartphone. We'd load it up with photo paper plus more next to the printer, they could take a photo, press ""send to printer"" and it comes out on the printer on their table. We'd need 4 or 5 to have one printer per table, but we already own 2 (we each have one) and can access 2 more for free. Any that we like we can ask for them to print an extra. At the end of the day, we agree that photos aren't that important, it's not like the wedding never happened if we don't have pictures, and the only piece of paper we're determined to retain from that day is the marriage certificate.

I mentioned the plan, which is not set in stone yet, to our mums. They hated it immediately and want us to hire an actual photographer, and says that our guests are there as guests, not employees. I think they might have a point but they are also pushing back against any non traditional aspects of the wedding, so is this them rallying against non traditional aspects of the wedding or me being a bride-zilla by expecting my guests to replace a professional photographer.

AITA?"
"AITA for not telling my husband I accidentally killed his cat? | Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

My husband has... or, had a cat which he adopted several years before we got together. We've since gotten a couple more, but he always considered that one to be his original fur-child. I loved her too, which is why it guts me to share what happened last week as I was returning home from work one night.

&#x200B;

The cat is a full black cat, and she roamed around outside often - something that I always didn't like and made me nervous, since we live in a fairly busy area where there are a lot of cars going by. It was dark when I was driving home, it was night by the time I got off work and as I was coming down the street she darted across the road just outside our house, I didn't see her in time and... you already know what happened.

&#x200B;

I felt absolutely horrible and I immediately parked the car in the driveway and broke down in tears. I couldn't even look at the cat without wanting to vomit - she was definitely dead - so I went inside, and my husband was also out at work so I was desperately trying to calm down and figure out how I was going to tell him. A couple hours later I'd calmed down a bit and was trying to draft up something to say, when my husband storms inside and starts yelling and swearing, going on about how some fucker ran down the cat, saying he was gonna be the shit out of whoever did it, etc. I understand he was just angry and really upset - normally he's the calmest person I've ever met - but at that moment his rage completely shocked me and I just sort of froze up, and I didn't have the heart to tell him I'd been the one to kill his precious cat, even by accident. I was worried he'd turn that anger on me, so I just let him think it was some random person and grieved along with him when we got her out of the street and buried her in the backyard.

&#x200B;

That was about a week ago and the guilt has me eating me alive, but I feel like saying something now after all this time would be even worse than admitting what I'd done right from the beginning. So, AITA for not telling the truth to my husband about his cat?"
"AITA for wanting to take back agreeing to an open phone policy? | My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost a year and we’ve lived together for half. The open phone policy isn’t something that either of us demanded, it just came up one time when she noticed that I don’t have a password on my phone. I answered that its annoying to put in a password every time I use my phone and there’s nothing in there that I don’t want anyone to know anyway - I don’t have nudes, I don’t gossip, I don’t save passwords or financial information. I said she can use my phone anytime. She gave me her password and said I can do the same. 

We don’t really go through each other’s phones just because we can. Sometimes if I’m in the shower she’ll tell me that I got a message from someone who is asking about something, or if either of us went on a trip without the other, we might look at the photos. It’s usually things like that.

However, the situation is a bit different now because one of my closest friends (I’ll call her Julia) confided a very personal problem to me. I’ve been friends with Julia for a long time and she’s been there for me through a lot of my downs so obviously I want to be there for her now that she’s the one who needs my support. Julia and my girlfriend know about each other but haven’t met in person because Julia lives in a different city. I didn’t tell my girlfriend about Julia’s problem, but I realized that since the problem is on-going, there’s a chance that my girlfriend might see a message from Julia about it. 

I told my girlfriend that Julia is going through a difficult time and confiding personal matters to me so I will be hiding/password protecting our chats. My girlfriend got angry and said that we agreed to an open phone policy so I should honor that and we are a couple so we shouldn’t hide things from each other. She said I’m making her feel like she’s untrustworthy and that I don’t believe she will keep Julia’s problem to herself if she gets to read about it. I said it’s not about me hiding things from her and not trusting her, it’s about me keeping the things Julia said to myself because I am the only person Julia trusted to share those to. 

So AITA?"
"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to keep her child's car seat in my car? | I just started dating a woman with a 4 year old child. Last night I went to her house to spend the night after the child was asleep. In the morning, we went to get breakfast and ofc the child had to come, which was fine. I offered to drive so we loaded him into my car. I ended up dropping them off, and forgot to get the car seat out until I got home. I texted her asking if she needed it back today, to which she replied ""I don't need it back I have another one in my car.""

Now, maybe this is shallow but I am still kinda young (24) and don't necessarily want to be advertising to the world and my friends that I am a step-dad (I'm not.) Also I think in general it's just a bit early for all of that and frankly it threw me off that I was becoming involved with the child so early. I'm not turned off to the fact that she has a son, and I really really like this girl. She seemed kind of offended when I requested for her to take it back."
"AITA for spending money on a friend and making her BF jealous? | I've been friends with this girl for about 3 years now and I've sort of taken her under my wing as she's very introverted. I have a problem where I'm very generous with my money and constantly lend it to people or buy them drinks/meals when we're out; a lot of people have taken advantage of this. I've always justified it by the fact that I earn a lot and just want people to have fun when we're out. Over the years however I've started to have some self respect and know when people are taking the piss. 

When I've been out I've always done round with this girl or she'll offer to get me a drink when she's up, so in my eyes she's good people. I'll always buy a few extra rounds when we're out or pay for dinner if we're doing something alone. No ulterior motive, as I said I just want people to have a good time and not have to worry about their finances. 

She recently started dating some guy who took an instant dislike as we're close and has seen me as sort of a rival. I'm just happy for her so I put up with her jibes and even offered on getting him a few rounds when we're out, but he always insist on buying me a round or saying no so I let it slide. 

A few weeks ago her bag was stolen and she lost her Nintendo switch. Her birthday was coming up so I bought her a new one with her two favourite games and handed them over at the small party we had. Her BF was not happy and stormed out of the room and confronted me when I was in the loo. Apparently I'm trying to buy her love or undermine him, I apologised and said he was wrong and left it at that?

AITA here? I've got the cash to spare and don't want anything back. I'm not interested in her at all and I just like seeing my friends happy."
"AITA for buying a chocolate bar for everyone in my office except the guy that had already bought one? | I work in an office of 16 people. One of my coworkers, Abby, brought in chocolate bars that she’s selling for $1 apiece as a fundraiser for her kid’s school. She first approached me and two other coworkers that sit in my desk clump, Dave and Jeff. Dave bought a chocolate bar, Jeff did not and told her that it was because our boss wouldn’t want her selling them in the office (accurate). Abby looked very disheartened when Jeff said that, so I said, “Tell you what, let me get one for everyone before the boss notices.” I bought 13 chocolate bars, one for everyone minus Abby and Dave and our boss (who I’m certain would not want one).

Dave then started huffing at me because I didn’t offer to buy him a second chocolate bar or to reimburse him for the one he had just bought. I thought he was joking around about it, but it’s been a few hours now and he’s still being snide with me about it. Jeff says that it’s just a dollar and I shouldn’t have excluded him, but I feel like this is ridiculous.

Is there some basic principle of etiquette here that I failed to observe?  


tl;dr: I bought a chocolate bar for everyone in my office except a coworker that had just bought his own, and now he's mad at me."
"AITA for telling my son he cant open his BDay presents | Today is my son's 4th birthday. Monday and Tuesday his daycare had to call me because he was misbehaving. In the past we have had some problems and I have done the same thing as always (taking away toys, time out, and writing the alphabet). This morning he woke up and I was very cheerful happy birthday... Etc. However, I did tell him if I get a call from the school that he isn't behaving he won't be allowed to open his presents today. I told my mother this plan and she though I was in the wrong that he's four and deserves to celebrate his birthday fully anyway. Additionally we brought in cup cakes but I told his teacher not to give him any if he wasn't behaving. I'm trying to raise a kid that won't be an a**hole... "
"WIBTA if I bought a purebred puppy from a reputable breeder instead of adopting from a shelter? | So I’ve been wanting to get my own dog for a while now. I want a dog that will be just my dog, not a family dog so I can take it with me when I move out of my parents house after finishing college. I’m 20, have volunteered hundreds of hours at animals shelters and have worked with dogs since I was 16. I’ve also grown up with dogs my entire life. I want to buy a purebred, AKC registered pup as my first dog. I want that because there’s a specific breed that is well suited to my life style. I also want to know the dog’s entire history, and can be present in my dog’s life from the very beginning. 

My family has frequently mentioned that I’m selfish for buying a dog instead of adopting. They say I’m encouraging puppy mills (which isn’t where I’m getting the dog from). They tell our currents dogs that I’m “shopping for a shiny new replacement dog”. It’s starting to get to me so I’m just curious if this makes me an asshole. I fully understand that there’s tons of dogs that need a home, but for my first dog I want to eliminate as many unknown factors as possible. When I feel more equipped to handle a shelter dog with many gaps in their history, then of course I would adopt a dog.

"AITA for being annoyed by / complaining about an Apple Store employee send-off ceremony during my wait? | I was at the Apple Store yesterday for a repair.  I tried to use a local business to get my issue resolved but only Apple is able to repair home button issues of the kind I had.  

I arrived 15 minutes early, figuring that if I'm early maybe the appointment would start on time, but was told to come back at the time of my appointment.  Fair enough.  I came at the time of my appointment and then they sent me off to a table to wait.  About 20 minutes into the wait, every employee in the store stopped what they were doing.  At my table this meant one employee who was assisting someone with setting up their iCloud and another employee who was activating a phone.  

Every employee then spent 5 minutes loudly, raucously applauding as one employee walked out the door for the last time because she was moving away.  It took 5 minutes because she was hugging everyone.  I heard employees later remark that they do it this way to make it intentionally embarrassing.

Eventually they all got back to work and then about 5 minutes later someone came to help me.  The help was great and itself only took 5 minutes.

I tried to appreciate the heartfelt send-off but instead my mind just returned to the fact that I'd been waiting at a table twiddling my thumbs and every customer in the store had their experience interrupted.  

Afterwards I filled out my ""how'd we do"" survey and gave my helper a perfect rating but the overall experience a low rating and explicitly complained about the wait during the ceremony.

It was only 5 minutes out of the 20+ minutes I was made to wait but it's what I focused on and what continues to annoy me when I think about it.

AITA?"
"AITA for saying I didn't want my son to have autism? | I was chatting to my mate at work yesterday about autism and how he was diagnosed in his mid-twenties with it, as I was surprised he was on the spectrum as he seems completely normal. As we was chatting I mentioned that when my son was about 1.5 years old I was worried that he might have had autism. My mate suddenly got a bit defensive and started asking ""why would I be worried?"" etc. I think I upset him by saying I didn't want my kid to have autism - surely every parent is the same? I didnt WANT my child to have it but it wouldn't have changed how I felt about him. AITA for saying this?

Edit: just to clarify, a lot of redditors I feel are projecting their own feelings and frustrations in this thread. I never said I ""wanted my son to be normal"", or even ""didn't want my son to be autistic"", I merely said:

""There was a point in time I was worried my son was autistic"".

Please do not take what I actually said, and change it to what has been said to you/what you think I said."
"AITA for suggesting a recently deceased young woman may have perished in a sarlacc pit? | A young woman I did not know personally recently died unexpectedly. While at work I overheard a group of old biddies speculating about the possible cause. They were not nice guesses; drugs, \[something else you can't say in this sub\], etc. This young lady happened to have a name somewhat similar to to Boba Fett, so i threw out the suggestion that maybe she fell into a sarlacc pit. Partly as a joke, but mostly to make a point that maybe they should stop with the gossip. Now around the office I am the guy who makes fun of dead people. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit :  Just to be clear nobody in the above situation knew her, it was a news story."
"AITA for telling my coworker to chill with the midlife crisis stuff? | I work in a job in tech where I've also made some good friends. There's me and one other girl, and six guys in our friend group. We are all between the ages of 22 and 27, all unmarried, without kids.

We like to go out clubbing, go hiking and camping, do athletic stuff. Staying out late on the weekends, and sometimes taking weekend trips to other cities. 

Now, we've got a coworker who's in his late forties, he's got a wife and 3 kids, a suburban house. And for years he was chill and easy to get along with. But he's started to act different this year.

He's always fighting with his wife and talking about it at work. Like nobody wants to hear that. He's also become weirdly borderline flirty with the other girl I work with.

But the weirdest thing... He's often wanting to go out with my friends and I.

We said sure to some casual stuff like grabbing a beer after work. 

But then, some stuff that was more uncomfortable came up.

He wanted to go clubbing with us, which just came off weird, he's twice our age, in a struggling marriage he always complains about but doesn't leave... And now he wants to go clubbing? 

Then, we were planning a weekend cabin camping trip, and he wanted to come. One of my friends said ""Won't your wife be upset she'd be with the kids all weekend?"" And he basically was like ""I don't care, I'm doing something for me once in my life."" 

The whole thing made us pretty uncomfortable and we ended up giving a white lie that we already had the maximum number of people the campground allows.

This went on for a while longer, we were making excuses.

And it honestly made me uncomfortable, it felt like a grown man with a family and responsibilities was trying to use my friends and I as a way to escape that. And potentially be disloyal to his wife, who's very nice. Plus my friend who he's been borderline flirty with doesn't wanna go to anything after work that he'll be at.

So, last Friday when he asked me what was going on over the weekend, and I said ""just some spring cleaning. It'll be relaxing!"" and he said ""Really? No plans at all? What happened to everyone going out every weekend! You're too young to be excited about chores!""

I kind of snapped at him and went ""look man, You've got a wife and three kids, I don't think that what you need right now is to be going out partying every chance you get. And we're honestly not comfortable enabling that kind of shit, knowing that your wife won't be ok about it and you're choosing to do it anyway. You seriously need to chill with the midlife crisis stuff.""

So he was mad, saying I don't know anything about his life or his marriage (false, he won't shut up about it) and that it was condescending of me to try to tell him what's best for him.

I was like ""ok whatever"" and didn't want to continue arguing.

He hasn't asked again about plans but he's been downright frosty to me since

AITA for what I said?"
"AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to smoke weed? | My girlfriend and I have been together for about 5 months now. She talked to me about she used to smoke a lot of weed but now doesn’t because she doesn’t like it anymore. However, the past week she started to smoke again and has smoked 5 times this week. I for one am NOT anti-weed. All my roomates smoke and all my friends smoke. I have no problem with it. I myself do not smoke because I tend to have bad experiences. I expressed to her how I felt about her smoking. I told her I found it unflattering and that she wasn’t her self when she was high. She wasn’t the person I have came to love when she is high. She felt as if the only reason I don’t want her smoking is because I don’t which I understand, but is not the reason. 

I don’t want to be controlling which is why I didn’t say she couldn’t smoke, rather just told her I don’t like when she does. She found it as if I was coming at her and not wanting to do something she enjoys. 

Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for getting my boyfriend nicer gift than my sister | 

So my(20M) boyfriend(19M) and my sister(21F) have birthday on same day. I built my boyfriend gaming pc so it was quite expensive, I’m also kinda poor so I’ve been saving up for it for a while.I couldn’t afford to get my sister an expensive gift, so I got her a necklace($10) and some of her favorite snacks(around $10). I could tell that she wasn’t that impressed with it but she still said thank you. 

Then she asked my boyfriend what he got from me, he said it and my sister immediately got upset, she didn’t say anything tho. After few hours she texted me and told me that she was upset and disappointed, she said that she didn’t except to come after my boyfriend who I’ve only known for 2 years and she basically said that she’s more important than him and I should’ve spent more money on her gift."
"AITA for not putting myself aside for one time? | I have a friend who is so insecure that she can't do anything by herself. Usually, when she wants to go somewhere, she just sits at home and ends up hesitating for so long that she can't go anymore. If she isn't extensively pushed to do things, she wont do anything out of her own insecurity. I have been friends with this person for about 6 years, and have always been the one to help her do things she wants to do. Every year, I organise a surprise party for her birthday to make sure she won't doubt there are people that love her. I often buy her things she likes but is too hesitant to buy herself, and I'm always there to give her advice when she starts hesitating.

Now, I'm unable to be there for her 24/7; my parents beat me when I was younger, so I have a bunch of baggage of my own that I need to take care of, I haven't recovered from that yet, as stupid as it sounds. I also work a heavy job and have a SO I need to spend time with.

It was a lot easier to take care of my friend back in high school. My parents neglected me and I had very few to no friends other than her, so it was easier to also neglect myself so I could be there all the time to make her feel better. However, now that I'm an adult and starting to have my own things to take care of, it gets way harder. Its not that I don't want to do it, its just physically impossible.

Regardless, due to me always having been the one to take care of her, people naturally see me as her caretaker. I'm expected to do everything for her. If I fail to do any of these things, people will look down on me for being a bad friend and her mother will accuse me of abandoning her, which she has done multiple times.

A friend of hers has approached me recently, wanting to celebrate her birthday ten months in advance by taking her on a trip to Japan, something she always wanted and has the funds for, but as usual, is too insecure and hesitant to actually go. I'm expected to drop everything and organise a trip to the other side of the world that I can only dream of, for her, only two months after the last surprise party I've organised for her. The friend that wants to take her there has been messaging me every day to ask about my progress, from the money I'm putting in, to the place she's going to stay at, to what she's gonna do when they're there.

My own birthday is tomorrow. I forgot about it completely because I was only busy with hers for the past week and remembered only when my SO reminded me that I had a birthday coming up. Now I feel guilty that I kind of want to celebrate it when I should be working on my friend's trip. The friend that wants to take her to Japan has reacted very passive aggressively to me saying I'm kind of busy at the moment and not able to be on Discord with her for whole days for the organising. I'm pretty sure my friend's mother is also once again going to say I abandoned her.

EDIT: Thank you for the early birthday wishes. I cried a little.
EDIT2: Thank you too for the huge wake up slap. I'll do my best."
"AITA for immediately bailing on plans when I saw my friend’s boyfriend there? | This just happened a couple hours ago. My friend and I had a day planned to go shopping and grab some lunch. She picked me up and when I got to her car I saw her boyfriend sitting there as well. I was kinda taken aback because she mentioned nothing about him joining us. I said something like “ohh uhh you know what I’m actually just gonna stay home today sorry see you later” and turned back around to go home. 


This isn’t the first time she’s done this, where she didn’t mention she’s invited other people to an event or gathering or whatever. And while her boyfriend is cool, they are quite affectionate towards each other in public and I just didn’t wanna be third-wheeling when I thought it was gonna be a girls day, ya know? 


I haven’t talked to her since and don’t know if I could’ve handled the situation better. 
AITA for bailing like that?

"AITA for refusing to pay alimony to my cheating ex-wife | I met my wife in my early 30s. She was in her mid 20s at the time. I was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. She on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage. 

So when I meet her we click instantly and I fall head over heels for her. We get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. When we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. Obviously I was jealous but I went along with it since it seemed logical.

So she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while I work 12 hour days and then some. I’m not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style.

A couple years ago I discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend’s husband. Divorced obviously followed.

The only major asset we had in the US was our house, which was a premarital asset. We had a shared bank account, but since I am a finance guy I handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country. 

Now if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, I’d have no problem paying what’s fair. But the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent. 

So in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, >90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay.

So here I am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. So I sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it’s taking so long to liquidate our savings. Once abroad I immediately stop alimony payments.

Now she has no legal recourse (I’ve double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states.

The reason I’m asking here is that my own children are split on this. My son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side. I figured it would be interesting to see the opinions of people here."
"AITA For saying my sister degree is a hand out and she shouldn't be so conceited. | So my older sister is a medical doctor and I am really proud of her. My parents wanted me to go into that however it is a very competitive area, my A Levels did not stack up and UKCAT (UKCAT is like an IQ test of some sorts that tests your problem solving) was not good enough. Universities did not want me. Fair enough that was in the past, I've gotten over it.

The reason my older sister got into med school was purely because she got invited into a programme that allows you to get into a certain med school at lower grade boundaries and they ignore the UKCAT results. My A Levels were better than hers and my UKCAT were also better. She only got into that med school and nowhere else.

So my younger sister is going through the same process now, doing her A Levels and UKCAT and she also asks me for advice for her personal statement and I give her ideas. My older sister shoots me down and said that only her opinion counts as she is the only one who got into med school. (It was 10 years since she last applied to med school so I think I can say that some of the points may have changed since then).

What I also noticed is that she says some really offhanded comments like ""This is what you get for messing about. A shit prospect."" Or talk about other people degrees like ""This is what a 2:2 degree gets you, a dead-end job.""

Thing is she didn't get a first, only a 2:1 in her degree I think and that she always say this kind of shit. I just straight up told her ""I don't care if you were the only one who got into med school as you only got in because of an hand out and it does not count.""

I am not saying her hard work is for nothing during her medical degree and when she also became a doctor, i'm proud of her for accomplishing that however she has no right to say that about anyone else.

She is angry at me and rightfully so as I called her degree a hand out but she doesn't have the right to dismiss what people are saying or to say shit about people just because their life strayed a bit.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: People are saying that I am just jealous. I am not, I am happy for her. I wouldn't have said that at all if she didn't keep on belittling everyone who isn't a doctor. She says offhand comments about close family members. Singles me out and calls me an idiot. If you think no one would snap after such belittlement, then you guys are just push overs.

Also I was calling her admission into med school a hand out. That is what I meant. Because ultimately it is what it is. She got into that position because of circumstances. If she didn't have those circumstances, they would have instantly rejected her. People have parents divorced just to get accepted into that programme. Her staying in med school and graduating which took a lot of hard work and time. I am proud of her for that. 

She is my sister and I love her however I just can't stand this constant belittlement."
"AITA: My SO refused to babysit my son after I babysat his. | My partner and I have been together for 5 years.  We each have sons from previous marriages. His is 6 and mine is 8.  I have primary custody of my son.  His ex has primary custody, but he has a lot of parenting time on school breaks.  My son has severe ADHD and is a difficult to parent.  His son is a typical kid, but he often doesn't follow directions and talks back a lot.  

A couple weeks ago I pulled my son out of his school because they refused to grant him needed services. I enrolled him in a better school for him, but he was out of school for a week during the transition.  This happened to coincide with my SO's son's spring break, which he spends with us.  There were no daycamps available and my SO had little vacation time, so I offered to bring both boys to school for the week.  This is totally acceptable at my job.  I work for a small business, and every employee has kids that they bring in when needed. 

It was a hellish week.  My son was struggling more than usual due to the transition.  His son was really wild and refused to listen when I tried to get him to calm down.  He did stay home with him for 2 days, but I took him to work for 3. I had my son for all 5 days.  I didn't ask him to watch my son on the days he was off because I knew he was struggling with his behavior.  

After the week ended, I was spent.  I told him I'd scheduled a meeting with a support group the following weekend, so he'd have to watch the kids for 2 and a half hours the following weekend.  He refused.  He didn't just refuse, he said I was unreasonable for asking because he had told me he didn't want to be responsible for my son.  That true.  He did say that the previous weekend.  But after he said it, he also watched my son while I went grocery shopping with no complaint. I thought he was telling me that he didn't want to be his child care, not that he wouldn't watch him for a couple hours every now and then. I never would have agreed to be his spring break child care had I known it was a one way street.  I feel very used. 

I told my SO that I'm no longer willing to babysit his son.  He goes into work early, so whenever his son is here, he relies on me to get him to daycare in the morning.  I don't care.  He can figure it out.  AITA?"
"AITA for basically stealing from an eBay seller? | I am a collector of old video game consoles. I decided to buy a GameCube but I specifically wanted to use the GameBoy Player accessory.

There are two parts to this. There is the hardware attachment itself that connects to the bottom of the GameCube, and then there is the startup disc required to use it that goes into the GameCube itself.

I was looking around on eBay for a bit and then I found what I was looking for. There was a GameCube for sale that came with a controller, a memory card, and the GameCube player. I wanted to be sure that it included the startup disc and saw that it did. In all caps, it said ""WITH STARTUP DISC!!!"" (note the three exclamation points for emphasis). This posting was unambiguously stating that the startup disc was included. I saw the disc mentioned again in the product details list of components.

I bought the system. When it arrived, I couldn't find the startup disc. I figured maybe the seller forgot to pack it. I emailed the seller and wrote the following:

""I received the GameCube. Everything seems to be fine except it is missing the startup disc. Please send that to me ASAP and I will be sure to still leave positive feedback.""

The next day, I got the following reply:

""I'm not sure how you got the impression that this included a disc. Everything for sale was shown in the pictures.""

I was furious when I read that. I messaged him back and attached a screenshot of the item description along with the following message:

""I got that impression because YOU FUCKING WROTE IT! You even added three exclamation points to make damn sure buyers knew it. Send me the fucking disc already.""

He responded and explained that he had just copied and pasted the item description from somewhere else and didn't read it first. Ebay terms of service actually expressly prohibit sellers from doing that precisely to prevent this sort of situation, but I'm guessing he didn't read that either. He didn't actually have a disc to sell.

Returning it seemed like a hassle, so I proposed a solution. I told the seller that $75 seems to be the going rate for these discs. I said that if he would just give me a partial refund for $75 to avoid dealing with the shipping, we could resolve this amicably.

He had to audacity to reply that $75 was too much and he would only offer me $40.

I reported him for violation of eBay terms of service, and then initiated a chargeback through my bank. 

I decided that I was going to keep the GameCube because fuck that guy. If eBay insisted that I had to send it back, I planned to send it back broken and claim I got it that way.

I actually never heard from eBay about this, and this was over 90 days ago, so I doubt I will. Maybe the seller didn't report anything to eBay because he knows he violated the seller agreement.

A co-worker who I discuss gaming with said I took things too far and technically stole from the seller. I can see his point, but at the same time, that seller is a piece of shit.

So Reddit, AITA?"
"AITA- And to add insult to injury your husband ate my very last snickers ice cream bar, assholes. | 

AITA- I’ve been really sick lately. I’ve been to hospital after hospital getting scan after scan. I’ve been beyond depressed so my husband decided to take me on an overnight trip to the beach so we could go to my favorite haunted house. To do that, we needed a dog sitter. MIL enters stage right, but I am thankful. 

My husband didn’t tell me that she would be doing laundry while spending the night ( which I have zero problems with). I, not knowing, left my laundry in the dryer to be folded upon return. That is my fault and I totally acknowledge that. 

We get home and she’s been cooking soup on the stove for three hours and had left a mess. The house was hot. We came home early because I got too sick to stay so I started feeling aggravated seeing the kitchen messy and the house at 85 degrees. I go upstairs to set some things down and notice she has folded all of my laundry- including my unmentionables. Sorry male redditors for the next part. Part of my illness causes severe bleeding. So some unmentionable items are too embarrassing to be seen. I get she was “trying to help” but I’m furious at this point. Lasers shooting out of my eyes mad. She’s still here. I hold it in. She did us a favor.

MIL exit stage left. I clean the kitchen. I go to run the disposal because of all the food in the sink from cleaning the pots. It gurgles metal murder. She’s left plastic in the disposal. It’s now broken. 

I go to sooth my anger with chocolate and ice cream goodness. Her husband ate my last snickers ice cream bar. That’s the final straw. 


I explode at my husband and start crying. I do make it clear I know he couldn’t help any of it, it’s not his fault, and reassure him I know she was trying to help. Yet, he still thinks IATA for being so upset about all of this. 

AITA?

Edit- you all have made such great points that were hard to see through  all of the anger. Thank you, Reddit family for your honesty. I could have definitely approached the situation better. MIL never even had an inkling that I was upset and I apologized to my amazing husband, who I am sure is just as tired and frustrated from what I am going through because we’re going through all of it together.  This right here is why I love Reddit."
"AITA for not sharing my drink with my new SO's friends when I was meeting them for the first time? | This happened this past Saturday. So, I (24M), have been with my SO (22F) who we'll call Cat for about a little over a month now. I've met her roommates but I have yet to meet her entire friend group which stems from a dance team she's on. She was really wanting me to meet them and I was wanting her to meet my 3 best friends from childhood who we'll call Tom, John, and Zack. My best friends and I already planned to go out drinking last Saturday night and so did my SO and her friends, so I told my SO my friends and I would meet up with her and I can meet her friends and she can meet mine. All goes well in the planning phase.

Come Saturday night, I show up to the bar with my 3 best friends and my SO starts introducing my friends and I. Everything went well and I met most in that moment except these 3 girls who were just acting very boujee and standoffish but I didn't think much of it. The bar was right next to us so I told Cat I was going to get a drink. I was standing by the bar with my friends and I ordered a $5 pitcher which is a large vodka drink in a bud light pitcher. This drink is typically shared because of it's size. As I'm standing by the bar waiting for my friends to order their drinks I hear someone yell: 

> Hey! Cat's boyfriend!

I turn around and it's the 3 girls who I did not meet. I said hey and reached out for a handshake and without saying a word to me, they held out their cups instead and pointed at my pitcher. I was honestly in disbelief for a second, as was my SO who I could see in the corner of my eye, and my 3 best friends. 

Whatever the case, I did what any gentleman would do...I grabbed their 3 cups, filled them up to the brim with my drink, and then handed one cup to Tom, the other to John, and the last one to Zack. I looked back at the girls, promptly thanked them for providing cups for my friends, kissed my SO on the forehead, and left them alone and hung out with my boys the rest of the night.

My SO is saying that it *was* fucked up what they did but that I should have just given them the drinks since it was the first time meeting them and she woulda paid the $5 back to me. I explained it wasn't money but principle and how they felt entitled to a drink and didn't even bother to shake my hand or refer to me by my name but instead as your boyfriend. She also thinks I'm TA for leaving her for the rest of the night. I can *maybe* agree with that but after that incident, I wasn't in the mood to be around that, so I chose not to.

AITA?

EDIT: RIP my inbox. Thanks ya'll for the responses. It seems by majority people think I'm NTA but I think I'm gonna personally stick with ESH for ignoring my SO for the rest of the night and just the general immaturity of my actions. Just to clarify, I did not leave her *alone alone*. I left her with her large group of friends and she was 100% safe. 

For those asking about the drink. It's one of [these pitchers](https://www.beerneonsforsale.com/product/bud-light-beer-pitcher/) with sprite, UV Blue, dash of Everclear, something else to make it sweeter, and a bunch of ice to make up the rest of the space. It's delicious. I'm not going to say where but it's in the deep South in a small college town. 

That entire situation has blown over in my personal life at this point and I haven't bothered to ask what her friends thought about me doing that. Just so we're clear, it was only those 3 that were rude, the rest were extremely nice which is why I feel like TA for ignoring them after. 

Thanks again and Happy Thanksgiving to everyone who celebrates. Hope you can spend it with family, friends, and good food!"
"AITA for taking shared things I've purchased away from my roommate when it's clear he won't use/take care of them properly? | I've been living with a roommate for a year. We've had only one talk because I feel like I shouldn't have to tell him to do these things. He's a grown ass man and I've already told him this stuff before. I'm tired of repeating myself.

He leaves empty stuff about. I bought two boxes of coffee for him, one for myself. He drank it all. I found mine empty in the cupboard. I put the box in front of the Keurig. He moved it aside for 2 weeks. I've told him recyclables have to be rinsed. 4 days ago he put an unrinsed milk jug in the recycle. I've been moving it to the sink and he just puts it back. Earlier I unscrewed the cap and put it under the faucet. I just went into the kitchen and he'd moved the faucet to rinse something else. The recycle bin is now in my room.

He doesn't replace things he uses. He'll use all of the paper towels and leave the empty roll on the holder. I started putting the pack of paper towels next to the holder. He would take a roll and just leave it on the counter. Recently, he left the cardboard tube, plastic wrap, and new roll on the counter next to the empty holder. I lined them up so he'd see them. He put the roll on the holder and moved the tube/plastic to the side for 2 days. I moved the recycle in front of the tube and plastic right where he could see it. He moved it all aside. The paper towel holder is now in my room.

He never puts my pots/pans away. I've told him to put them away if they're clean, he says okay and never does it. Recently I put some pans on the counter above the cupboard with the doors open for 3 days. It's now in my room. He magically forgot where knives go and put one in the silverware drawer instead of the knife block. I put the knife with the pans the 1st day, then moved it in front of the block the next. The knives are now in my room.

He doesn't do anything for apartment upkeep. I clean the floors, kitchen counters, dining room table, etc. I'd say I'm the only one who vacuums but we just had fleas and now he loves to do it. It took *fleas* for him to contribute. When company's over it's his bathroom they use and it's always filthy. He keeps throwing food in the sink. I've said repeatedly food goes in the garbage. I once found 5 mini wheats in there.

He doesn't consider others. Our friend has bad psoriasis and leaves lots flakes in the bathroom. It's gross, but there's nothing he can do about it. My roommate will give him shit in front of us. I had to say, ""You need to stop. He has an actual condition, he can't help it. If it's really bad, talk to him in private."" He just went, ""Uh, *okay*?"" and looked confused. Recently we had to clear the kitchen for a remodel. He says before, ""I won't be visiting my mom like I usually do, I'll be free to help."" I wake up the next day to a message saying, ""I'll help when I get home from moms"".

This *was* 14k characters, he does a lot of shit."
"AITA - for hiding my dishes from my girlfriend. | She moved in about two months ago and will seriously fill up a sink of dishes a day. She never washed them and we have no dishwasher. I told her I was going to throw them away if she didn’t clean them. Well while she was sleeping I washed all of them and took everything out to my storage unit but two cups, two mugs, two plates, two bowls, a mixing bowl, and a big past pan and a big skillet. Then I put them in storage and told her I threw them all away.

She seriously cooks like 4-5 times a day and makes a lot of messes. She is super pissed off right now but two weeks ago we got bugs waiting for her to clean them. When I complained she said “people get bugs” so since then I have been reluctantly cleaning all her dishes each night.

Btw all the dishes I bought before she moved in so they are mine.

Sadly we signed a lease together so I’d have to deal with this for ten more months. "
"AITA for changing my mind about having kids with my husband on the spectrum? | My husband (28m) and I (29f) have been married six months but together for over ten years. We always knew he had some personality quirks but a doctor confirmed a few years ago he has Asperger’s and he takes medication for anxiety.  I never wanted children growing up but changed my mind when I met my partner because I thought (and still think) he would be a good father. In addition, my family has inheritable medical conditions (schizophrenia, bipolar, depression).

Over time my husband’s behavior has become more idiosyncratic and demonstrative of spectrum behavior (lack of executive function, emotion blindness, difficulty empathizing).  We are working these issues out on our own through couple’s therapy. Honestly, they’re incredibly challenging to work through and it’s been really tough. I’m realizing that I wouldn’t want a child with my husband’s spectrum traits, much less a fully autistic child. 

We have talked before about having kids in a few years, but I’m starting to think the genetic uncertainty regarding our kids makes me not want children any more. I know my husband will be upset, but I honestly wouldn’t don’t want that future for myself. This is one of the reasons I would never adopt because you can just never control all of the variables about how the kid turns out. I don’t want to intentionally bring a child into the world that I may not be able to fully support emotionally. 

Edit RE: Adoption: my point about not being able to control the variables is because unlike a long-term partner, you don’t know the full genetic/mental history of the child’s parents. 

Clarification: My family’s mental history has also evolved more in recent years (my sister’s diagnoses and subsequent decline). This is wasn’t a factor when we first met, but is now a factor.  I didn’t want children when we first met but changed my mind based on my husband’s positive traits and his enthusiasm to be a parent.  My family history is a significant concern for both of us, but one my husband is willing to accept. 

AITA for changing my mind?"
"AITA for not Letting my Wife get a gun | Just want to say from the beginning I am not anti gun. I respect the 2nd amendment and people's rights to have them. I personally do not like them and don't like being near them.

So the backstory of this is my wife's best friend had her house broken into 2 weeks ago. They lived pretty close to us. Two guys broke in and didn't really steal anything once they realized her husband had woken up and they left almost immediately. They had already broken into the car outside and taken everything inside of it. One of the guys was carrying a large knife (Sword kinda?) that was visible as he ran off. Police still haven't found them.

This has absolutely terrified my wife and she wants to get a gun. She comes from a different background than me where guns are really common.

We have two daughters and I absolutely do not want guns in the house at all. We have an alarm system on all the windows and doors and Cameras in the kitchen, garage, and on the stairs.

She is saying that isn't enough because once they are in it is too late and won't matter that they go off if they are there to hurt us.

I put my foot down and said we aren't getting a gun and she is calling me (literally) an asshole who doesn't care for the well being of her or my daughters' lives which I think is completely untrue.

Am I the Asshole here?

EDIT: I do want to say she has known since before we were married how I felt about guns and that I would never let them in the house."
"WIBTA for reporting my roommates for academic malpractice? | Okay, so I am living with three international roommates (let's call them Trisha, Ron and Alexandra). They are all from the same country and Trisha and Alexandra are best friends since elementary school. I initially mostly got along with them but ever since we had a fight things have been sore. (Basically Trisha and Ron got together and because they started sleeping in one room, it got too hot for them. So they set the heater for very specific times such as 6-8pm, 7-9am etc. and refused to just keep it on low or extend the hours. That's fine but they would not compromise at all and we ended with me caving in and saying that I was disappointed.)

Apparently me commenting on their behaviour hurt their pride and the two have been very passive aggressive to me if not borderline aggressive. Living with them has become very stressful for me. They are at home all day and occupy the whole kitchen and leave their food in our shared pans for days but as soon as I dare leave something for more than 1 hour, Trisha immediately complains. Trisha has a bad temper so she will scream around during random hours but when I talk on the phone at 10pm (they sleep at 1am), they immediately complain. The list goes on.

I know for a fact that Trisha does not do anything all day and Alexandra, who is studying the same degree as me, has not been going to classes (she only comes to clock in) or has done anything so far. They are rich international students and all they care about is shopping, eating and themselves. I wouldn't care if they weren't so (passive) aggressive (Ron has ""accidentally"" splashed me with hot oil and they walk around with knives as if I am not there) and selfish all the time. I know Trisha has paid someone online to do all her course work and I am suspecting Alexandra is doing so as well. (By all her course work I mean everything not just one or two papers)

WIBTA for anonymously reporting Trisha?"
"AITA for checking on an ex regularly while in a diff. relationship? | I’m in a new relationship and things are going great. We haven’t been together too long. Less than 3 years. All this time though I have checked in on an ex of mine regularly. Every six months or so & just reg. stuff like how her family/work/life is and updating her on mine. 

My new partner isn’t crazy about this. But I think she needs to get that we are just friends and wouldn’t date again. I get that it makes her uncomfortable but my ex was a big part of my life and it was a fine breakup. So theres no anger or anything between us, making friendship an option. It’s not like we are chatting each day. It’s only periodically and only so I can share with her (my ex) all the updates in my life and see how she’s doing too. 

AITA for chatting with my ex? I think my current GF needs to be more secure in what we have going on and realize that if I wanted to date my ex...I would."
"WIBTA for asking my step daughter to use her ""birthday money"" to pay for the athletics she wants to participate in at school this year? | Background:
Not really my step daughter but my girlfriend's daughter. They live with me. We share finances. I share in all of parenting responsibilities with her mother, so you get the idea. 

  Last year my girlfriend and her two children moved across country and turned me into a parent. Anna (then 14f) started a brand new school for 8th grade, and fit in perfectly! She played on the volleyball team back at her old school, and wanted to play here as well. Her old school barely had enough girls to make up a team so we were a little nervous that she wouldn't make it, but she did and her mother and I were elated.
   We went to 90% of her games, her mom made matching hair bows for all of the girls, we brought them all cupcakes on Anna's birthday... etc, etc. Anna showed little motivation out on the court, and forgot her uniform/kneepads almost half of the time. Her team was really terrible, in fact the didn't win once all season, and we understood that it must have been hard to get motivated. 
   Spring sports roll around and she wants to go out for the track team... Again, mom and I take her out and buy her new running shoes, sign up to volunteer at some of the meets, etc etc. She didn't compete in a single meet for the whole season because she wasn't academically eligible (missing assignments in one of her classes was the largest contributor to this).
   We'll, now, freshman year is in full swing and she's talking about going out for the basketball team, maybe soccer, maybe track. I've already told her ""please don't sign up for any of these things if your mom and I are going to be more motivated for it than you are. It costs a lot of money to sign up for each sport AND we make special arrangements to make sure we can watch you play. Do you know how infuriating it is to rush out of work and drive 40 minutes to see that you haven't even brought the right equipment to your match?""
   Yesterday her grandfather (my gf's dad) sent her 200 dollars for her birthday. She was really excited about it. I said, ""good, you can use that money to register for some of those sports you want to do this year!"" They all thought I was kidding. But I'm not. I think it would be a valuable life lesson. Of course, if she goes all in on sports this year, I'd totally be willing to fund all of her future endeavors. 
WIBTA for enforcing this?


EDIT:  
So, her mom and I talked it over. I've read all of your comments, and it's not fair for me to punish her for not bring as committed as we were. 
We are going to pay for the registration for basketball, and also for a pair of very basic basketball shoes. If she wants nicer ones, she can pay for the ""upgrade"" with her own money. 
Also, we won't be attending all of her games. We're going to ask her to identify a few games that are important to her, and make arrangements to attend those. 
If she shows that she's committed this season, we'll up our commitment level. Until then, I think this is the best way to keep me and her mom from getting irritated with her, while still encouraging her to get out there and participate in being a teen. 
Thanks, y'all!

EDIT2:
For everyone asking if she has ADD, she doesn't. She hasn't been tested, but I my father and I and several of my cousins (no siblings) all have adult ADD. I've been getting treated for mine for about 25 years, I'm intimately familiar with it."
"AITA For getting upset with my roommate for inviting his brother over? | So, for context, I have 2 roommates. One we will call C, and one we will call F. While C and I get along just fine, I find that F and I butt heads a lot. Not that F is a bad guy, he is a clean and organized roommate, just not a great friend.

Now, C has a girlfriend named M, who has never seen Lord of the Rings in her life. In fact, she just doesn't do movies well and finds action movies dull. So C and I were both surprised when we convinced her to try Lord of the Rings the following night. 

Now, M has a bad attention span with action movies, so I figured I would play it safe. I love watching movies with people who have never seen them. It let's me re-experience the movies through a different set of eyes. And I really cherish the LoTR films so I wanted her to have the best experience possible. 

I asked F is he was planning on having anybody over that night, and when he confirmed he wasn't, I asked if he could keep it that way. I told him what we were watching, and that I didn't want too many people there to distract her from the movie. In fact, M was the only person coming over. He seemed to be a little put off, but he asked if he could watch it with us, to which I said ""of course dude, it's your apartment too"".


Well, we get M over to watch the movie and get about 30 minutes in. M is watching intently, only talking to ask questions, and genuinely enjoying it.

When we hear a knock on the door. It was F's younger brother, who we will call F2. Now, F2 was like 2 years younger than the rest of us, and is a really nice dude. F said he wanted him over to watch the movie too. So we say ""um, sure"", and F2 finds a seat.

Within 2 minutes, the brothers are now talking about their days and just random stuff in general. This goes on for a few minutes, and it wasn't exactly quiet. I noticed that M has started looking back at them, So I pause the movie, and just asked ""are you done? We're trying to watch a movie.""

This got under F's skin, and he shot back that this was his apartment too, and he didn't like being told what to do. I responded that any other night, I wouldn't care, but tonight was a special night. And I asked him to respect that, to which he said he felt disrespected anyway. So he and F2 left. 

We then watched the rest of the movie and M really enjoyed it. Asking when we could watch the 2nd one.

I just tried talking with F about it, and he responded with hostility, stating that I put too much stake in movies and should care more about people. He also said that he invited his brother because I had asked him not to, and he said I had no right, to keep him from having people over. He also included that I apparently hate his brother.

So… thoughts

EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback so far! I didn't post here to try to validate myself, but to legitimately see if I was out of line, and work on things with F moving forward. So I'll take all these thought into consideration when I talk with him again about it!"
"WIBTA if I told everyone the terrible thing my sister did? | Last night I found out that my sister (32F) stole over 40K from our grandma. She has been using her credit card for the last year, and then doctoring her billing statements. Since my grandma doesn’t use the Internet, she had no idea this was happening. I feel like I have lost my sister forever. This level of betrayal is unforgivable, and it has devastated our parents. My poor dad can’t even talk about grandma without tearing up. 

They found out over a month ago, and have been dealing with the aftermath in private since they are so embarrassed and do not want the rest of the family to find out. My dad is getting a second job to pay her back, since that was all of her savings and she had to dip into her retirement. He is busy enough as it is, and I am so angry that he has to clean up her mess yet again. My grandma is deciding whether she wants to press charges or not, and honestly I think she should. Clearly she has a problem if she thinks stealing that much from an elderly woman is ok, and she should pay for what she did. 

So my question is, WIBTA if I went against my parents wishes, and told all of our family and friends what my sister has done? I want everyone to know who she really is, so she can feel the severity of her actions. I knew she had questionable morals, but thought she was a good person. This has rocked me to my core, and I hate that our extended family is oblivious to the situation. I am thinking to go to the family Christmas party this year and tell everyone what a monster she is, but my mom has asked me not to and I want to respect her wishes. If I do tell, I would appreciate advice on how to go about it as delicately as possible.

Things aren’t always black and white, and she is still my sister and has been there for me through a lot. She was in the room for the birth of both my kids, and has been a second mother to my daughter. Doing this could ruin our relationship forever. Right now I don’t want anything to do with her, but that could change in a few years. Also, I don’t want to embarrass my parents, and I know they are going to be mortified if I do. Everyone is going to find out eventually though, and I think it is unfair to keep them in the dark and let them get her Christmas presents. 

ETA: My grandma wants to tell everyone, but is trying to respect my parent’s wishes and doesn’t want to hurt them. 

Her plan is to pay $1,000 a month, but that will take years which is why we are trying to come up with ideas to get the money back to her sooner

She spent the money on frivolous things like vacations, clothes, nice home furnishings and appliances, hotel rooms, bills, her cats, and to help pay her debt from filing for bankruptcy years ago. There was absolutely no good reason for her to steal the money. She has a full time job that pays well. 

2nd Edit: Wow, these comments are divided! I will not tell my family around Christmas time, that would be unfair to everyone. Ours is already ruined, I shouldn’t do that to anyone else. Other than that I still don’t know what I should do, so keep voting. All of the advice has made me feel less helpless, thank you everyone.

TLDR: WIBTA if I told our extended family that my sister stole 40K from my grandma, even though it would make everyone hate her and embarrass my parents?"
"AITA for being commenting on my SIL’s behavior leading up to and during my wedding? | Ok so a little background here...
My SIL is the wife of my husband’s identical twin brother.

2017: For her wedding, we got into a disagreement because she didn’t like my dress. Mind you I wasn’t in the wedding party nor actually married to my husband yet (so no formal photos of me). My dress was long and black and just the chest part was white and black. 

Her color scheme was burgundy and black, so I was trying to coordinate but avoid all black because that was her bridesmaids dress color. She then told my MIL she felt like my dress was trying to compete with the bride. (The bigger issue was that she was 7 months pregnant so anyone in a form fitting gown could potentially upstage her.) My MIL told her it didn’t and then she herself ended up getting a white and black dress. (Read: not happy SIL)

2019: Flash forward to my wedding. My color scheme was shades of cream, gold, and a splash of hunter green. My bridesmaids wore a very light champagne. 

My SIL picked out a dress months before that was all black. She showed me pictures online and then when it came in the mail. I told her it looked great. 

Then a month before my wedding she decides to dye her blonde hair bright pink and purple. Felt like an attention grab, but I tried to let it go. 

Two weeks before the wedding she asked if she could wear hunter green heels, and I said that would look cute. 

Day of the wedding, she’s wearing a light champagne glittery gown. Basically the in between my bridesmaids dress color and mine. 

She posted pictures on FB of her and my BIL and people started congratulating her because they thought she got married! I was a little annoyed and felt like it was deceitful since she showed me a black gown. 

We ended up discussing it and I just mentioned people were probably confused because her dress looked bridal. She pretended to be shocked and said she was just trying to fit my theme. 

Pictures arrived, and now I’m annoyed because in all the pictures of everyone walking down the aisle she’s either on her phone, or talking to the person in front of her. Laughing and fully not looking at the ceremony. For reference, she sat in the aisle seat next to the aisle where we were walking down. 

So am I the asshole for being annoyed/frustrated?

"WIBTA for asking adults to pay for themselves at my daughter's birthday party? (TIME SENSITIVE) | My daughter was born in December. She has always been envious of kids who get to have summer beach/pool parties. This year, I decided that I was going to make her wish come true. I found a swim school with an indoor pool that hosts birthday parties. The package for up to 20 kids in the pool was $475. (Or so I thought) I added six pizzas to that, so we are at $535. Add a cake, party favors, decorations, etc., and I'm looking at around $700 for this party.

Yesterday, while I was setting up the specifics of the party with the coordinator, she mentioned (now, three days before the party) that the 20 ""kids"" included in the pool actually applies to everyone in the pool, not just kids. She said that if any adults go swimming at the party - over that 20 person limit that I paid for, there will be a charge of $10 per person over the 20 people. We have 19 kids coming - I came in just under the 20 people. So now, if ten adults decide they are going to swim with their kids, that's $100 out of my pocket in addition to the $700 I am already spending.

I didn't sign up for that. This party is for the kids. I don't mind paying if aunt/uncle/grandparent of my daughter wants to swim, but am I expected to foot the bill for any random parent that decides they want to take a dip?

I want to send out a notice to all parents that responded to my Evite that with some party notes.  (like ""wear comfortable clothes, it will be 90 degrees in the pool area"") Listed among those notes will be something like: ""The swim school has notified me that adults may swim with their children for an additional cost of $10 per guest."" I'm not trying to sound cheap here, but AITA if I don't want to pay extra for adults to swim at my daughters birthday party?

My family is divided. Some think I should suck it up and pay for whoever wants to swim. Some think this party is for the kids, and adults are on their own - I should send a polite note. My dad says I should print out a sign and hang it on a wall somewhere that says explains that they need to pay for themselves.

I haven't sent the note out yet. I want to gauge the reaction I get here before I do anything.

WIBTA??

&#x200B;

Edit: Here is the note I am thinking of sending:

&#x200B;

Hi All,

Just a few notes regarding \[Daughter's Name\] Birthday party this \[Date\].

1. The room housing the pool is kept at a temperate of 90 degrees. Dress appropriately so you won't be too warm.

2. Life vests, rafts, pool noodles, paddle boards, etc. are all provided.

3. There will be a lifeguard on staff during the entirety of the party.

4. The pool depth is four feet all the way around.

5. Children under three years old must be accompanied by an adult.

6. The Swim School has informed me that adults are welcome to swim as well, for a charge of $10 per adult. You can pay at the front desk when you arrive if you choose to swim with your child. They will not allow more than 30 people in the pool at any one time.

&#x200B;

Edit: I was right, the flyer DOES only mention children. It says nothing about charging extra for adults.

"AITA for asking my dad why he doesn't parent my little bro the same way he parented me and my older brother? | Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I'm on mobile and this is my first ever post so please be kind. This probably isn't that interesting but I need an outside view. TL:DR at the end.

So my parents have three kids: K (M, 24), Me (F, 22) and B (M, 15). There's a 7 year age gap between me and B so needless to say he came out of nowhere, but we all love him. Growing up, K and I were parented pretty much the same: bedtime at 9pm, no harsh swearing, don't go too far from the house, etc. At first, B was also parented like this, but because K and I grew up and needed less parenting (could stay up til whenever, could go anywhere as long as we're safe, etc.), they started being less strict about the rules with B.

Now, the staying up past 9 and going wherever as long as he's safe is fine, fair enough, that doesn't bother me. The problem I have is with the swearing rule. Now I say rule, but we didn't have any spoken ""you must/must not do this"" type rules, they were unspoken and we followed them because we feared the wrath of mother. This particular swearing rule was that you weren't really allowed to swear, but we could as long as it was only in front of our parents, not too often, and not too harshly (for example fuck and shit were fine occasionally, but bastard and cunt were never allowed).

K and I followed this rule, and if we didn't we got punished. But if B doesn't follow the rule it's completely brushed over, and it might sound really petty but I'm kind of annoyed about it because he swears all the time, and he's only 15. It wouldn't even bother me as much if he didn't get away with what we were screamed at for at his age. Hell, I haven't even got the courage to say cunt in front of my parents now at age 22.

So, to the point of this post. My dad, B and I were all sat together and B was talking about something, and amidst his usual swearing he throws in cunt, and again my dad didn't even seem to notice. So I asked my dad why he doesn't say anything to B about swearing so harshly when K and I got screamed at/grounded, etc. His response was something along the lines of ""What do you want me to do about it? We've tried telling him off for it and he still does it, do you want us to scream at him? He's exposed to it everywhere so what do you want us to do?"". Now what I really wanted to say was ""Why don't you try parenting your child?"" but what I actually said was ""Me and K got screamed at for it, why doesn't he? It's one thing to be exposed to it, it's another to do it"". All he said was ""Okay, OP"" and he ended the conversation, clearly annoyed.

So AITA for asking my dad why he doesn't parent my little brother the same way he parented me and my older brother?

As an extra point, I know he's 15 so of course he's gonna swear. It wouldn't bother me as much if it wasn't at the level he does it and gets away with it. 

TL:DR - me and my older brother got yelled at for swearing too often/too harshly but my little bro gets away with it. Asked dad why and he got annoyed."
"AITA for playing guitar in my own apartment? Getting annoyed here... | So I love music, and I play guitar and bass. I've got these complete nightmares of neighbors that live next to me, and since they moaned about my electric gear, I went unplugged. To be honest, I mostly play an unplugged acoustic bass, about as quiet as an instrument gets, like barely audible if there are other instruments or voices or whatever.

And I still get routine visits from my neighbors chewing me out. The apartments are relatively new, and the walls aren't at all thin. I'd wager you'd actively have to be listening for noise to pick up on it. It honestly feels like they are just looking for issues, despite the fact that I've changed the entire way I approach my passion due to them. 

Music is my dream, I've already downscaled it to fit their OCD behavior, and I feel like a huge blow-up is incoming. It's only these 2 people out of like 13 on my floor, 4 other of which also live wall-to-wall that have even noticed I play. ***AITA*** here?"
"AITA for starting a business in direct competition with my father's and making him lose clients? | So I have a father who left our family to start a new one with our neighbor when I was 13. I never fully forgave him even thought he tried (and still does) to make it up to me.

Growing up, he would pay me to work with him in his company. It's pretty advanced construction finishing stuff (like custom molding for many different uses).

I worked with him on and off through college and I've gotten very good at it.

He asked me to join his company full time as  an equal owner after I graduated. But my stepmom had a fit and basically forced my stepbrother into the mix as well.

I do not get along with my stepbrother and told my father that it's either him or me. He also did not have the right skills to work in a major capacity.

To no one's surprise, my father said I needed to compromise so everyone in the family can be happy.

I refused to compromise and went ahead and set up my own company. My father was upset but I guess he figured he couldn't stop me. We continued having weekly dinners.

For some reason, people are liking my company's work more. I have expanded my company more than my father ever has. I also targetted his major clients who have slowly come over to my company. I don't even do any of the labor myself anymore unless I want to.

Last week, my father broke down and said his business was struggling to survive. I admit I did feel bad so I offered him a full time job in my company and that I'd buy out his tools and workshop lease. But I told him my stepmother and stepbrother are not welcome  anywhere near my company.

This made my father pretty angry and we had a pretty big fight. He said I betrayed him. Then I basically told him he betrayed me by cheating on my mother. 

I do feel kind of guilty I ruined my father's company he worked hard to build. But at the same time he forced me into this position by getting his family involved.

I feel like that is a relationship that my sister's boyfriend filled for all of my childhood. My sister dated this guy for close to 13 years. He was even at the hospital the day I was born. We did so many things together....baseball games, vacations, movies, everything. He was a major reason I was such a happy kid. When I was 11, he finally proposed to my sister. I had a brother-in-law. He took me out for our ""child-friendly"" bachelor party. Him, me, and all the groomsman spent the entire night at Dave and Busters. I will never forget the fun I had that night. (A week later they all flew to Vegas for their fun)

Shortly after getting married, things in my sister's marriage took a turn for the worse. Looking back, I'm not sure how I didn't grab the concept that they were splitting up, but It took me a while. He stopped coming around, I stopped doing things with him, and I would also ask my sister, where is he? Looking back I feel horrible for pestering her about why he wasn't coming around anymore, mainly because she was dealing with the divorce that I had no idea was happening.

All of the sudden, my best friend and brother were gone. I became a very lonely kid. It had come apparent that my sister and him had separated and he began seeing another woman before their divorce was official. There's details that I don't feel comfortable saying on Reddit, but my sister did some things that were very unfair to him during their marriage, so I believe they are BOTH at fault for their marriage failing.

Almost 10 years later, I'm going to be 20 years old in just a few weeks. I have never heard from or seen him again. Mainly because my family cut ties with him directly. They really despise him. I don't know why, but last night I did some research and he lives 15 minutes from my apartment. I was in utter shock. He's 40 years old now, married again and from what I found, doing well for himself.

Now here is my question. Would I be the asshole for reaching out to him and trying to catch up? My friends are telling me I'd be betraying my sister for what he did to her. I know for a fact my dad would lose his mind if he found out I tried to contact him. But deep down, a part of me still misses him. He was ripped from my life without a second notice. I never got to see my best friend again. I wan't to just say hi and talk to him about how the last 10 years have been for both of us. I wonder sometimes if he ever thinks of me or if he'd even recognize me if he saw me today. I have his phone number, but I'm contemplating reaching out to him. I don't want to upset my family if this somehow comes out. I don't want to betray my sister either.

Would I be the asshole if I tried to reach out to my sister's ex husband?

"AITA for parking my motorcycle in a spot that isn't a parking spot at the gym? | I have a tank bag on my motorcycle that was stolen once before so I try to park it in busy, well-lit areas when I can.  If there is a spot that is out of the way and not a parking spot I will sometimes use that too.

One spot I use on a very regular basis is next to the bike rack at the gym I go to most weekdays.  There is a paved area about 10'x10' next to the stairs that has a bike rack that's about 5' in the center.  I haven't seen a bicycle parked there ever.  

I often park my motorcycle on the side of it in a way that allows the bike rack to be used and does not block and walking paths etc.  The parking spots near the door are usually full and I get there early in the morning when it's still a bit dark.

I'll admit it FEELS like a bit of a dick move but I can't think of any logical reason for it to be so I do it anyway due to the above-mentioned security concern.  It being closer to the door isn't much of a factor because when I park farther away I put on my helmet, gloves, etc. while walking to the motorcycle.

I asked my very honest friend who sees me parked there and he thinks it's an asshole move which is why I am coming here for judgement."
"AITA for whistling “My Heart Will Go On” everyday in the shower? | I live in a 2 bed 2 bath apartment with 3 other people. Each room has a bathroom in it. I love to whistle but I don’t like to impose my noise on others, so I only do it in the shower with the bathroom door closed. I don’t have a car to whistle in. I usually whistle 2-3 full songs in the shower, which would almost always include “My Heart Will Go On”. I’ve been living in this apartment for two months now with the same people. They never complained until one of my housemates Randy did after I finished showering today. 


He said I was annoying everyone with my whistling, especially whistling that “dumb chick song” every day. I thought the noise wouldn’t be so loud with the shower running and the door closed, so I asked everyone if they could hear me from the living room. They said they could but it’s not a big deal. Randy said my whistling was giving him headaches and asked me to stop. I told him I’ll stop whistling when he stops screaming like a banshee while playing video games in the living room until 3am. He said touché and we agree to continue making our respective noises."
"AITA for Refusing couples therapy | I've been having a crappy time lately. I’ve been under the weather, things at work are very stressful and my job is in doubt, I recently changed my medication and have a lot of grim side effects, a family member is very ill,  and one of my pets has been in and out of the vets with a mystery illness that has been costing a lot of money and I'm being told to prepare for euthansia if he doesn't show improvement soon. I have been spending some nights sleeping downstairs with him monitoring his condition, and other nights visiting family, and helping keep the ship afloat, making dinners and cleaning etc. 

So I'm dealing with a lot. 
It's okay though, I know all these things are temporary, its just shitty, but Im getting through. 

My BF suffers from anxiety and Seasonal affective disorder -he will shut down and hide in bed and cry and ask me to just hold him without explaining what is wrong. He wants a huge amount of comfort and attention and its a very large drain on both my time and emotional energy.

I pushed him to start therapy and he finally did earlier this year. I knew I would not be a support for him the way he wanted long term, and that he needed to learn a more effective coping method.

I know this situation is crap for him;  but I do make time for him. I make him dinner everyday, I make the time to cuddle up on the couch,  I pick up little treats for him when I am out. I ask him how his day is, I ask him how he's feeling, I suggest he do things that bring him joy. 
I just don't have time to be this rock that soothes him to sleep and holds his hand through this like I have before.

We got in a fight over this yesterday, we both called each other selfish. He thinks that I am not prioritizing him and the relationship, and that I have not been supportive enough and have been aloof. Yes I have been aloof, I am dealing with a lot!
I told him that that was rich coming from someone who dedicates 100% of his time wallowing in self pity, it is a known disorder that he knows about and that he needs to be the one who learns to cope with it,  that 90% of my free time was dedicated to caring for, helping or looking after others and he needs a damn reality check. 
I asked him why we have been spending huge money on a therapist if it has had 0 benefit. 
 
He called me an insensitive B*tch. I said I was just calling his bullshit, either therapy isn’t helping, so its a waste of money and he needs a new therapist that will help, or he doesn't want the status quo to change and is refusing to utilize the therapy properly, at which point its a waste of money. 

He wants to do some therapy sessions as a couple to help us work through this and I told him no. Therapy is great, but it is not my priority right now. I don't have the time to go, and we also don't have the budget for his therapy, vet fees, and additional couples therapy atm. I also don't think that I am the problem here, he just has crazy expectations!

Edit: thank you all for your feedback. For those who suggested a break up, i dont advocate making decisions under huge pressure like now, I rather wait until I know its me making the choice and not panic. Never make choices in anger or haste! 

I think a lot of people who have told me I need therapy are people who have never been to therapy and have this magical notion of what it is.  Its not a fix all. Its very hard work and it is emmotionally very intense. Telling people they need therapy is not a solution to every problem, and not everyone can afford it. So marking it as the only solution is 100% a terrible habit in this sub.

"AITA for telling my parents they can't see their grandchildren unless they divorce? | I'm not proud of this.

I'm a mother to 2 children, a boy, age 6 and a girl, age 8.

My parents haven't had the best relationship. I was unplanned when they were 17, they had been dating a year but only got married out of obligation, they've never hidden this from me and have spent the majority of their marriage arguing. They keep separating and living apart for a while until dad moves back in, then they'll argue until they separate again. They've been doing this pretty constantly with little variation since I was about 10 and still do it to this day, and I'm now 32. They openly told me as a child that they were only together because of me, they nearly divorced when I was around 22, and then I got pregnant with my daughter and they agreed to stay together for *my* kids. They only became more committed to that when my ex husband and I divorced about 4 years ago.

They babysat the kids for me last weekend, which was the first time they've ever had them for the weekend. I asked them because they've been ""back together"" for 8 months now and it had been a while since either of them had called me to complain about the other, so I figured things had calmed down a bit for them.

The kids told me when I went to pick them up that it wasn't a very fun weekend because, according to my daughter, ""nanny and granddad were fighting the whole time"". My parents offered me a cup of tea so I sent the kids off to play while we talked.

In the following conversation I said that I'd spoken to the kids and they'd told me what had happened. My parents tried to play it off as no big deal but I told them, essentially, that their arguing had affected me for my whole life, and I don't want that for my kids. I said they never needed to stay married for my sake, and if they stay married for the sake of my children then that won't end well. I told them ""I won't come see you or let you see my kids if you're arguing, and you only argue when you're together, so either end this or we're out.""

My parents replied that I'm not being fair, I can't make them get a divorce, or give them this big an ultimatum, but I don't want my kids around this, so either they need to remove themselves from the situation or I'll remove myself and my children.

My parents have sent me a joint text message (signed from both of them) saying again that I'm being unfair, they love me, they love my children and they don't want to lose touch. I've said again that me and my children will not be visiting until the situation is resolved. They asked if they could come to me. I said they had to come separately. They replied that they've been together for 32 years, it's not as simple as just getting divorced, and I can't give them an ultimatum like this. I have asked them numerous times to see a counselor or get couples therapy and they refuse because they feel they ""might as well just burn the money"".

AITA?

Info: I have asked them recently to see a marriage counselor, and I have asked them to do this at least once a year since I was a teenager. They have always refused. Me outright telling them they need to divorce is my last resort, and I'm not happy about it."
"AITA for wanting my baby to learn of it's heritage? | I recently found out that I'm pregnant. My husband Adam and I are delighted and can't wait, but we had a big argument yesterday evening. 

Adam was raised as a muslim in a very religious household. His dad used to beat him for not praying. By now he hates religion and refuses to have anything to do with it. 

I come from a Jewish family. Nobody in my family is religious and I'm definitely not a believer, but we do still have respect for our culture and identity, and while I don't want to raise the baby with religious beliefs I at least want it to be raised to be proud of it's Jewish culture and heritage. 

Adam doesn't want the baby raised with any kind of religious influence. He's against things like circumcision and ear piercing and I agree with him about that, but he doesn't want the baby being raised with anything of it's Jewish or Muslim heritage. He even said yesterday that he wants to give the baby a ''white'' name, and though it wasn't his exact words he wants to do so to give the finger to the culture he grew up around. 

It turned into a big row. I may not be religious but I'm very proud of my culture and heritage, and am deeply hurt that Adam wants our baby to be raised ignorant of where it comes from. I understand his resentment towards his heritage but I think he's taking it out on me unfairly."
"AITA for suggesting my future roommate split half my mortgage with me? | My(23M) cousin(21F) and I decided we wanted to move out, and be roommates. We get along, make decent money, are independent and where we currently live is an hour commute for me and 40 minutes for her. 

The place we were planning to rent, which is only 10 minutes away from both our jobs would cost around $3k a month including utilities, so split between 2 people would be $1,500 each a month. 

I’ve been working overtime the past few months, got cashed out for vacation time/ PTO I didn’t take, got money back from high interest savings, got a promotion, plus my car is paid off so I’ve been saving up a good chunk of cash and want to use it as a down payment for my first home. 

My mortgage will be $2785. 

I told my cousin I wanted to invest my money wisely and use it towards something that could make me even more money in the future, plus as a home owner you’re free to make changes and do whatever you want with your house. She was very supportive and was still on board with the roommate situation, I told her my mortgage was $2785 so we could split that and pay $1393 each month. 

She told me the situation is different now, we’re no longer renting together and she’d basically be my tenant so she feels as though she shouldn’t have to split. She said at the end of the day it’s my home and I can charge however much I want, but she doesn’t think it’s fair to split the price in half because she wouldn’t get ownership of half the house or get half the money if I sold it. 

We didn’t fight, and no one was visibly upset. We were at a family function, so after that we both dropped it and hung out with our family and got along per usual. 

I can’t help the feeling nagging at me though. Was I the asshole? I’ve never had a roommate and never roomed with anyone before so Idk how this stuff works. 

I asked how much she’d think is fair to pay and she said she’d rent out a room for $600 from me."
"AITA for declining to go wedding dress shopping with a coworker? | I work in an office that's heavily male-dominated and the only two women here are me and a new coworker, Lily, who just relocated to this city a few months ago for her fiance's job. I like Lily as a coworker and we get along fine at work, but we don't have a lot of common interests and I wouldn't consider us friends. We don't ever spend any time together outside the office. 

Yesterday, after I got home from work, Lily texted me to ask what my availability was like the next few weekends because she was hoping to go wedding dress shopping soon and wanted to know if I would come along. She said she didn't have anyone else she could ask because she doesn't have any family in the area and she's been having a hard time making friends in our city. 

I was really flustered by this text because I have zero interest in spending a weekend going dress shopping with someone I don't know that well. I wanted to be kind but direct with her. I wrote back that I was flattered she had asked me but I didn't think that we were close enough for me to feel comfortable accompanying her on such an important occasion. She didn't reply. 

Things have been really awkward between us in the office this morning, and I'm starting to wonder if maybe I was too harsh and should have just sucked it up and done it anyway. AITA?"
"AITA for giving my daughter the same name as her deceased cousin? | Throwra


My (26F) sister (31F) called her daughter *Lili Haven* 

Lili was born 6 months ago

I asked my sister if she would mind if I use the name Haven, I was 6 months pregnant, she didn't mind.

Lili passed away a month later, I'm not sure what happened.

I gave birth two weeks ago, I called my daughter *Haven Marie*

We mostly call her Ven or Marie.

My sister has not been to visit Ven but we're not angry or upset, we assumed it was because she couldn't handle us having a baby so close to the death of hers perfectly normal so I hope people don't assume I'm judging her.

We announced the birth on Facebook, all of my family and all of my husband's family had already met Ven but our friends hadn't.

(Excluding my sister and brother in law)


So we posted a picture of little Ven on Facebook with the caption "" Haven Marie 15/11/19"" 

We immediately get spammed by my brother in law telling us we shouldn't have used his deceased daughters name and we should have checked if it was ok, apparently my sister wont meet Ven until we change her name 

(Haven is our mothers name, Marie is my partners mothers name)

"AITA for telling my girlfriend that she should change her music at our party because the guests didn't like it? | Me and my girlfriend have been going out for over a year now, we just moved in together and we decided to throw a moving in party. The party was maybe 25-40 people, I honestly couldn't count because a lot of people were coming in and going out. 

&#x200B;

The thing is, my girlfriend had control over the music. She was playing... kind of really bland edm-pop stuff like a edm remix of a taylor swift song and ed sheeran and stuff, and I could just absolutely tell that nobody was into it. I think this might be somewhat of an urban/suburban divide, she is from the suburbs where the radio is more popular in general. For one, most of the people there were people I knew, and I know that they wouldn't like it, but also I talked to a few of my friends and they said the music was annoying. 

&#x200B;

I decided to ask her if I could play some music, something that was... you know, crowd pleasing (early 2000s hip hop hits, of course), and not just music that I personally enjoy, and right away you could see people get more excited from the music. About 4-5 songs later, she asked if she could play more music, and I told her yes, but play something different than what she was playing before because a lot of people weren't into it. She got a tiny bit upset at that, and she kept asking me to explain what I meant, and I just said that people didn't want to hear pop music at a party like that, and she got kind of really pissed off at me and took it as a personal attack on her music taste. I kept telling her that it wasn't me, it was more the guests. Truth be told, I didn't like it much either, and I think she could tell that it was also me, but I personally didn't CARE about the music, its more that it was mellowing out the party in a bad way because people didnt like it. She ended up getting really frustrated at me, saying that we've been dating for over a year and I never told her that I thought her music taste was bad. Like, why would I tell her that? We have different music tastes, she knows that. I think she was kind of in denial that the PARTY didn't like the music, and assumed it was entirely ME who was disliking the music. 

&#x200B;

She ended up going upstairs in a pout, and the next day she went to Chicago for a work trip so we have barely spoken since. I felt like an asshole the entire night. I probably shouldn't have said anything about that, it just came off like I was telling her that her music sucked, but she also kind of put me in a tough position there."
"AITA if i recline my airline seat? | The guy behind me is in the back row of the plane and I don’t need to for room, as I’m 5’4”, but I have back pain and reclining will let me function after I land this morning. I don’t need to sleep either.  

This is a hotly departed topic. Usually my answer is that as long as you check for a drink and do it slowly it’s fine, and my response to “it sucks to lose space” is “well, then they can recline theirs,” but the rear row can’t. However, I believe this specific rear row appears to have more room than us - meaning my reclining would put them with the same amount of room, not less than other people have.   

So, Reddit - AITA if I recline my seat? I’ll see you after the flight to find out!

Update: I should’ve said WIBTA...and according to half of you, I am! I reclined because the people behind me had more room (weird, I guess they gave next to bathroom seats a perk to make up for it,) didn’t have drinks, and weren’t tall. I honestly wanted an opinion on if this - with all of those things considered, which I always check for - would’ve been asshole behavior. Many mentioned these in their judgements as to why it’s an asshole move. I only agree in specific cases (a seat with a drink can be reclined okay as long as you check in, get the OK and do it gently) but I suppose an objective opinion is pretty elusive! Thanks everyone."
"AITA for giving a guy tissues on a plane? | So this is something I’ve debated with a few people and the results are 50/50, so I thought I’d ask reddit. 

I (25m) was on a flight from Sydney to LA a couple of months ago, and it was something like a 14 hour flight. I was on the aisle seat and next to me were a couple, we said a quick hello and settled in for the flight. However, it was immediately apparent the guy had a cold as he was sniffing. But he wasn’t blowing his nose, just every minute or two he’d do a wet, snotty inhale. 

I put on my headphones as soon as I could and ignored it. However when I was trying to sleep, I had no ear buds and even with headphones on I could hear him sniffing every other minute. After 30 minutes of trying to sleep and him doing nothing to cover it or deal with it, I’d had enough. 

I opened my overhead and grabbed my packet of tissues, then tapped him on the shoulder, and asked if he had tissues. “No, why?” 

“Because you’ve been sniffing since I got on the flight, and it’s really distracting.” And gave them to him. He stared at me like I’d done something really weird, looked at the tissues and said “right” 

He used them and honestly it was so much better, I got to sleep in no time. The rest of the flight was kinda awkward, instead of asking me to move when they needed the bathroom they just stepped over me and stood on my toes a bit. 

When we landed and we were waiting to get off the plane his partner said I’d made him feel really self conscious and it was a mean thing to do, pointing out that he was ill and that the polite thing to have done was just ignore it. I said I had ignored it til I physically was unable and that it was a disgusting sound to hear again and again from a fully grown man. He looked really embarrassed and hustled off the plane as soon as he could.

When I told my friends the story half agree that it was the right thing to do. The others agree it was an unpleasant sound, but making it so public and the spat with his partner at the end make me the asshole. Honestly I can’t think of a nicer way I could have given him the tissues so, here I am."
"AITA for not letting my wife name our daughter Alexa? | My wife's mom was named Alexa, and she wants to name our daughter after her. Our older daughter was named by me, so we had agreed that she would get to name the next child. However, I feel that this is not a suitable name due to its use by Amazon.

This is more of a minor argument we're having right now (the child is due in 5 months). It's not going to tear the family apart or anything.  I'm sure we'll resolve it one way or another, but it would be nice to hear some opinions."
"AITA for asking my wife not to tattoo her miscarried child’s name with our living child’s | Using a throwaway bc me and wife both reddit. 

My wife (28F) and I (29M) are expecting our first child in October. Were both into tattoos and have a good few, so we both want to honor our child (and hopefully three other future children) with some ink. When talking about it the other day, she said she wants to do names+birthdates, but that she would put the name of the kid she previously miscarried and the date of the miscarriage above our child’s. The miscarriage happened six years ago before I met her with an ex. I know losing a kid was tough on both of them. I also know he’s had a kid since and will still refer to himself as having two kids - the one with my wife and one with his gf now. My wife has kind of followed that, she doesn’t call our child her first and says the one she lost always will be. 

I’m not trying to be the guy whose upset because his wife had a life before him, but I feel weird about her putting the name her and her ex gave the miscarried child on the same level as our child, in a tattoo. I told her that and she got kind of mad and upset at me. I know she thinks of the miscarried child as as much her child as ours, but to me it’s different bc that child never lived, and our kid won’t ever meet that kid. I don’t know if this is just bc it’s not my child though, and I need to shut up and just accept it. 

I have no problem with her getting other tattoos for her miscarried child, I don’t think those are any of my business and I totally support that. I also know I don’t get to tell her what she should ink on her body. But I feel like it was ok for me ask her to reconsider. It just makes me uncomfortable and feel like she hasn’t moved on, which is all I told her. So AITA?"
"AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend after finding out she has depression? | I've been dating this girl for 5 months, and last month, we decided to to make it official. However, she only revealed to me that she has depression last week.

One thing you have to know about me is that I'm a 22-year-old guy who can't handle negative emotions very well. She knew about this even before we started dating, because I was known as the quiet, carefree guy with a dry humor. Whenever there's drama, I'm usually ten feet away from it. She also knows I have A LOT on my plate (health, personal, financial issues), but we pushed through with the relationship believing it would be good for us.

I've also previously dated a girl with depression about 2 years ago. It ended with her almost slashing her wrist in front of me (I don't know if it was a guilt trip tactic or if it was real, but I didn't want to find out), so I pretty much avoided girls with mental illness since then.

When my new gf told me she also has depression and is also suicidal, I was speechless for about two minutes because I was really shocked. She seemed pretty chill and fun when we were hanging out, although there were times she was really down (I chalked it up to work stress), which I thought was pretty normal for people our age. I then told her I could not go through with the relationship and explained why. I tried my best to speak calmly and in the nicest possible way. I was also careful with my words, in the hopes of not triggering her. She was also pretty calm during the conversation, although I could tell she was holding back her tears. Her best friend also called me up to ask if we could give it another chance, but I told her I need time to think

I really thought at the time that I had no choice but to break up with her because I couldn't give her the emotional and physical support that a person with depression demands. However, I'm now having second thoughts because she might do something harmful to herself or others as a result of the breakup, and I care enough to not want anything bad to happen to her.

So, AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend after finding out she has depression given my circumstances?

EDIT: Thank you for all the responses! Just so everyone knows, I am working with my ex's best friend to seek professional help for her (and maybe for me as well, because some of you think I could also use the therapy to deal with the emotions). However, seeing a therapist is hella expensive where I'm from, so we're taking our time.

EDIT2: I don't know what the protocol here is, but to anyone reading this for the first time now, I've already posted an update here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a8anv0/update\_after\_breaking\_up\_with\_girlfriend\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a8anv0/update_after_breaking_up_with_girlfriend_with/)

Again, thanks for all your insights!"
"AITA for telling my friend who revealed she was pregnant? | So, one of my best friends is pregnant. She's only told a select few people. Her best friends, some family and a few others who've asked her directly for various reasons (example: a friend wanting to know why she wouldn't drink when going out).

A friend of mine texted me yesterday telling me, ""\_\_\_\_\_ is pregnant"". To my knowledge, this person shouldn't have known yet, because the pregnant friend was waiting to announce. So I texted the pregnant friend and asked, ""Hey, did you tell \_\_\_\_\_?""

She told me no, and that she wanted to know who told her. So I fished with the other friend, and asked how she found out.

Turns out, my pregnant friend's best friend (and roommate) was the one who told this person. At this point, I know I'm in trouble. I have trouble lying. I'm incredibly bad at it. And now I either have to tell her who told, and start a storm, or lie and tell her something else (maybe that they didn't tell me who told them).

I told her who told. And the roommate/best friend proceeded to deny it, and say I and the other person were lying. And now everyone is pissed at everyone.

AITA? Should I have just stayed quiet?"
"AITA for getting upset at my sister who called my work (science research which involves animal studies) immoral? | We were eating lunch at a restaurant when my lab mentor texted me about an experiment. I told her as such when my sister asked “who’s texting you?” She then asked “is this with animals?” And I said “no, not yet. But we will be moving on to animal studies soon.” 

My sister then looked at me disgustingly and called my work immoral. She asked (not in these exact words) “how can you justify hurting animals?” And I told her that the research we do advances medical technologies which will improve human life. She hits me with the “tell me how is benefiting a human life more important than hurting an animal?” I brought out the classic example and asked “what if someone you loved needed this special equipment but we don’t know if it’s safe so we have to test it on an animal first?” And she screamed at me saying “Don’t you dare bring family into this. Family is emotional. Justify your work without bringing emotions into this.” 

I was silent for a solid 30 seconds. I told her that emotions play such a big factor in everything, you can’t just neglect emotion when justifying my animal research. She continues to argue with me and we just leave the restaurant arguing. I tell her that I’m upset because she’s telling me my work and what I want to do with the rest of my life is immoral and she’s putting my thoughts and perspective beneath hers (she studied philosophy for a bit and kept getting into how immoral this was). We get into the car and she says I’m too emotional, I need to learn that her perspectives are perfectly okay to be different than mind. 

AITA for getting upset and making us leave the restaurant in bad taste after this argument? I cursed at her and called her a bitch, which is uncalled for, for not respecting me, but I also felt so hurt that someone I love would look down on me with such judgmental eyes and say so distastefully that my work is “immoral.”"
"WIBTA if I told my SO's ex to back off? | My boyfriend and I have been in an amazing relationship for a while now. We live together, and we're very happy with the life we've created for ourselves. When we first got together, his ex didn't take it so well. When they broke up it was semi mutual as they both understood they had unsolvable issues, but he instigated it. They had been broken up for only a few months when we got together and they were still on good terms. They would chat occasionally and I was totally fine with this. However, when things got serious between us it clearly crossed a line because she started being rude to him and essentially just crossing boundaries so he cut her off.

He just stopped all communication, but she would occasionally email him. No more texts, but she'd send these long brooding poems that sort of waxed about what used to be or could have been. He was pretty confused by this and felt she was projecting or lonely as they had really both agreed at a certain point that it was best not to continue the relationship. We honestly both felt kind of bad for her as it's a hard situation to go through. He politely ignored it as responding just seemed to trigger further emails. And we weren't really worried about keeping up appearances as she lives across the country and we literally have no social connections in common. It should just be a clean cut.

Another poem was triggered when she saw we went on a trip to Europe together. Again, we cringed and ignored. Cue a year later to today (at this point we've been dating for two years) and he gets ANOTHER email! We were honestly both shocked. Again, it was sort of a non-commital poem, a sort of cry for attention where she was talking about their special connection and how she thought she saw him on the street and all the memories ""came flooding back"".

At this point, I was annoyed. Her self-flagellating musings about how she could have done better in their relationship and how her ""heart aches and the passing of time has only dulled her feelings"" feel to me like she is asking for him back in a roundabout way or at least looking for some validation that he feels some sort of nostalgia as well.

I trust him and he was very weirded out by the message, saying he felt like it was more for her benefit than his as well as calling it ""kinda gross"". He also is of the mind that again we should ignore it as a response would just validate her ploy for his attention.

I know it's probably a dick move but the worse parts of me want to message her and tell her to just get a goddamn journal or something. I'm sure she's sad but bringing that into our life and relationship is selfish and immature. It might be selfish and immature to throw it back at her as well - but I want to so bad. The mean girl in me wants to tell her to get a fucking life...in so many words."
"AITA for favoring son over daughter? | I am 50 (M) - my daughter is a freshman in college, my son is already 25.

Let me just start off by saying I am in no means financially stressed - I have already been retired for 8 years and living off of comfortable money made through investments. I was also able to pay 100% of son's college tuition costs + living costs, and doing the same for my daughter.

Now, my son already has a child who's one years old - really reminds me of when I had my son back when I was 25 as well. However, the company my son worked for went bankrupt a month ago, and although my son already got a well-paying contract at a bank, he needs to wait a month. Why? He's filling up a spot of some bank management guy who's going to retire in a month. So in the meantime, I told my son to spend time with his family and I'm paying all of his family's living costs for just that one month time span.

On the other hand, my daughter is still with her highschool-era boyfriend in college. Now, both my wife and I attempted to tell her we candidly did not think much of her bf, but since she was adamant about her choice, we told her she can pursue that relationship if she takes all responsibility as well. The bf's a shady fellow who uses words like ""dat lit dude"" and stuff like that, dropping the f-bomb every two sentences or so. Anyways, daughter and bf had a consensual decision to *have a child in college* when none of them have decent income. I know. How dumb can you be? My wife and I tried so hard to convince her (we even flew to her college to warn her after she stopped taking our calls), but alas, my daughter's life is her life.

The thing is, my daughter wants money from me now so she can support her child, saying I was shelling out money to her brother anyway. I told her she won't get a cent from me as she made a dumb choice, so it was her responsibility to take care of her. She was livid. I know, my wife and I failed at parenting her, but I still think that it's my daughter who's ultimately responsible for the child at least.

So AITA?

**NOTE:**  I am already paying 100% of daughter's tuition, plus $23,000 a year for living expenses which I plan to give her for all 4 years of her college. A kind redditor mentioned this means $480 for my daughter to spend per month. However, I do not plan to increase that amount just because my daughter had a child.

**NOTE 2:** Main reason I dislike daughter's bf is because that guy did not try to spend time with me or my wife *at all*. He only came to us when we summoned him. Now, my son's wife actively called us, checked in with us, asked my wife on advice to get closer with son, etc. That's why I respect son's wife and not daughter's bf."
"WIBTA if I Refuse to Attend my High School Graduation | I'm a high school senior, graduating in a few months. I do not intend to go to my graduation ceremony. High school has been a horrendous four year experience and I would like to leave it behind me as soon as possible. I dislike my school and am not incredibly fond of my peers.

My family however, would very much like for me to attend the ceremony. I understand that part of them wanting me to go is so they can take pictures and cherish the memory. Their justification is that it will only be 2 hours long at most (small graduating class) and I would be able to have an official conclusion/send off.

WIBTA if I absolutely refused to attend graduation? Meaning, if worst comes to worst, I would play hooky on the graduation day.

Edit: I'm surprised by the amount of comments I got. Thanks guys! I don't have time to reply to all of them, but if anyone was still curious, I talked to my parents and we came to a compromise. We agreed on going out for a nice dinner instead and taking our own photos :)"
"WIBTA if I continue to complain about the way the prize pool in my office's GoT deadpool was distributed? | I placed tied first in my office's deadpool. First place was $110, second was $70, third was $50. Today I received an email saying:

>""Attached is the final Game of Thrones outcome and in true Game of Thrones style, it didn’t pay to win ;)  
>  
>Each place will be divided between the number of people in that place.  
>  
>1st: $55 each  
>  
>2nd: $70  
>  
>3rd: $25 each""

I was pretty dumbfounded, I've never seen a prize pool split this way before, where the winners receive less for winning than they would have if they came second, so sent back:

>Yay, Thanks for organising this! A bit confused about the prize distribution, though. Conventionally, if there is a tie for first, the 1st and 2nd prize pool is shared between the two winners (i.e. $90 1st, $90 1st, $25 3rd). Was just curious if there was a reason the prize pool was split differently here

She replied with:

>Heya,  
   
No worries, well done!!  
   
We did it this way because that’s how we’d been communicating the leaderboard the whole way along.  
   
I sense checked it with a few people before anyone knew who’d won.

I'm considering whether I should take this further, but I'm not sure if I'm in the right or wrong here. To me, it seems like a scene out of The Office, but am I Jim or Michael?"
"WIBTA if we “forget” my husband on Father’s Day? | TLDR My husband didn’t wish me a happy Mother’s Day or birthday.  Should his day be overlooked as well?

For context:  on both Mother’s Day and my birthday, my husband was very aware of the events (we were going to brunch with his family on Mother’s Day; my 7 years old wished me a happy birthday in front of him).  I didn’t expect an extravagant gift and in the past it has varied between homemade to something bigger for both of us.  I didn’t get a card, gift, or verbal acknowledgement from him this year.  To be clear, the thing that hurts me is that he never said anything/recognized me on either days.  

I did say something to him after the fact that he didn’t wish a happy birthday or Mother’s Day to me and he replied that he was sick on my birthday (he had a cold) and was angry with me on Mother’s Day.  I was running late trying to get my oldest and the baby ready to go.  In my defense I started two hours before the agreed upon Mother’s Day brunch time but since it was our first time going out with the newborn baby, I just couldn’t get it together in time so told them to go without me because I didn’t want my daughter to miss out on seeing her grandma.  They did go without me btw.  

He did eventually get me a small birthday present, which he left on the kitchen counter but it was one of those “too little, too late” situations and I still feel hurt.  

So WIBTA if we “forgot” Father’s Day this year?  

I’m conflicted and honestly confused.  As I’ve said, I’m still.. hurt by what happened and have no desire to recognize him on Father’s Day.  At the same time, this isn’t for me; it’s for my daughter and I don’t want my feelings to impact her day with dad.  She did make him a homemade Father’s Day card for the day though so he will get something..  

Also when I take a step back to see what this would achieve, I don’t think it’d be productive..  but I’m still angry and I don’t think he should have a day this year.  

Thanks in advance."
"AITA for going to Comic Con against the wishes of my wife after she went to Diseyland and didn't invite me? | Okay, here goes. This happened about 2 weeks ago. First of all, I'm pretty much your typical hyped Star Wars and Marvel Universe fan. I watch all the movies and own a bunch of merch in thousands of dollars pretty much. I saw Endgame and captain Marvel recently and it was probably highlight of my year, and surpassed Last Jedi as my favourite Disney movies. So imagine my excitement when my wife said that she wanted to take her son to the Disney World. I immediately started shaking and laughing, as I've always wanted to visit. However, when I asked her ""so when are we gonna go? I need to check if it's okay with work."" She looked at me kind of seriously and said ""What do you mean?"" I was confused and didn't know what to say so there was bit of an awkward silence, until she broke it by saying ""Oh, you wanted to come too?"" I felt like being punched in the stomach, and there was another awkward silence. She explained that she used all our miles for them and her ex, and there wasn't enough left for me. Plus she said something like ""aren't you getting too old to be interested in things like this anyways?"" It felt like there was piece stuck in my throat and I thought I would say something I would regret, so I just grabbed my Switch and stormed out and spent the evening in the park. After returning home, I apologized to her for the way I reacted. She understood, and we first had a more mature talk where I offered I would pay for my own flight and hotel room, however, she said that we can't really afford it right now, and she suggested we go to arbies when they get back. We got into bit of an argument when I asked why it was okay for her ex to come then, she said it's only for her son (She and her ex are still really good friends die to joint custody, even though they broke up 7 years ago,) and while I understand that her son would want his father to be there, I don't accept that he would take precedence over me, especially since I'm the one mostly paying for it. She said it's for her son. I threatened that if I was left out of their trip, I would go to the comic con by myself (I had wanted to go there, but she was adamantly against it because it was too expensive.) She got angry and called me childish and jealous. I refused to back down, and she stopped speaking to me, even after they came back from the trip. I went to comic con and had a blast, but I still feel a bit guilty, so am I the a hole?"
"AITA for cutting off my step sister? | i met my “step sister” (S) when she was 11 and i was 15. we hit it off at first but over time she became insane.

S is not related to my step father or me at all, but he married her mother when she was around 3. he raised her and she always thought of him as her second dad. he and her mother got a divorce because her mother is crazy (schizophrenic) and did drugs + other things.

we would see each other once in a while and she would stay with us for the weekend. she would make everything about her when she was over and one time told my best friends little sister she was fat and ugly. (she was 15 at the time and the girl was 10) when i moved out she stole a bunch of my good makeup and jewelry that i had left behind. 

about a year ago she was claiming her bio dad was being inappropriate with her. she would tell all of us this and we later found out it was because her mother would let her do drugs / party etc and her dad made her do chores and punished her. 

well then, her biological dad OD’ed on heroin. and all of a sudden she was ‘oh woe is me my dad died look at me i lost my dad’ and she’s still doing that TO THIS DAY. i get it, she lost her father and i won’t understand, but she’s constantly bringing it up. she won’t even speak to me or my stepfather. and when she tries to talk to him she messages him on facebook when we’ve told her that he doesn’t respond on there and to text / call him. and she WONT. and then she will post shitty things on facebook about him. it hurts my stepdad so badly because he Raised this girl. he loved her as his own and she only uses him when she needs him.

she will message me if it’s about ‘drama’ with her friends to get me on her side when she’s in the wrong. & i agree with her to not cause a fight. she’s told us time and time again she would come visit since i’ve moved back (february and it’s now july). 

she bad mouths my sisters and my mom. she makes everything about her. constantly wanting attention or pity and i’m honestly tired of it. i completely ghosted her and don’t respond to her messages and she’s flipped her shit on me for it and had her mom go off on me too.

am i wrong for this?

edit to add : she’s done a lot more things than just this. and ALL she did while her bio dad was alive was talk about how much she hated him etc. yes i get it, her dad died, but jesus christ you do not need to bring it up in EVERY single conversation.

also yes her mother is crazy. she’s upset because my step dad found someone who cares about him and not to mention stole 30,000$ from my stepdad and makes rude ass comments about him all the time. and tried to send him explicit pictures of herself.

we’ve tried getting her help but we have no say in her getting it. she’s still a minor and her mom won’t do anything."
"AITA for not going to a wedding I sorta pushed to get invited to? | So this happened a long time ago, but I'm still very confused about what was right and what/who was wrong. Sorry for the long story.

So I was in a pretty serious relationship at the time. One day his older sister comes in and they let me know she just got engaged, and she says something like ""so you know, mark your calendar for next year"". (If it's relevant, the core of the family is REALLY close knit, and the wedding was like 150+ guests)

**A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THE WEDDING:**  
My boyfriend starts talking about the wedding preparations, etc. He's never mentioned me attending, so I'm not sure if I'm invited or not. **I know nothing about wedding etiquette, so I didn't know if I was supposed to get a verbal invite, if it was assumed I was going, assumed that I wasn't, etc.** Eventually I become pretty sure I'm not invited. I'm hurt to be honest, but figured maybe it's normal and I'm not supposed to be invited.

**TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE WEDDING:**  
my parents bring it up, I say that I'm not invited and they kind of freak out. They say that it's pretty insulting, that I should absolutely be invited since I'm a long term gf of the brother and they are all very close. I defend him and say it's not a big deal, but really, I'm a little hurt, I just don't know if I'm entitled to feeling left out and if my parents are wrong.

**I end up asking my bf if I was invited or not**, and he makes sort of a ""this is awkward gesture"" and tells me that they don't know yet, because a lot of guests have started asking to bring their +1, which keeps increasing the wedding size, and now they don't know if I can come. He tells me that he'll probably know in a few days if I can come.

I get a little more upset, because even to me it seemed that I should be put before a lot of extra unintended guests? But also because it's 2 weeks before the wedding and it sounds like the extra requests are a recent issue, while I've been on hold for a year? And I'm supposed to go back to college (5 hrs away) around the same time of the wedding, so I kinda need to know to organize, get a dress, etc. He doesn't really see the problem and just shrugs it off, thinking that I'm getting worked up over nothing.

**Three days or so later he calls me and tells me that I'm officially invited now.** By then I've mentioned it to a couple of friends and they were all seething on my behalf, some even saying that this is stuff they would break up over? So by then I felt pretty humiliated and had started to be actually offended.

So I tell him that honestly I didn't want to come anymore, that I felt a little embarrassed to show up to a wedding that I had practically had to push to be invited to. He implied that I was TA because I was being petty and childish, and after the wedding he made me feel pretty bad because ""everyone kept asking where I was"" and it had been awkward for him.

So, AITA for having said no at the end? Was this whole invite timeline normal and I made it out to be more than it should?

*Edit to clarify: 1. I was never clear on what exactly happened behind the scenes. In hindsight I think that maybe his family thought I was invited all along and my bf bottlenecked the invite, but I'm not sure why or if it was intentional. At the time though, I think I was mostly hurt that my bf didn't seem to care about me attending by keeping me on standby.

2. Since I thought I wasn't invited, my family and I had already planned to take me back to college that same weekend. Rescheduling the trip for the wedding would have been inconvenient for us, but I could have done it. I didn't because I WAS offended and didn't want to tell my family we had to reschedule because I was just now invited. So, mostly hurt pride."
"AITA for letting my son wear my husband’s clothes? | My son is 16 and I allow him to occasionally borrow clothes from my husband’s closet to supplement his wardrobe, especially in “winter” because we only have about two weeks of chilly temperatures where we live and it seems wasteful to spend money on warm clothes that may or may not be needed. 

My son is very responsible and has never ruined or lost anything that doesn’t belong to him. This morning it was really cold so I gave him a zip up jacket from my husband’s closet. When my husband came home, he was super annoyed even though he didn’t need it today for himself. AITA?"
"AITA for not doing the gardening when my wife asked me to? | We live in a condo, we pay dues for outside maintenance. We don't pay a ton, and that is partially because my wife is on the HOA board.She does a good job in doing so.

We got a new plant this year, planted by the landscaper on the outside of the house. My wife may or may not knew this, I guess it does not matter. I do not notice the plant, to be honest.

2 weeks later, she gets a email that states the new plant is dying. Cue panic mode on her part.

She asks me to water the plant. My response:

Me:Why do i have to water the plants? don't we have a landscaper for that and a sprinkler system?

Wife: Yeah, but you need to water it because it is dying!

Me: What happened to our sprinkler system?

Wife: (getting a little annoyed) We(the HOA) shut it off, it wastes water(the HOA pays for  the water in our complex) besides the sprinklers won't reach there! (neither of  us know this

Me: (getting a little annoyed) I still don't see why I have to water the plants, especially when it sat for 2 weeks and this is the first I hear of it, now we are behind the curve and we are not gardeners.(not to mentioned it rained a lot this month) Not to mention I didn't even plant the thing

Wife: They will charge us for it! Where is your sense of pride?, we pay low dues, so the landscaper isn't going to come and water the plants!

Me: Fine, Ill water it.

So, I do. I do not have a green thumb, and I bought a condo with all of its drawbacks specifically so i wont have to mess with outdoor stuff like this. So I water this damn plant at least a dozen times over the summer. She waters it once.

It's still dying, despite all of the water i put on it,(and the rain it got) I feed it plant food, despite the fact I really feel I shouldn't  have to, Why am I paying dues?, Note at all of other other landscaping is doing OK. Fast forward to yesterday.

Wife I need you to prune the plant its dying still and I have a walkthrough tomorrow.

Me: Sorry, but I wont be doing that, you know what I think about us doing outside maintenance.

Wife, But I have a walkthrough tomorrow! Why don't you do it!

Me, I ma not going to, I bought a condo not to do this and you know it. Besides I watered it this summer, and it still didnt come back, perhaps this time you can prune it,

Wife (gets mad)

&#x200B;

AITA here? I mean it was a quick prune, and I feel bad (kinda) for not doing it, but I feel she didn't respect my boundaries, (She asked 3 times, so I said no 3 times). Why was I anointed to be the plant caretaker?

"AITA if I want to put Poo-Pourri in my dad’s Christmas stocking this year? | Pretty self explanatory. My dad absolutely destroys the bathroom on a regular basis, causing it to emanate through the rest of the house. It’s beyond nauseating and, if guests are over, embarrassing. Well, dad being dad, thinks this is absolutely hilarious. And, since he has no sense of smell, adamantly refuses to use any sort of toilet spray to help the rest of our noses get some relief.  

Pretty fed up with this being a regular thing, I suggested to my mom that we invest in some spray for dad for Christmas and insist that he show us the respect of using it. Mom, inevitably, thinks this an asshole move. So, AITA? 

P.S. I already got him a nice gift that we thought he’d enjoy. This wouldn’t be the only thing ending up in his stocking, don’t worry. "
"AITA for telling my football-hating wife that I'd rather she not invite her coworkers, who I don't know, to a Superbowl get-together at our new home? | **Background:**

First things first; she hates football. Will leave the room rather than endure being in the same area where she can hear game audio. 

This doesn't bother me. She has her interests and I have mine.

We're both somewhat introverted, but neither of us buckles in social situations. Very functional but it burns premium fuel etc etc..

**Situation:**

My team is the 49ers, and as some may guess I'm absolutely fucking stoked for the game. Ravens and a power-outage did me dirty 7 years ago. In other words, I have skin in the game and would love nothing more than to enjoy it with some long-time high school friends that I play fantasy football with. 

Enter the asshole: She asked if she could invite some of her close friends and some co-workers over for the game. If I say yes, she will have more of her non-football loving friends than I had invited. Basically steamrolling my plan. 

I told her I would really prefer it if she didn't for a few reasons. Most importantly, my team is in the game and I don't want small talk and all the other spectacles pulling the attention from the game. I don't want to talk about my favorite Geico commercial, Emily. I also don't know these people and would prefer to not feel the pressure of hosting strangers when all I want is to watch a game with some close friends that I know care about the game.

We just moved in October so I know some of this is wanting to share the house we love with her friends, and I get that. But **I said to throw a house party or literally any other get-together and I'm fine with it**. I don't see why she thinks it's fair to co-opt something as meaningful to me as this game for the sake of stuntin'.

Selfish? Sure, but I think it's understandable in this context. Or AMITA

**TL;DR**

Wife has 0 interest in football but wants to invite her friends/co-workers to co-opt my get-together to make us the minority. I said nah."
"AITA for telling my sister that she should date less attractive men? | My sister is 31 years old and is constantly complaining about having her heart broken, she complains that men just use her, are never looking for a relationship, don't like her because she is dark skinned etc... Just constant complaning. 

&#x200B;

My wife suggested that she could go on a date with one of her friends from college. When my wife showed her the picture my sister said 'uh no thanks, he will be completely bald in a couple years.'

&#x200B;

I told her flat out, that she needs to be realistic about her options. I told her that she should date guys that are less attractive, if she doesn't want to constantly be ghosted like she is. That she isn't a model herself.

My wife said I shouldn't have said it the way I did, that I should have been softer. I told her that my sister has been struggling with the same problem her whole life. That the time for being soft ended a long time ago."
"AITA for putting a lock box on our thermostat? | To start, I live in a house with 3 friends. We haven't really gotten along the best since we moved in, I assume its just cause were all different in terms of how we live (cleanliness and such). 

A couple months ago we started to turn on the furnace as it was getting cold. One of my roomates would turn it off everytime he left or at night when he decided it wouldnt affect him. He would also then turn it up to 71 but would complain when he came home and saw it back at 69. We live in Wisconsin, our house is poorly insulated. Temps would drop as low as 55 when it was turn off. I have gotten very sick of having to turn the heat back on at least twicr a day. After countless attempts of getting him to stop turning it off I said fuck it and tossed on a lock box so he couldn't touch it anymore. I also decided to leave it at 68 so our heating bill doesnt get ridculous. I realize this is a bit petty, he seemed pretty upset when he'd seen what I'd done. My other 2 roomates seem to prefer to spend less and leave it on a lower temp all the time but they will sit on a fence to avoid confrontation. Am I the one being an asshole here?"
"AITA For Calling Out BS on Social Media? |  I was on facebook browsing our city's group when i saw the post about donating to the guy who is a wheelchair because of a car crash, well the guy was actually in a car crash but he was on drugs (ecstasy or LSD, i dont know im not an expert in drugs) and was DRIVING. So i wrote a comment calling them out saying "" I don't think you should ask for money when it clearly was your sons fault""

"AITA for not going vegan when my partner asks me to? | I know the title makes it sound worse than it is, bear with me. Also throwaway because my partner uses reddit. Obligatory comment re: formatting because I'm on mobile etc. 

I (27F) have a mild dairy allergy, it usually manifests as sniffles, I generally have a chronic runny nose or some sort of cough. I get very frequent sinus/chest infections and generally am a bunged-up, sniffly individual. I also have pretty nasty allergies and a few other autoimmune conditions that generally lead to my health not being amazing and I get sick pretty often.

All of this usually goes away during the periods where I eat vegan - I'm vegetarian and eat vegan I'd say 4 days of 7. Sometimes I'll take a notion and go vegan for a couple weeks at a time and during these periods my general sniffly-ness and infections etc go away and I usually feel great. But I love cheese and I love ice cream so here I am, sniffling and coughing away.

Anyway, my partner (29M) whom I live with has asked that I just stick with vegan to stop my sniffling/coughing/general snottiness. We live together and he says he's sick of my sniffling, going through tonnes of tissues and being sick every few weeks. I should maybe include he isn't vegan or vegetarian, but mostly eats that way because I do most of our cooking.

I can admit that I'm probably pretty disgusting and snotty to be around when I'm going through a bad spell. And someone who is sensitive to noise probably couldn't cope with me. But I've been with him 8 years and this is only now becoming an issue. I've been like this my whole life so I personally barely notice anymore, this is just my reality (I say this until I have a sinus infection next week and I'm sick in bed but anyway). Also, cheese. 

So, reddit, AITA for not going vegan and stopping my general snottiness?

EDIT: Wow thank you guys! For some background, I eat mostly dairy free - I've subbed in a lot of dairy free options, don't drink milk etc. However where I'm from dairy free ice cream/cheese is super expensive, and generally not that great. I usually eat it as a treat because my partner really enjoys various cheeses etc and it's something we do together. 

But thank you - I guess I AM TA. Better start on the train to at least dairy free. Thanks!"
"AITA for not thanking my husband for apology flowers? | There's been this issue between us, off and on, for a couple months and he's really good at trying to ignore it. It came up yesterday through text while he was at work. I said we needed to talk after he got home. Because I believe nothing gets better without talking about it. It hasn't yet. He came home and acted like everything was all good. I, admittedly, was passive aggressive at that point (for that I am the AH) and he completely ignored me the rest of the night. This morning I asked him if he was going to talk to me tonight or do what he did last night and act like there's nothing wrong. He got pissy. I'm the one with the issue (yes but it's OUR issue), there isn't really a problem (if we're fighting about it that makes it a problem) and if I want to talk about it then I need to start the conversation (that is honestly valid). There were other things said. It wasn't what I would call a civil conversation but no one was yelling or making personal jabs. Then he went to work. A couple hours later I get flowers. He asked if anything had been delivered and I told him I got them. That they're pretty. He responded, ""You're welcome?"". I told him I didn't know what to say and neither of us have said anything more. AITA if I don't thank him? Should it make a difference if he apologizes?

Please focus on my specific question. We're both the  AH as far as the arguing goes.

Edit: For those of you saying the flowers gave me a chance to open the conversation, we don't text about serious personal matters. He's shown other people our conversations. After the first time one of his co-workers told me I confronted him about it and told him I felt it violated our privacy. Talking to people or asking for advise is completely acceptable but that made me uncomfortable. Then he did it again at least the one time I was told about. So I just won't anymore and he knows that."
"AITA for not letting my niece pet the dog I'm sitting | TLDR: My niece kicked the dog I'm dog sitting she didn't apologize I tried telling her on other occasions to apologize to at least get the ball rolling on learning how to apologize she doesn't I don't let her pet the dog before she leaves and she ends up crying.

I'm dog sitting a friend's dog until Monday and she's a small dog very well trained if she needs to do her business she waits by the door. I've play fought (grabbing her snout shaking it and her trying to bite my hand I stop and she stops once i start petting her) with her before and I know what she sounds like when she's playing. My niece is 3 years old and she's speaking more and more and honestly she's a spoiled child mostly because she's our only niece (I'm her only uncle and I have 2 more sisters and add our parents) so yes spoiled. They're both around the same height.

Just yesterday my grandma who is here visiting us has been babysitting my niece while my sister is at work and this is the dog and my niece's first time meeting and naturally my niece plays with her and they're running around I let them have fun while I'm on my phone nothing new, then i hear the dog growl big difference between the sounds she does when we're play fighting I let it slip and I go to eat and as I'm putting a spoonful of rice and beans I hear the dog yelp and growl and see my niece kick the dog right in the face and I yelled at her for it. I kept in my room with the dog after to get her away from my niece about an hour or two go by i go back out to try to lighten things up by teaching her how to pet the dog and i ask her if she can apologize because it wasn't cool which she said no and ignored me I got more upset and kept the dog away from my from her for the rest of the day.

Today at dinner i put the dog in the restroom so we can eat in peace and so she's not giving us puppy eyes cause she already ate. We finish up, the food is still out and the dog is still in the restroom. My mom has my niece on top of the counter and she's giving her bits of the turkey leg to eat and she farts really loudly and we laugh and i tell her to apologize because at least she can have a learning moment on manners at the very least and she doesn't do it but it's cool maybe next time. My sister arrives to pick her up i let my niece chase the dog for a bit. Once she was saying no to my sister on putting her shoes on i tell her to put them on or I'll put the dog up and same goes for when she was asked to put her sweater on this time she throws the sweater at my sister and i tell her to apologize because she's out of hand again and she doesn't do it. I tell her no to petting the dog before she leaves and she starts crying. 

My sister told me before they left that i was being too harsh. It's frustrating to see that no one else backs me up when i ask for her to apologize she kicked the damn dog which is absolutley no ones in the family, the fart was funny it will happen again and her throwing the sweater at my sister is on my sister herself on how she lets her do whatever."
"AITA for letting a pregnant woman cut in line for the restroom? | I’d like to think I wasn’t the asshole for this, but I might’ve inconvenienced a whole line of women. I might also be an asshole for assuming she was pregnant, but... this isn’t about that. 

I’m next up in line for the restroom at a popular tourist spot. This line is almost out the door, and 2/5 stalls are out of service. Right before I go up, I looked back and saw a very pregnant woman standing at the very back. An 8-lb little human pressing on her bladder can’t be fun, so I let her cut and go next.

 Her mother follows her and waits outside the door until she’s done. No stalls have been emptied during this. Once she’s done, her mother took her turn, holding up the line about a minute more. At that point, I felt a little guilty for indirectly holding up the line by letting two people cut. After they were done, I dashed in and didn’t want to look back at how bad the line’s gotten.

It’s kind to let a pregnant woman go ahead but I feel guilty for technically letting two people cut in a line of people needing to use the restroom. Some might’ve REALLY needed it. Some people in line were kiddos, too. 

Reddit, AITA for making a line of women wait for the restroom an additional 5 minutes?

EDIT: I didn’t mean to make Grandma look like an asshole, I’m sorry if my writing made it look that way! Thanks for your votes!"
"AITA for smacking the shit out of my 8-year-old nephew for stealing hundreds of dollars of my Pokemon cards and taking some of them to school and trading with them? | Little bit of backstory: I really enjoy Pokémon and play competitively in tournaments and open a shit ton of packs. Doing this means I have a very large collection of valuable cards. I still love at my parents house (I’m 18), and I keep them all on a shelf in my room. My nephew is 8, almost 9 and he and my niece is living with us because my sister abandoned them for some druggie on the streets. 

Anyway, a few days ago I got home from work and was wanting to edit one of the decks I had built for the tournament later in the day. I go to pick up a few deck boxes and a binder and found that one of my binders, and 3 of 9 deck boxes were missing. I immediately freak out because I have them all very organized and well-kept. My nephew has **a lot** of behavioral issues and gets in a lot of trouble both at home and school. He also isn’t ever really disciplined because it would make the situation worse(you’d understand if you met him and my family). So I go into his room to look for them. Lo and behold, there they are, scattered all over the floor, most of them taken out of sleeves, some bent, some of them was thrown in his backpack—oh and my binder was completely empty. At this point I was *beyond* furious and all I could mutter was “ Oh my God” over and over. 

After I pick everything up that I could find, I go upstairs and casually bring him back down to his room and then start screaming at him, and demanding him to find the rest of them. He kept saying he didn’t do it and he didn’t steal them, that they were in his room when he woke up and he thought they were his (keep in mind he lies about *everything*). So I get even madder if that’s possible and I smack the shit out of his leg. Then he starts screaming bloody murder and my nstep dad comes down and demands to know what’s going on. I couldn’t even get a word out before the child went up to him and said I was trying to kill him. My nstep dad coddles him and then gets in my face and threatens to beat me to death if I ever lay another finger on him. 

After they question him for about an hour, he finally admits that he took them to school and was trading and giving them away with his classmates. His punishment: a stern warning and no tv for the night (which he screamed and cried over). He also said he hates me and wished I would just move out and die. My parents then berated me for a while and essentially told me that I’m a child abuser and if I did that again they would have to call the police and have me charged with assault (mostly my nstep dad saying this, my mom understood what I did and didn’t make it a big deal). All in all I recovered most of the cards losing about 20 out of 250, but with all of the damage that was done to some of the cards I probably lost about $180 of cards. 

So am I the asshole in this situation? Was I overreacting by disciplining him because my parents don’t? I get that it’s not my place to do that, but I completely think that it was deserved and I honestly feel that I should’ve smacked him again. He goes back to school today and I have already contacted his teacher and explained the situation; thankfully, she’s going to confiscate every Pokémon card she finds and let me come in after hours to find which ones are mine. Sorry for the lengthy post but I needed to vent my frustrations. AITA? 

TLDR: nephew went in my room and stole approximately 250 valuable cards while I was working; I get home and find out and I smack the shit out of him. Then I’m threatened to be killed/ be turned into the police for assault the next time I put my hands on him. 

Edit: holy shit my inbox 
and to clear up a few things:

nStepdad means narcissistic stepdad which is a term from /r/raisedbynarcissists 

I made this post looking for objective opinions, I personally think he deserved it but what I did was wrong and therefore I’m an asshole. 

We made it to front page :O now everyone will know I’m an asshole D:

"WIBTA For Requesting a Refund After An Employee Wrote Bible Verses All Over My Takeout | Okay this is weird. My husband and I ordered door dash tonight and we requested from a small restaurant in town. The thing is, EVERY takeout item they wrote some sort of Bible verse. Upon looking on their website they don't appear to be overly religious. I just think it's really messed up to push your religion on someone like that and I wish I would've ordered elsewhere. What do you guys think? Was this over the top and I'm justified in requesting a refund?


Edit: since a lot of people have asked. No I have not eaten the food. I would never eat food and then request a refund that is an automatic AH in my book.

Edit 2: Since this blew up and most people thought I would be the asshole I did not request a refund or complain to the manager. I can only assume that this is normal for them and I won't be doing business again. Also had no idea about in and out. I live in the Midwest so I haven't had it but one or two times."
"AITA For Getting Upset My Wife Gave Our Son An Unprescribed Drug? | So yeah.  I came home from work today, grabbed something to eat.  My two kids, three and seven, were in the living room with my wife, older kid completely asleep on the couch.  My wife came over to me and leaned in, told me that our older kid had had multiple meltdowns tonight.  When she says meltdowns, this means pretty much freaking out, hyperventilating, crying, tantrumming---usually over absolutely trivial things.  The other kid touched one of his toys he wasn't using.  He was asked to not throw dirty socks on the floor.  We're out of bananas.  He lied and got called on it.  Whatever.  Absolute no-reason-for-this-eruption freakouts.  Reasoning and explaining gets us nowhere, and oftentimes we have to put him in his own room alone as it's the only thing that calms him down, even though it causes him to freak out three times as hard at first as he thinks he's being exiled and not loved.  He is \*very\* loved.

For clarity, he is in therapy for impulse control, ADHD, and personality concerns.  He's always been....""sensitive"" about everything.  And my wife and I have talked about getting him on to some form of medication to help him.  We didn't want to go that route initially, tried therapy and other strategies, but it's gotten to the point now that we're pretty convinced we should try something.  Also for clarity, my wife is a medical professional with the ability to write prescriptions for her patients.

So my wife leans in, explains the meltdowns, and tells me she gave the kid half of a clonidine pill (she had some left over from a previous prescription).  I told her I wasn't okay with that, that she should have consulted me, that I'm pretty sure it's illegal to give children drugs that aren't prescribed to them, and that I don't know what affect it will have on him.  She got upset with me, saying that she's a provider and knows what she's doing.  I told her that prescribing your own child is a conflict of interest medically, that no one should take drugs not prescribed to them, and that I would prefer that if we're going to give a seven-year-old anything, it go through the proper channel of doctor-prescription-pharmacy-parent.  

She got really upset with me.  Saying she would never hurt our kid, she knows what she is doing, etc.  She was hurt because she felt like I had insulted her ability as a medical professional.  I told her that I don't doubt that at all (I don't), but that I don't agree with the process.  I asked her how she would feel if she came home from work and the babysitter told her she had given the kid a half a Xanax to calm him down.  She said that was different, as the babysitter is not a medical pro.  I said it's not different, it's someone giving a child a drug they're not prescribed.  So now she stormed out and won't talk to me.  AITA here?"
"WIBTA if I stop paying for my daughter’s college expenses if she gets cosmetic surgery? | I’ve been a single mother of two kids for seven years now. My daughter is in her third year of college and my son is a senior in high school. I promised them that I would financially support them fully through college, and after that, they’re on their own. My daughter called me up yesterday to tell me that she plans on getting a breast augmentation surgery. Her first consultation is in two weeks. She plans to pay for it with the money she has saved up through the allowances I have continually given her since she was in elementary school. She has never held a part-time job before. 


I tell her that her priority should be focusing on her education to start a good career when she graduates. The boob job can wait. If she goes through with it, I would stop paying for her tuition, rent, and cut off her monthly allowance. She gets upset and complains about getting her small boobs from me. She goes on to say that she expected I of all people would support her decision, knowing firsthand the drawbacks of being small-chested. I tell her that it really isn’t that huge of an issue. It might seem like one when you’re younger, but it really isn’t at all in the big picture. I tell her my decision was final and that she should reconsider the necessity of a boob job at this point in her life. WITBA if I stopped paying for her college expenses if she goes through with it? Also AITA for how I handled the conversation?"
"WIBTA if I confront our new neighbor for asking an inapropriate question? | Okay, so this is a fairly odd situation that I am still figuring out my next move for. My boyfriend and I recently moved into a new neighborhood with his mom and we have been here about a month and a half. I am a server and also a student, so my schedule is fairly packed, and my only day off is Fridays (this is important). My boyfriend's job recently closed and he is currently still in the process of getting a new job, so he has been home nearly every day since he has no job to go to. 

Last night, after getting home from work, my boyfriend mentioned that his day was extremely weird and went on to explain a ""conversation"" (in quotes because it wasn't a warranted chat nor one that lasted long at all). Apparently one of our neighbors, who I have yet to meet, came up to my boyfriend while he was smoking on the porch and said (paraphrasing since I wasn't there), ""I noticed your girlfriend works a lot; if you ever want to to try some stuff with a guy let me know."" My boyfriend said that he said, ""uhm, okay..."" and went inside. So after hearing this, I was pretty upset. My boyfriend asked me to not go over there and say anything because it would make things extremely awkward and that he also suspected the neighbor could possibly be on the spectrum (again haven’t met the neighbor so have no judgment or say on that). But I have been sitting and thinking about this through the night and today, and I want to go and say something. I don't want to cause any drama, but merely address how inappropriate it was and to ask him to leave me and my boyfriend alone in the future.

  
If there is the possibility of them being on the spectrum I would hate to confront them if they aren't aware that it was inappropriate. But, I haven't even met the neighbors and they already pushed and crossed my boundaries.   
So Reddit, WIBTA if I confront my neighbor for asking my boyfriend to cheat on me for the opportunity of a male experience?

"AITA for being mad that my wife refuses to have kids but wants to be a surrogate? | We dated for 4 years and have been married for 2, I loved kids and have always wanted at least 2 or 3 and I have been very open about this with my wife. She's never been a fan of kids but she always painted it as her not being ready to have children and not wanting to go through pregnancy. Every discussion about kids we've had has been met with her always saying ""I'm just not ready yet"" and even suggestions about adopting have been met with the same reply. She's made it clear to me that whilst she wouldn't mind being a mother she's just not ready yet.

I recently had my 30th and I raised the discussion with her again, I don't want to leave it too late as ideally I'd like to still be somewhat young whilst my kids grow up as my own father was 55 was I when born. This led to a massive argument where she finally told me she doesn't want to be a mother, she doesn't want to ever have kids whether they are hers or adopted.

I was hurt but pulled back a bit and decided to give her some time to think about it. She then surprised me with news that some of our friends apparently having trouble getting pregnant and they approached her with the idea of her being a surrogate. She didn't discuss it with me or even tell me but just said she was going to go ahead with it and had the appointment booked to see if she's suitable. 

I feel like this is a slap in the face to me, she explained that she just doesn't want to be a mother and has no issue with being pregnant or giving birth she just doesn't want to have to raise a child. She's adamant about going through with this and even used the ""my body my rules"" argument to shut me out of the decision completely."
"AITA for putting my diet/workout before my good friend? | After living months in denial, one visit to the doctor's finally made me (16M) realise that I'm extremely underweight. Soon after accepting it, I became determined to gain a little more meat and I was 100% committed.

I completely changed my diet and after several months of eating the right foods, working out and all of that, I've gained 11 kilos and I've pretty much achieved what I I aimed for. I don't have a body of a supermodel stacked with muscles everywhere, but I am pretty fit to be called healthy now and I'm looking to maintain that this time. Especially since majority of the people I know has a boy/girlfriend at the moment and I don't.

During that time. I found out that I was hanging out less and less with my friends. Just yesterday, a good friend (17M) called and asked me if I wanted to go and hang out with the others for a bit since ""it's been a while"". I politely refused and told him that today was my workout day and I can come on a different day if he wanted me to.

He was silent for a bit, then said ""You're really putting too much stress on your body ever since you realised you're underweight, y'know. You work out 3-4 times a week, how about you relax for once?"" I never really had an answer for that. Our conversation turned quiet for a while before he told me that he'll be going soon and that I should reconsider.

I did miss out, and I got texts from friends later that night telling me how much I've missed out on and more texts saying that I value my diet too much. I woke up this morning feeling a little bad about that. AITA?"
"WIBTA if I refused to pay for my boyfriends alcohol anymore? | TLDR: I financially support boyfriend, I don’t want to support his drinking habit anymore. 

I 26F support my boyfriend 27M financially. He lives in a small town and there’s really only 4 places he could talk to, all of which he’s worked at and quit without notice. One of them has hinted that they need help to him, so I want him to go and apply/apologize and try to work there. He won’t. He says it’s pointless. 

I work ~70 hours a week. I’m trying to save money to buy a house. It’s becoming impossible for my to save much money at all and my savings is honestly dwindling. 

This has been going on for a year. I give him $100 a week (on Wednesday’s) plus pay his phone bill every month. He spends most of his money on cigarettes and booze. Occasionally coffees or food. Usually by Monday night or Tuesday morning he’s “broke”. But that’s tough shit, he gets money on Wednesday’s. I’ve set this rule for him. He should plan better and be more responsible. I would not care if he bought a pack of cigs, a $5 coffee and a $5 sandwich every single day. But I care that he’s wasting my money on drinking 6 days a week at least. As of today, the last time he didn’t drink was June 20th. 


Him moving in with me is not an option. Him working with me is not an option. I’ve offered to buy him a car and pay his Insirance/fees for it if he would get his license. He will not do it. 

I feel as if I’m offering him 1000x escapes but he will not take any initiative. I’m tired of my money going to his booze. WIBTA if I told him he’s not allowed to buy alcohol with the money I give him?"
"AITA for teaching my bro a lesson with alcohol? | Thraways, bro uses reddit

my brother (15M), has been begging me every time we go to a family social gathering for some alcohol, he begs and begs and begs. I always say no because hes underage.

He doesnt like talking with the kids at the fam meet ups, so hes either begging my mom to leave, or interrupts my conversations that im having

I was in the middle of an intense convo with my aunt about her recently deceased husband. My brother then rudely interrupts and is tugging on my shirt, “yo dude gimme some of that, yo yo yo dude” in the most annoying trying-to-look-cool way.

He went on and on nagging me, and i got so mad i took him aside and gave him the whiskey which was about 1/3 a glass full and told him to have it

He drank a sip and handed it back but i pushed it back towards him and told him to finish it

I made him drink the whole thing and his face was all red and he had to sit down. 

He ended up crying and we went home, everyone at the party who heard about it said i was an asshole, so did my parents.. idk he does this every fucking time at a party and it seems like this will definitely be the last time he asks me for alcohol, AITA?"
"AITA for getting a weekend job due to being sick and tired with babysitting younger siblings (on weekends) | From around 14.9 years to 22, I've spent virtually every weekend babysitting. As in, Saturdays, Sundays, 8ish AM to 11ish PM. From their infancy until now. Being cooped up on weekends I believe contributed to my social anxiety. Most weekends of my adolescence were pretty much about babysitting (and internet surfing/TV watching). 

I brought it up to my mom (who works weekends) and she's done nothing but talked about how it's normal for older siblings to watch younger siblings, how she did it as a kid, how her boss did it, etc. She would bring up examples of older siblings caring for younger siblings in an almost parental manner that I never did and never will have any interest in. It came to a point some weeks ago where she sarcastically said that since I didn't want to babysit as a teen, I should've gotten a job to replace the weekend job she used and supported the household and supported the household instead. (imagine a 15-year-old supporting two adults and the adults' kids).

So--eventually I got fed up. I grew increasingly resentful and am still resentful about wasting pieces of my adolescence babysitting. Then there was also a thing where her spouse was absolutely abusive to me, and she would deny, dismiss, and believe his dishonesty/attempts to kind of spoil my character to her. She's still with him and I don't care at this point.

I got a job recently. I'm supposed to be working weekends. Her response? I need to give her 40% of my check to cover household utilities (which she's not getting). She's pretty much indignant and actually feels like *I'm* oppressing *her* because me not wanting to be available to babysit *her* children interferes with her weekend job."
"AITA For not wanting to watch or spend time with my little brother? | So my little brother was a late unexpected birth. He is currently 8 and I am 24 so there is a 16 year difference, as a result I never got to bond with him, basically I lived at home till 18, so only saw him as an infant and as you can imagine a 16 year old guy has no interest in spending time with an infant.

I went off to college at 18, graduated  and now I got a good job live several hours away from my parents  and so forth.

Within those 6 years I went home a few times a year around holidays, but I never enjoyed it because there was always a crying toddler, every conversation was about my kid brother, where as I just wanted to have a good time, talk about college etc. Obviously I did not blame my kid brother for this but it did impact my relationship with my parents. In the past two or so years I only come to my parents home once a year and well here we are.

I am now at my parents with my girlfriend and they are trying to get me to bond with my brother, asking me to babysit him, asking me to take him out to places, asking me to play games with him, sending him to my room to wake me and my girlfriend up. Now I get their sentiment but I am not interested.

I do not know this kid, I do not dislike or hate him but I just have no connection with this kid, be barely knows who I am, I barely know who he is, it is just awkward to be honest.

I do not want to watch him, I have no interest in spending time with him, I am just here for my parents, but I am obviously not ignoring him either. Am I an asshole for not being interested in forcing a relationship? And even more would I be an asshole if I told my parents how I look at this situation?"
"AITA for telling my boyfriend he gave me a stye? | I woke up this morning with a stye on my lower eyelid for the first time in my life. It's really painful, and I've spent all morning on google trying to figure out how I got it, and what to do. 

My boyfriend and I often play fight, and find little ways to annoy each other. It's childish, but it makes us laugh. A couple of weeks ago he thought it would be funny to stick his tongue DIRECTLY INTO MY EYEBALL. It was gross, but at the time I laughed because it was just so unexpected.

Since then he's done it several more times, to increasingly hostile reactions.

I know styes are caused by staph bacteria, which is found in the nose and mouth, and I haven't changed any of my habits recently around washing my face or anything. To me it makes sense that he caused it. 

When I brought it up with him, he vehemently denied that could be the cause. First he said because that's not what causes them, then when I looked it up he changed and said it couldn't be him because I went out of town for a few days so he hasn't done it in a week. 

I'm obviously not a doctor but to me it makes sense that symptoms might take a while to develop. He got upset with me for even suggesting it, and said I was trying to blame my own poor hygiene on him (I wash my face and hands regularly, and I've never had this problem before). 

Regardless, I feel like it takes zero effort to just not lick your girlfriend's eyeball (not a sentence I ever thought I'd have to type), and if the positions were reversed I'd at least entertain the possibility that I had caused it and promise not to do it again. 

To me it seems like him not wanting to feel guilty is more important to him than my health, but am I overreacting?"
AITA for not taking a girls bikini pic down from my bar? | I found some vintage bikini model pics from the 70s and it fit really well in my bar. A few years later some dude approaches my bar and demands I take them down because that his mom. Apparently she was a playboy model and the family is trying to hide it. I told politely I’m not going to. He yells at me and demands so I told him to fuckoff. I’ve been getting emails and phone calls from others (I’m assuming sane family). At this point I’m doing this on principal not because I give a shit about the poster
WIBTA if I left fake love letters hidden away in the house I’m selling so the need owner would find them and become invested in this fake romance? | Would I be an asshole if I wrote a bunch of hauntingly romantic (I’m talking Edgar Allen Poe type shit) love letters and have them all back dated and hide them under the bathroom sink so whoever buys my house will find them and read them and become really invested in this fake romance soap opera type drama and then I would abruptly end the letters on some dramatic cliff hanger to leave the person is suspense for the rest of their life.
"AITA for telling my girlfriend that I would consider breaking up with her if she does plastic surgery ? | So we were randomly talking about plastic surgeries. I told her that I'm not a big fan of plastic surgeries because they are still risky and expensive and can put the people involved through a lot of stress. I told her that I think that in cases where people have physical impairments due to fire or some other accidents, it makes sense but if they are for cosmetic reasons, it may not be worth going through the knife. Obviously, I know people want to feel good about themselves and there are many who go through plastic surgeries for that reason.

&#x200B;

She said that she is also not a fan of plastic surgeries but she wouldn't break up just because her partner chose to have one. She said it just means that she doesn't love him enough if she did. Her point was that if they loved each other, they have to work out a compromise regardless. I told her that it is the right of the boyfriend to break up with the girlfriend if he is not comfortable with her having surgery done just like how it is the right of the girlfriend to do what she pleases with her body. I told her that they need to have a proper discussion first and make sure they both are good with the idea, otherwise the dynamics of the relationship changes and they wouldn't be happy going forward.

&#x200B;

At the end she asked me if I would break up with her if she had some surgery done. I knew the question was just rhetorical. I told her that I love her the way she is and I would first try to understand her point of view to as to why she wanted to get something done and if there was something I could do to change her mind. Then, if she still decided to go through with the surgery, depending on how extensive it is - for e.g. if it's a minor nose job, I wouldn't really care but if it's something like a butt implant or injecting herself with chemicals on her face or some part of her body, I would consider breaking up. She was shocked and kind of got mad at me.

&#x200B;

I was just being honest. AITA ?

&#x200B;

Edit : Thank you everyone. I appreciate all the tips provided here, will definitely keep those in mind for any future conversations. This morning, the topic came up again but it had a pleasant ending. She said she respected my opinions and there was no need for any bad feelings. She said that as long as we are there for each other and communicate our feelings and opinions to each other with mutual respect, she sees no reason why we couldn't talk honestly about topics like these. At the end, we both agreed that this was a silly discussion to have and moved on."
"WIBTA if I don't invite my Dad's GF to my wedding? | I (30M) have started planning my wedding and was recently talking to my Dad about the guest list. He didn't mention anything then but later texted me ""Can I bring \[GF\] to your wedding?""

The only issue for me is that my mum passed away a year ago and my Dad got with this new girl only a couple months later. My mum was sick for many years and my Dad stepped into a care taker role than a husband role so I understood his new relationship but I still personally struggle knowing he's moved on so quick and I can't help but see the GF as ""the other woman"".

My siblings and I haven't met the GF and we're not ready to anytime soon. I told my Dad I would think about it he said ""We'll speak in person tomorrow. It's very important to me she comes.""

So am I an asshole for not wanting her there/telling my Dad I need to think about it?

**EDIT**: Some people seem to think that I am not supportive of my Dad having a GF and I can see how you may have seen that with me referring to her as ""the other woman"", however as I said, I understood his relationship. I have been supportive of his happiness this whole time, I've actively asked how she is going and I don't shut the conversation down when she is brought up. But my father and I have had completely different experiences with my mother and our grieving process is reflective of that - I have only just lost my mother but my Dad lost his wife years ago. It is not an easy decision to just let the GF come when I'm still just accepting that my Mum won't be there.

UPDATE: I really appreciate all the constructive advice given on this thread. It has certainly put things into perspective, especially with what the experience will be like for my Dad if he doesn't have that support from someone on the wedding day. I will let him know we will invite her to the wedding but we will need to organise a time for the whole family to meet her beforehand. We do not want the introductions to take place on the day with myself and SO or any of my siblings and their partners.


FINAL UPDATE: Spoke to my Dad earlier today. I acknowledged that it may be important to have her there for him on the day and that we certainly aren't saying no but I just wanted January to pass first because it's the first anniversary of Mum's passing. He said he shouldn't have brought it up so soon, considering the wedding is still ages away. We will be inviting her, but will need to organise a dinner or something beforehand for the family to meet her."
"AITA for telling my buddy that his comedy is bad and he shouldn’t go on tour with his improv group? | I have posted my friends improv to cringe, so I’m going to do this on a throwaway account.

I (27m) have a friend (28m) that wants to be a comedian. He is really not funny. I’m sorry but he’s not. He joined an improv group and .they do shows at a local comedy club. I have gone to a couple. *maybe* 20 people show up to these shows, usually less. 

He’s really into this improv group, and they want to go “on tour”. Basically traveling to clubs in different states and performing. He won’t be getting paid for this, but he wants to quit his job and travel for exposure. 

When he came to talk to me about it I told him it was a bad idea. He has a girlfriend and a young kid at home, he can’t just up root them to chase a wild dream that isn’t going to happen. 

When he asked me why it wasn’t going to happen, I told him that he wasn’t very funny. It really upset him. 

He accused me of being a fake friend and trying to crush his dreams. He said that he was doing this for his girl and his kid so that they could have a better life. 

I told him that working an actual job would give them a better life. I’ve tried to apologize for my bluntness, but he won’t talk to me. 

My girlfriend says it wasn’t my place to tell him that his comedy was bad, but would be pissed if she was left with a child for this. Am I being an asshole and an unsupportive friend? I’m on the fence about it because I think he’s delusional."
"AITA for refusing to buy meat for my nonvegan friends? | Five friends and I are planning to make dinner together. Two of us are vegan, myself included, so the dinner will have a vegan option and a meat option.

I offered to buy all the ingredients we need and have my friends pay me back. However, I said I wouldn't buy the meat and that one of the nonvegans would need to get it separately.

I don't want to buy the meat for two reasons. The first is that I think eating meat is wrong and, while I don't try to control what they do, I won't actively facilitate it. The second is that I know I'd feel gross after buying meat because I haven't handled it for so long.

One of the nonvegans think this is ""crazy"". He says that generally I'm reasonable about being vegan but can't understand why I won't buy meat for others to eat.

AITA?

Edit for clarity: I never committed to buying the meat. When I offered to get the ingredients, I was upfront that I wouldn't buy the meat."
"AITA for snapping when someone said my cooking looks disgusting? | I live with my room mate and boyfriend, and we all contribute to the groceries for food. Room mate walks in to me cooking the filling for a pie for us three and said it looks disgusting. I snapped at told him ""What the hell *name*, you wouldn't say that to someone's cooking. I'm the one cooking it"". He said it was a joke and sort of slipped out.

Am I right to still be a bit mad at his *joke*? "
"META: Too many AITA commenters advocate too quickly for people to leave their partners at the first sign of conflict, and this kind of thinking deprives many people of emotional growth. | I’ve become frustrated with how quick a lot of AITA commenters are to encourage OP’s to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. While leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. 

When we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for Love, Empathy, Understanding, and Communication. These capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. 

Encouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our “throw-away” consumer society. I often get a feeling that many commenters don’t have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. 

Please think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts. "
"WIBTA if I told my depressed friend that the world doesn’t revolve around her? | So I have a friend who just got out of a 7-month relationship with a guy who’s started going to college and wants time to focus on himself. She immediately became depressed, understandably, but now she’s refusing to accept the fact (not even two weeks have passed) that it’s a possibility in the universe to be single. She keeps complaining about how she wants dick, and is at my feet BEGGING me to find her a guy. She won’t talk about anything else. When I pointed out that many people stay single for months after a breakup, she told me she doesn’t deserve to be single. In class, another friend started a story by saying “so there was this guy...” and was cut short by this bitch saying “damn can’t relate” like it’s pissing me off. She’s trying to make everything about her, and can’t stand that things won’t always go her way. I’m her best, and one of her only friends, and I don’t want to ruin that over something stupid and petty, so WIBTA if I told her that she’s being an annoying bitch? Please feel free to be honest, because if it would make me the asshole, I don’t want to do it.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the responses. She has actually been getting less annoying so far and unless she backtracks, it should be fine. If she does then it seems the general consensus is to tell her nicely. Sugarcoat it but be direct. Thanks guys! A couple of clarifications: No tinder because we’re juniors in HS, and the thing that caused me to use the strong language of “annoying bitch” was that she said “I don’t deserve to be single” and other entitled things like that which upsets me because all of her friends including myself have been single for at least a year and she never cared. Again, thanks to everyone for the advice!"
"AITA for not wanting my roommates Mom staying in my room | So I've been sharing a house with a guy for a few years and we get on pretty well, sometimes a few niggles but all ok. One thing I've found is that they can be tight with money, even though they have a good job etc. 
Anyway I'm away this weekend and he's asked if his mom can stay in my room, while his dad stays in his room with him (there's a single bed in that room).
Initially I refused, but then I agreed because I felt bad that I would be away and he kind of guilted me into it.

The whole thing just doesn't sit right with me and I feel like he never should have asked because he knew I'd say yes, and especially when they could afford a hotel instead. I know he'll change the sheets and keep the room tidy etc.

Am I the asshole for be annoyed with him for this?"
"AITA for asking my boyfriend to return my Valentine's day gift? | We've been dating and living together for two years, both in our 20s. We exchanged our gifts last night and he gave me an expensive perfume. It wasn't my favorite smell but I didn't think it smelled awful either. I don't have any other perfumes so it's actually a very nice gesture. I know he spent a long time picking it out. I said thank you/showed my gratefulness last night.

Today (Valentine's) I went to work and overheard three coworkers saying that my perfume smelled awful. This made me feel really bad and made me not want to ever wear it again. I don't want people I meet/network with to think I smell awful as a first impression. I told my boyfriend what happened and he got very upset with me, saying I shouldn't care about their opinions because if I like his gift I should just wear it. I feel really bad for asking him to return it. I just figure we could use the money if I'm not going to wear it.

Am I the asshole?

*Just to clarify*: I told him to return it so he could have the money, not me.

EDIT 2: People keep asking this, I put two small sprays. Not very much at all. They said it while I was passing by. 

EDIT 3: My bf and I have talked things out, we're going to the store tomorrow to return and pick out something new. Thanks for the responses everyone!"
"AITA for accidentally triggering my gfs fear of abandonment? | I live in my girlfriend's house, love her dearly, and we've been in a relationship for five years. The one thing that makes it hard sometimes is the fact that she has BPD. She was emotionally abused and abruptly left by her father at age 12. (The emotional abuse started when she was about 7 or 8). We were playing Brawlhalla together and I told her she needed to work on her recovery skills, to which she told me that it was ""kinda my fault"" because I ""tried"" to show her the right buttons to recover better and they weren't working.  I was annoyed because it sounded like she was using me as a scapegoat for her poor gameplay.  The buttons I showed her were the right ones, she was just using them wrong.  I expressed that she made me upset by basically calling me a bad teacher in regards to the game instead of just admitting that she needs to work on her skills a bit and she just dismissed me and said ""Oh come on you're too sensitive, I said the buttons weren't working.""  I got angrier at that comment because she dismissed how I felt and started making me feel like I was coming at her unprovoked.  I just said ""Ok thanks for caring"" and she scoffed at me saying ""Holy shit dude it's just a game chill out."" I got up and said that I was going to hang out with my buddy because she was just making me angrier with everything she said.  All of a sudden she panicked and started crying.  I went to grab my shoes because I don't feed into her breakdowns but she grabbed one of them and wouldn't let go, eventually throwing the one she had down the hall and then taking the other one when I tried to get it.  She eventually dropped it but then grabbed my hands profusely crying and telling me to stay and spend time with her and that she was sorry for the fight.  I told her she needed to calm down and that she was acting like I was leaving her.  She started hitting herself in the head repeatedly and she kept saying ""what if you don't come back it'll be all my fault"" over and over and over again.  I told her that I just needed time away because she was taking everything too personally and nothing I say is gonna help.  She just said ""Staying here will help me please we need to talk this out now and I'm not letting you leave until we solve this.""  I told her that I loved her and that I wasn't leaving her and eventually she let me go, but she called me twice during the night to ""check in."" I know she can be irrational sometimes but I do feel like I could've tried harder not to trigger her fear of abandonment.  AITA?"
"AITA for getting upset that I received a Christmas ornament at a family gift swap? | So every year that I’ve been with my wife her family will draw names on thanksgiving and we do a gift swap that way. You spend $25 and get the person who you drew a gift. Easy peasy...



Normally I wind up with a gift card, which I’m always happy with. The past 2 years I got a gift card for a bookstore which was actually really fun. 




Well this year rolls around and we open our gifts yesterday. I get a bag, which weighs next to nothing, and assume there’s a gift card inside. I pull out the paper and find a thin wooden disk with my wife’s name and mine burned into it.


My in brother-in-law’s wife, who drew my name, says to me when I open it “it’s more for your wife than you.” 




I didn’t say anything ugly, I thanked them and all that, but my wife and I talked about it, and she agreed that it was a shitty gift. It’s especially confusing because the same person drew me last year and did fine. 



BTW if this ornament was $25 then she got ripped off big time. I may not care about ornaments whatsoever, but even if you’re the kind of person who does it doesn’t look like it’s worth that much."
"AITA for wanting my boyfriend to see Hamilton with me? | The title, but let me explain. I'm a young widow. My husband passed at the age of 32 and it was sudden and terrible but I don't want to get into that now.

When I finally started dating again I wasn't really dating, just trying to meet guys on Tinder to make the lonely nights pass. As it happens I actually met a great guy who I'm with to this day, almost 2 years later.

When we first met each other I was drinking a lot and didn't care about how I came across to people. I would play music from Hamilton a lot, and it's because that was our musical. He was Alexander Hamilton and I was his Eliza. I know I told my boyfriend this and I know he probably held me while I sang these songs and cried.

But now I'm better, our relationship is great and I'm looking forward to the future, something I never expected. Yet one of my greatest hopes has been to see Hamilton onstage. My late husband and I always wanted to see it together -- he said once ""It doesn't matter what we have to sell or do to see it, we'll see it.""

Obviously that never happened. But I still desperately want to see it. And my boyfriend does not.

He doesn't like to listen to the songs. He hates Lin Manuel-Miranda. He rolls his eyes whenever I wear one of my Hamilton shirts.

I understand he's tying this to my late husband but when I see it (and make no mistake, I WILL see it) I want to see it with my boyfriend. Not as a replacement for my husband, but because he's the love in my life and it's important to me and I want to experience that WITH HIM.

I know he'll go if I ask but I think he'll hate it the whole time. So if I want him to go, AITA? Should I just go alone?"
"AITA for calling my brothers girlfriend ""miss piggy"" for eating our food after we told her not too? | So last year my brother moved in with me and my roommate. When he moved in his girlfriend started spending a lot of time at our place. This isn't a problem as my roommates girl friend comes over too. Here's the thing though. My brothers gf pretty much eats all our food. No matter who's it it she will eat it. Me and roommate have told her multiple times to stop eating the food we buy and only eat the food brother buys but she ignores us and eats our food anyway.

&#x200B;

We have confronted her and my brother multiple times and told them she needs to stop but she just says ""tee hee, sorry but it's so good"" and he refuses to say anything about it. We both have tried to talk him into going to her house insted of bringing her over but he doesn't want too. It's gotten to the point where both of us are considering getting a second fridge to put a lock on. 

&#x200B;

Well, we're both sick of it. Brothers gf is a heavy girl and weight is a very touchy issue with her. Well, recently both of us have taken to calling her miss piggy when she eats our food. If we ever see her eating our food or after she has we confront her and call her it. She hates it and has freaks out each time she hears us refer to her as it. Honestly though, she still eats our food and so we kept doing it. 

&#x200B;

Well, today when I got home from work his gf was there eating leftovers I had cooked last night. I told her ""Wow, I love to come home to see miss piggy eating my leftovers that I was looking forward too."" before I started oinking at her. She broke down crying and ran out.  She's been calling my brother furiously since and is refusing to come here anymore because i'm an ""asshole"".

&#x200B;

Am i? Like, we asked her so much to stop and she didn't that i honestly just lost it. We all buy our own food and we have a rule never to touch each others stuff. She knows this and she still did it so I think she deserved it."
"AITA for changing the WiFi password? | I live in a multifamily home. My family has wifi and we pay $80 a month for it. Apparently, the other floors have been using it because the password was so easy to guess or something.

The wifi router box is located in one of the tenant's living room because of logistic reasons.

I didn't want anyone else to be using it so I changed the password. 

One of the tenants comes and knocks and asks why the wifi isn't working and my brother tells them that we have changed the password because the wifi is only for our family. 

The tenant proceeds to plug out the router so that the wifi gets shut off. I knock on their door and ask them if the router is plugged in. They say they'll go ""check"" but I don't think they did because they don't come back for some time so I knock again and they say with an attitude "" Don't knock on my door. Don't knock on my door. Leave a note in the mailbox if you need to contact me.""

Now there is no wifi. They were not paying for the wifi and it is not included in their rent. In my opinion, they are being really petty.

AITA?"
"AITA for making my daughter remove her nose piercing, even after I said it was fine? | My daughter (16) surprised me last week with a nose piercing. I was shocked when I saw it and I told her to take it out, but she kept arguing about how it was so small and she should be able to keep it in. We were going at it for a while, and then her dad broke us up, sending her to her room. After calming down, I went to talk to her again, and I realized I could barely see the piercing, so I said it was fine for her to keep it.

&#x200B;

Well, today, I came across her fake ID in her room. I wasn't snooping; I was putting her clean laundry away. She's been busted before for smoking and drinking, and now I know how she got cigarettes and alcohol, so I approached her about it, and she begged me not to ground her because, according to her, she wasn't using the fake ID for cigarettes and alcohol, she ""only used it for the nose piercing."" Well, after hearing that, it suddenly made sense, she's underage, she shouldn't have been allowed to get a nose piercing without a parent's permission, and I got upset about her piercing all over again and made her take it out. She was upset about it, claiming that I couldn't do that since I already gave her permission to have it, but I was very reluctant to give her permission, and that was before I knew she used a fake ID to get it. I basically told her that either she takes it out or I take it out, and she finally took it out.

&#x200B;

She's been giving me the silent treatment ever since, and my husband thinks I was being petty, but I feel like if I let her keep her piercing, I'd be condoning her breaking the law. AITA?"
"AITA for throwing away someone’s wedding invitation that wasn’t addressed to me? | So my parents are wealthy, much better off than their siblings and it’s kind of a joke in the family “give the bill to Tony” (my father) when they go out to eat, etc. Its not really serious but it gets mentioned to bust their balls.

So there is a friend of my cousin whom I hang out with when I go visit them a few states over, John, who is getting married soon. We go to hockey games when in season and hit the bars together, not a great friend but when I’m in town I always see him. I was talking with John and his soon to be wife at a family barbecue about the wedding. They talked about how it was going to be small and intimate with just very close people, kinda nicely eluding that I wasn’t going to be invited, which is completely fine. 

The couple has never meet my parents so when my uncle cracked a joke about my mother and fathers income my cousin explained the ongoing joke to them and how they are generous John kinda chuckled and nothing was said about it for the rest of the trip. 

So about a month after that trip I checked the mail (I still live with my parents as I finish grad school) and there is an RSVP and wedding registry thing to Johns wedding. I opened it assuming it was for me but it invited my parents only. I was pretty shocked and hurt to not be invited after knowing this guy for like 5 years but my parents who they meet once for 5 minutes were? So I just chucked the invite into the trash. I feel kinda guilty about it. AITA?"
"AITA for cancelling a meetup with my boyfriend and then refusing to return his things the next day. | So I (M23) have been dating this guy (M27) for about 6 months, I'm really committed to him as this is the first serious relationship I have ever been in. Around 3 days ago, I and a few of my classmates decided to go grab lunch at a shopping complex a few minutes away from school. This complex is very close to where my boyfriend goes to school, so naturally I texted him and told him that we would be having lunch near his school and he's welcome to join us. He responded in the affirmative, this was at around 1:15 pm. We get lunch and start eating and at around 1:40, I realise that it's getting late, so I text him telling him that I have to be back in class at around 2:00 pm. He responds, ""OK"". We continue eating and at around 2:00 pm I call him and tell him that are leaving, he responds with a casual ""OK"". So I go on my merry-way back to class. That evening as I'm texting him I notice that he's being very blunt and snippy. This continues up to the next morning. The next day we meet a friend, and he's (the bf) is acting normal, but I can tell something's still wrong, although I have no clue what it is. Anyway at some point in the night I force it out of him and he tells me that he had come all the way to the cafe only to get a call when he arrived that we had left. He says that he is extremely pissed off. I admit that I know this is a touchy area for him as he really doesn't like his ""time being wasted"" but still, AITA here?

But wait, there's more. As the night goes on he keeps taking silent but hurtful jabs at me in conversation. However I tolerate this, as I know that when he's mad his mouth grows a mind of its own and he ""can't remember"" all that he said after he's cooled down. I was willing to let this all slide until he asked me to drive him to get his new bike from the mechanic. I was a bit apprehensive to do so as I was driving my dad's car and wanted to conserve fuel, but I agreed to it because I love him. As we leave I ask for the directions. Getting to the mechanics’ is fairly simple however I am not great at directions. That said, and him being aware of this, everytime I ask him for directions I get a bunch of snide comments questioning my intelligence and it gets pretty hurtful. This day was no different unfortunately and I was seething by the time we finally arrived. He then asks me to drive behind him all the way back to his house as he's not confident on the road, I tell him that this was not part of the plan but he insists. I angrily go along with it knowing that I've more than doubled my journey home because he looks extremely unstable on the bike. When I get home he calls to tell me that I have a lot of his stuff in my car, like his phone charger and laptop which he needs for school. He asks how he's going to get them back and I tell him that he'll get them when he gets them (I'll send them tomorrow). He then asks me why I'm pissed off and I tell him it's nothing and hang up the phone. So yet again I ask you, AITA?"
"AITA for telling a student to quit complaining about an A | I've been a High School English III teacher for a few years and haven't had any problems until this year. I have my classes do a project called Poetry Out Loud right before the holiday break. The whole thing is about memorizing a poem with 30+ lines and reciting it with emotion after around two months of preparation. This is done to help them with public speaking. So during one of my classes, three girls all recited the same poem. They all did great, but one of them didn't fill the room with her voice. The final scores were 98%, 98%, and 93%. After entering their scores in my online grade book, the girl with the lower score came to me and asked why she got a lower score. I explained to her that her voice wasn't commanding and didn't fill the room. That apparently wasn't good enough of an answer and she kept pushing. I told her that she got an A so she shouldn't be complaining. She then proceeded to cry and run out of my class (this was during the lunch break, so she wasn't being disruptive). Was I the asshole, or was the girl overdramatic?"
"AITA for being super jealous that my sister is getting engaged? | I'm F26, she is F23. Both of us started dating our respective boyfriends 5 years ago. She is adamantly childfree, I desperately want kids. This is relevant. 

Her boyfriend is proposing tonight. I've seen the ring, sneaky took her to get a manicure ""oh look I got a Groupon for two let's do it!"", etc. And I'm so, so happy for her. He's a great guy and treats her super well. 

But I'm also jealous. A lot. My boyfriend and I were long distance for 3 years of our relationship before we closed the distance. I love him so, so much. And I want to marry him, have a family, etc. He says he wants it too, but he just hasn't asked me yet. There are reasons, partially logistical partially financial. But I want kids. I want a family. And I won't do it until I'm married. 

And I guess I'm jealous. My sister is getting engaged (and they're most likely doing a quickie elopement for personal reasons I won't go into). She's younger than me, doesn't want kids, which is FINE I want her to be happy and if she doesn't want kids, don't have kids. 

But at the same time I do want kids. I do want to get married, like yesterday. And I'm getting older and already have medical issues that may cause fertility problems, so I want to get started on that asap. So I have this horrible pang of jealousy with the whole thing. 

Does this make me a massive asshole? 

EDIT- it’s not really an option for me to just propose to him, so yeah. "
"AITA for spending my girlfriend's ""birthday money""? | To clarify, I did not spend it in the sense that I wasn't paying her back. A kid knocked on our door a few days ago asking to do lawn work, I told him come back and I'd give him $20. My girlfriend has $40 that has been sitting on our table for two months, which she was given by her dad on her birthday. I didn't have my own cash on me, so I grabbed my girlfriend's 20 and gave it to the kid. When she got home, I told her I had to use her 20, but I would be sending her cash right now for it. She then threw a fit, because that was her ""birthday money"" and me sending her cash is not the same. We are now in a fight and I'm being told I need to get cash from an ATM to replace it. Am I the asshole for using cash my girlfriend deemed as ""birthday money"" even though I'm paying her right back for it?"
"AITA for giving my honest opinion to my friend's wedding caking idea? | Long-time lurker and first-time poster. I had to make an account.  


This happened earlier today. I (m25) was hanging out with a friend (f24). We were in her dorm room and just taking and scrolling through our phones when the topic of weddings came up. I have no interest in weddings, but she was really excited. She then goes on to the topic of what she'd want her cake to look like. The conversation is as followed.  


F: I already know what I'd want my cake to look like. Maybe I'll have you make it.  
Me: Oh? Care to show me? (I'm actually a baker and am in school for it and she has seen some of the cakes I've made in classes.)  
F: This! \*shows me a picture on her phone\*  
Me: Ah.

She had noticed a bit of disinterest in my voice when I saw the cake and asked what wrong. I proceed to tell her that I'm nothing really into naked cakes. For those that don't know naked cakes are cakes with little to no icing on the outside of them with little garnish. They begun a popular wedding trend. Example: [https://www.brides.com/gallery/naked-wedding-cakes-no-icing](https://www.brides.com/gallery/naked-wedding-cakes-no-icing)  She asked me why and in response I asked could I be completely honest with her. She nodds and says sure. I say word for word ""They just look bad to me. The cakes look unfinished as if someone stopped at the crump coat with no border and just fruits or live flowers just placed on it. I honestly can see myself making something like that because I personally would feel proud of it.

At this point she's visibly upset, not raging mad, but you can tell she's hurt. We talk for a bit more before I left and that's it for now. But I started thinking was I an asshole for expressing my opinion. She's not planning over getting married anytime soon, but I felt I killed her joy about her cake idea."

she got the tattoo and was in love with it until someone pointed out what it said, she is now mad that nobody stopped her from getting it. someone then decided that because I'm from Japan I should of told her what it ment. so I'm now the asshole of art class for the time being .

"AITA for calling my GF's friend fat | I (20M) have struggled with my weight for a majority of my life, so I would never insult somebodies weight or appearance randomly. I've been dating my current gf (21f) for over a year and at the start of the relationship I was overweight, but now I've gotten into the best shape of my life. I'm not saying I'm super muscular or anything, but I'm definitely proud of the progress I've made. 

One of my gf's close friends has always made snide comments about my looks or what I wear since I met her. It's very strange and random because a good part of the time she's quite normal, but then randomly throws an insult at me. Because of this my gf has limited her contact with this friend, I had no part in this decision and it was 100% my gf's choice. 

Recently my gf's friend group hungout with current SO's and friends of friends, and my gf's friend was there. I didn't mind this because I hadn't seen her in almost 2 months and maybe she wouldn't be rude to me. As we were hanging out the friend made two comments about me, the first being how I looked super pale like a vampire/hermit, and also about my clothes being too big for me(she knows I lost a lot of weight). After insulting my clothes she said ""If I knew any better I'd think you were homeless"", in which I responded ""If I didn't know any better I'd call you a fatass"". This friend is on the ""bigger"" side of the scale so she became super angry at me and yelling. 

Multiple friends in the group said I was out of line, but I think it was warranted and well deserved for her being so rude to me. Looking back at it, I probably should have just ignored it, but she rubbed me the wrong way with her last insult. As an ex-overweight person I know how painful somebody insulting your weight can be, but I think she deserved it

TL;DR: Gf's friend has always been rude to me and insulted me multiple times at a group hangout, I responded by calling her fat"
"AITA for refusing to help my 9 year old with her poem recitation? | My oldest daughter has quarterly poem recitations every quarter for school since Kindergarten. And Every. Single. Quarter. For the last 16 (ish) quarters I battle with her to memorize these stupid poems. We try to start memorizing at least a couple weeks before it’s due, but regardless the night before it’s due she’s pissed off that I’m making her recite it back to me with the proper eye contact and posture that the school requires. It’s so frustrating for me and for her. We’ve both thrown our share of temper tantrums... I hate these poems. 

Anyways. This quarter, I had enough. She’s in third grade, this is her millionth poem. She knows the drill by now. I told her she’s in charge of memorizing this poem by the due date. I’ll run the lines with her if she needs it, but I’m leaving it up to her to manage her time properly and memorize this one. Cut to tonight, the night before it’s due, and she’s been crying for the last two hours because she waited until the last minute to memorize everything and doesn’t want to do it now. She. Won’t. Stop. Crying. It’s BEYOND dramatic. I’ve offered to help her run lines and she shuts down and stops trying. So now, I’m just not offering to help at all. My husband says I’m being a jerk and even though he’s never home to witness the poem drama or help with it, it should be my responsibility to help her since she’s only 9... AITA here?!

Edit: 
My husband usually doesn’t help with homework stuff because of his work schedule. He works second shift and usually isn’t home until 10ish 

Also, this is 100% an issue of WILL not SKILL. My 9 year old is ENTIRELY capable of memorizing these on her own. She’s very bright. She’s never had a problem with actually memorizing once we get over the hurtle of her just really not wanting to do the work. To give you an example, when I had my second daughter I completely forgot about the poem being due while I was delivering in the hospital. My oldest went to school, hadn’t looked at the poem once, asked to go last and recited the poem word for word perfectly after just hearing her ten classmates recite it first (this was 1st grade so the poems were a lot easier, but STILL). This is the reason I am at my breaking point. 

I’ve given her different memorizing techniques, I have her a suggested schedule for what parts she should memorize and by when, I broke the poem into parts for her. I gave her tools and, again, this is her 16 ish poem. Not her first. This is a common academic expectation by now. She chose to ignore my advice, wait until tonight and she’s throwing her temper tantrum about having to do the work on it now, I’m just not participating in the drama. If she wants a good grade, memorize dude.

Update: well, this was an interesting experience. Thanks for everyone who commented. I forget how harsh and condescending people can be about the most trivial matters. I appreciate those that took the time to actually understand, ask questions and truly judge the situation rather than make judgmental and rash assumptions. I did end up standing my ground. She asked me to recite with her after she practiced which I gladly did. Got her grade back today: 98% - looks like I’m not too big of an asshole :) a lot of you need to give 9 year olds more credit!"
"AITA for getting angry when GF is always stays late at work | First of all, I love my girlfriend a lot and we are planning to get married soon. Her job starts at 9:00 and finishes at 18:00. However, she stays additional 2 to 3 hours at her work, meaning she will come home at 20:00 or 21:00. Eventhough, I know that she is not cheating on me, I just get grumpy when she stays late at work. Plus, even if she stays late the company will not pay her bonus salary. I always keep telling her to balance her work to life ratio, but she insists that if she doesn't stay late she will have more work later and says that she loves her work *(I don't think it is true).*"
"AITA for refusing to attend my boyfriend’s church concert? | In a nutshell, my boyfriend of three years (16M) is performing at an orchestra he’s worked hard on at his local church. He invited me (17F) to the event tomorrow morning but I declined.

For him, God the most important part of his life and it’s what brings him consistent relief amidst his awful family. He believes in putting me before himself because he holds less boundaries and will do anything for me. He wants me to eventually accept God because he thinks it will help me. Due to a lot of family-related incidents he’s developed strong anxiety about being abandoned, not being a priority, and sinking effort into something futile.

I have been an atheist for my whole life. Family conflicts resulted in strong anxiety about preaching and church functions and the like. I have attended some bible studies with him but that sense of discomfort never fades. I have avoidant tendencies and am very aware of where his needs and my needs meet. I have had more boundaries than him for a loooong time.

My reason for denying was that I was certain I would not feel comfortable a) around his uber-religious family, b) in a place I was unfamiliar with, and c) I definitely won’t feel comfortable in the long sermon following the short concert. His counter was that I need to think about him more and that he constantly puts me over himself (which he does) so I should be doing the same. I responded by asserting that he needs to care for himself more and recognize my long-established boundaries, and he replied by arguing that he is the only one willing to change and go out of one’s comfort zone to support the other.

EDIT: (for clarification) during the event I would have to sit with his family. I am a very bad liar and their judgmental would make it difficult to slip away after the concert part

**UPDATE:** I bucked up and went. His concert was at the very beginning and he came down to sit with me after. We avoided his family. He played really well and retroactively I’m glad I went. My bottled up anxiety started spilling over during the sermon so he walked me to my car. He had no harsh feelings and was glad I came. Thank you guys for helping me process this. :)"
"AITA for ransoming a girl's teddy bear? | There was this girl who kinda was friends with my roommate and I in uni. While I was away (according to my roommate) she knocked and he opened the door and she walked in without an invitation. I happened to accidentally leave my wallet on my desk. She reportedly rifled through it, took money, and left. Indeed, there was no money in my wallet when I returned. I walked to her dorm on the next floor, gained access via her roommate, and took some random stuffed animal. I left a vague note that didn't mention my identity but essentially just said, ""ROOMMATE told me you took my money. you know who i am and will receive your animal back when you return my money"" In-person she blamed the theft on my roommate. He'd been trustworthy the entire time we lived together, and so i believed his story. she never returned the money, rumor has it she just used it to buy another stuffed animal because she needs one to sleep at night due to some mental condition i was not aware of at the time"
"AITA for buying my bratty nephew store brand mac and cheese | My 9 year old nephew eats Kraft dinner constantly and its disgusting but my sister doesn't see anything wrong with it and since I was yelled at last time for simply bringing up he should be eating healthier food I shut my trap about it. Recently I was on my way over one day when she called me and asked if I could buy a box to bring since they're out. Whatever its only a buck so I stopped at walmart when I saw the Great Value brand and bought it instead because what's the difference? Well when he saw the box he threw an absolute tantrum screaming about how its ""not the same"". My sister punished him for it but yelled at me for ""buying the wrong one"" and I told her to buy that garbage her damn self next time. Later at dinner the Great Value mac and cheese was made for nephew and at one bite he started screaming how it ""doesnt taste right"" and my sister demanded I go and get the right kind. So I said I would, left and didnt come back. This morning I woke up to 20 texts about how Im a heartless asshole and how ""hes just a child"" and other bullshit over mac and cheese, but now Im wondering if I should have just got the kraft junk to spare a headache"
"AITA for not kicking a work friend out of my life because my wife doesn't like him. | The title pretty much sums it up, but I'm going to give you some background into how this problem even became a problem. My wife hates men. Like genuinely hates men. I, however, get along with men way more than woman because they are less catty. We both work at the same big grocery store company, but different departments. She is friends with everyone in her department (which is larger than mine), and I have made friends in other departments that occasionally come out and chat for a few minutes before getting back to work. 

This one particular dude that comes in and chats, my wife can't stand, because she feels he ignores her when she's in the room and only talks to me. She didnt express this to me until a few days ago, which once I was informed I pulled dude aside and pretty much was like ""Hey my wife feels that you ignore her and only talk to me which is making her uncomfortable"". He apologized and explained that it wasn't anything malicious and he's married (which I knew and didn't think any of our interactions were overstepping boundaries). He pretty much just said that he's intimidated by her and didn't know how to approach her, that's why he didn't say much to her, but he promised to make an effort to get to know her as well so she wouldn't be uncomfortable anymore. 

That brings us to today, where she came in on her break as he was in my part of the store telling me of this promotion they just offered him. He greeted her the same way he does me everyday and asked about the new car I told him we were picking up today for her. She completely ignores him, and storms out of the area. She waited until he left to come back in and ask if I was mad at her. I responded that yes I was mad because that was completely rude and I shouldn't be expected to drop every friend that she dislikes. ESPECIALLY AFTER I CORRECTED THE PROBLEM AND FOUND OUT IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE. 

Am I the asshole for being mad at her for how she acted toward a friend of mine?"
"AITA for being rude to my S.O.’s mother? | 


I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 2 years now. We are both twenty (and I’m a female). Everything was pretty great before this incident. My family liked him. But oh boy his family completely loved me. I’ve been on family hikes with them, have participated at family board nights, have done face masks with the mom and sister, baked with them, even prepared desserts at my house and brought it to them. 

The mom is a bit of a gossiper and she has gossiped about me and my family preciously. I don’t want to go into details, for they’re not relevant to this story. But some of the things she have gossiped about was hurtful. As someone who hates confrontations, I just ignored them

Christmas Eve party. She gives me twenty bucks to play poker with my bf’s uncle and some cousins. We play. Have fun. I end up winning 100 bucks. 

I don’t offer to repay her. I know to some people this is an asshole move. Simply put, in my family it wouldn’t be asshole move to not offer the money back. So I just assumed that not offering the money back won’t be perceived as rude. 

Christmas. I get a text from my boyfriend saying his mom is gossiping about me with her sisters and nieces.  The mom talked about how rude it was that I didn’t pay her back. A niece said it was completely rude how I even kept the money. “The money was meant for family, so it should stay in the family,” she said. Another niece commented on how weird it was that I don’t wear make up or jewelry. 

I was shocked. I felt like they were tearing me down now. I felt really hurt. 

The next day I asked the mom if I lost the poker game, if she would expect me to pay her back. She said I don’t know. I took this answer, then gave her twenty bucks. I then gave her the 80 remaining bucks. “Give this to the niece who was so concerned the money must stay in the family,” I say. “If she doesn’t want it, give it to someone in the family. If no one in the family wants it, then throw it away because i don’t want it.”

I then left.  Later that day, my bf tells me the mom became completely infuriated. She demanded that I apologize for being rude to her. I told her I won’t apologize, for I was rightfully angry. 

Today My bf and I, together, went to her house to apologize. She wasn’t home, but the husband was. We then left, and we planned to come back later so I could apologize. 

A few hours later, my S.O. gets a call from his mom. He answers, and the mom is mad. She just got home and her husband told her I came in looking for her. She told my bf that she doesn’t want me in the house at all. He then said I came to apologize and when I realized she wasn’t home i left. She said she wanted to speak to my bf before I even try to come into her house. 

Who is the prick here? Me? Her? How do I move forward?"
"AITA for telling my parents that they need to start think about the enviroment if they want grandkids? | So, right of the bat, I am well convinced that the climate is changing for the worse. I believe that my relative flat country will suffer along the coastlines, climate refugees will be come a huge issues and we will likely suffer ressource-wise. Basically, a light apocalypse.

My parents having the age that they have, 52 and 60, will likely never experience these consequences. I being 25, most likely will and any child I put into the world. They merely shrug and keep on traveling (6 times a year by plane), refuse to recycle and talking about getting another car.

With that gruesome intro over, let's get to the recent argument. My mom and dad has announced that, they are now ready for grandchildren and they keep dropping hints, that I should ""go make one"". I'm single and not really in a place to raise a child (still working on my education). On top of that, I have aforementioned view on impending disaster. So when I told them, that they shouldn't get their hopes up, they called me selfish.

I told them I could consider it in the future if I saw them show some more enviromental care, but then things escalated. I am right now being accused of blackmailing my parents into the climate agenda.

When all it comes down to is: I wont feel comfortable putting children into such a world and I'm not ready for children anyway. And even if I was, I would like to see said childs parents take an interest in leaving a better world for a grandchild. 

AITA?

EDIT: I do want to have kids, I am not baiting my parents into thinking it."
"AITA for not wanting my husband to wake me up to say goodbye? | There are many issues in our relationship because of my problems around sleep. I have a difficult time falling asleep, being woken up easily, and getting back to sleep if I'm woken up. My husband snores loudly. We've tried many times to sleep together and while I could deal with it for a little while, it really started to wear on me to not be able to sleep through the night. He also disliked being woken up to be told he was snoring. Not to mention sleeping and waking up at different times.

So more recently he's mentioned not waking me up because I have a bad attitude in the morning. This is true. I'm not a morning person and I'm not very nice. We've been doing pretty well lately and spending lots of time together for obvious reasons. I guess this made him think it would be nice to wake me up to say goodbye before going to work this morning. I was pretty pissed about it because I had woken up extremely early and was trying to get back to sleep so I wouldn't be so tired during work. Him coming in threw that out the window. In his defense he seemed to think I may have been oversleeping because he let me know the time.

I told him why I was still sleeping so if he could not do this again. He responded with ""If you ever wonder why I don't come to your room this is why"". He said anytime he comes I have an attitude and it hurts his feelings. I don't expect him to know when I have meetings or when I had problems sleeping. To me, it's just simpler to not say goodbye. It's not a big deal and avoids any issues of my schedule. But this hurts his feelings. AITA?"
"AITA for telling a girl that I’m not attracted to her beacause of her appearance? | Yesterday, I (24M) attended a party. There were many of my old friends there. One of the girls, 25?, was someone who I was close to growing up but lost contact with after.

The two of us reconnected and talked. She was drinking a bit, although I didn’t. Later on, she was doing things like putting her arm around me, holding my hand, etc, which I stopped because I have a girlfriend and I told her so.

Then, she asked, “If you weren’t taken, I bet we’d be together right now.” It was a bold thing for her to say and I guess it must have been the alcohol talking. I just responded, “Nah don’t think so.” She was offended and asked me why. I just said “you’re not my type”. She asked me WHY she wasn’t my type, and I was tired of her bugging me, so I said, “You’re just not what I’m attracted to.”

She got mad at me. She said, “Oh I get it, you’re attracted to coked up skeletons like your girlfriend.” Referring to the fact that my girlfriend is tall and skinny. I got defensive and said, “Well Im not attracted to fat basic bitches like you.” Granted, she’s not even fat, just thick/chunky. But she does overdo the spray tan and she looks like every basic girl ever. I guess a lot of guys are after that look but not me.

She called me a cunt and later her friends found her in the bathroom crying. People are villifying me but she practically pushed me to it, especially insulting my girlfriend like that. I stand by what I said though, and she should know that her words have consequences. AITA?"
"AITA for expecting my ex to pay for half of my student loans? | After 15 years we are calling it quits. No drama or fighting - we get along ok - just no more happiness between us. When we got married she carried many years of student debt from her college days and we eventually paid it off.  About 7 years ago I decided to go back and finish my degree and we both thought this was a good idea since my career had stalled.  I took on student debt.  Yay.  Fast forward to now and we are deciding who is taking what debt and we've agreed on all it so far except she doesn't think she should have to take on any of my student loans.  I think since i took on hers, its only fair.  So AITA or what?

Edit: a lot of you are suggesting I seek legal advice.   I've already looked into this and if I choose to push it I have the legal advantage here.  I'm not concerned about that though.  I care more about the AITA aspect.  I don't want to be.

** Update **. After reading everyones thoughts, one comment really stuck out and swayed me.  ""That's what married couples do"".  While I would probably not have gone back to school without thinking that she was here to help pay back the loan, it was my choice.  I choose to share a life and bank account with her which included taking on her debt.  Splitting up means sacraficing and this is one that's on me.  So, IATA."
"AITA: For refusing to let my ex-wife take my car | 
Alright guys, today my (M36) ex-wife (F34) was coming over to pick our son and go do some grocery shopping and have fun together.

Once she arrived we said hi but started her bad habit of commenting on stuff like why my son's bedroom was so messy, why the dishes are still in the dishwasher etc.
I do my best to tidy up but i know she does this just to piss me off, and ruin my day, honestly i do not hate my ex-wife like most would, i was the one who wanted to divorce cause of her false accusations of me cheating on her, i just couldn't live with this anymore so i took a step back, knew what was right for the three of us.

anyways, After she completed her tour around the house, she asked for my car keys, and said she wanted to take my car to go grocery shopping, I told her ""no"" (for many reasons, one of em her being a terrible driver, and 2 the fact that she isn't my wife anymore we don't share the same stuff like we used to anymore).

But she lashed out on me saying for once in my life i should think about my son and do something to make him happy.
What??? Where is that coming from? She never even tried to smile or pretend like she's happy whenever she's around my kid, she's such a bad influence and has negative vibes.

So, here's what i suggested to which she replied with a BIG NO! I offered her a ride, i told my son, mommy can't drive (cause he looked upset i had to explain to him) but I could give you guys a ride and wait til you get done, but she was very aggressive and went "" you're not playing any games with me"" sort of thing, yeah, she's a little loco, and paranoid, i told her this is the only option we have but she pulled out her cellphone, I asked her who she was calling and she said she was gonna call her boyfriend to come pick em up, i got pissed off and said NO my son isn't going shopping with this asshole boyfriend of hers, she said i don't get a say in this, wtf??? Hell yeah i do!!!

I insisted on taking em, but she refused, it took us about a half an hour arguing, and she was finally convinced and said that she'll do it JUST for our son, yeah okay.

Ten minutes ride, and she didn't stop running her mouth and making negative comments on everything i did.

AITA i didn't let her have my car keys in the first place?"
"AITA For Reporting My College Professor Kissing a Student's Neck? | So my professor (we'll call him Proff A) is this really young guy who tends to hang out socially with some of the students. Like, I'm pretty sure he's under 25. 

This class is in a computer lab, and it's pretty frequent for student's who aren't in the class to come do their own work on a free computer station. There's one senior girl (we'll call her V) who has sat in on almost every single one of Proff A's classes. About a week ago, after class was over, there were still a few students working on the computers including me and V. I caught Proff A walking over to V, looking over at the project she was working on, and kissing her quickly on the neck. V did not react to this at all. 

I thought this was really inappropriate for a faculty member to do something like that, and I brought it up with a guidance counselor and a few of my friends. Proff A was placed under investigation, but didn't get fired because apparently Proff A and V were dating for several months at that point, and apparently student/teacher relationships aren't technically against the rules if the student isn't in the professor's class, and it's a consensual relationship.   


So okay, no harm no fowl. I didn't realize Proff A and V were dating, and he didn't lose his job. But somehow people found out that I was the one that reported him, and now everyone in my major (which is pretty small) has been treating me like shit, and accusing me of trying to fuck over Proff A, when I was just trying to make sure he wasn't inappropriately kissing a student in class. 

So AITA for reporting him? Maybe I should have talked to V first, idk."
"WIBTA if I asked my new parents in law why they didn't give us a present or contribute towards our wedding? | Despite the dramatic title there's no family drama past or present to cause problems.. It wasn't until today (2 days after the wedding) when we took stock of presents in order to send out thankyou cards etc that we realized his parents didn't give us anything. My parents contributed a lot of money despite being poorer. However his parents are getting on a bit and it is possible they simply forgot.
I'm in two minds about the whole thing and it's difficult for me not to read negative things into the lack of help or gifts. We said publicly we didn't expect anything and gifts are superficial really but on the other it does mean something, especially from the new parents in law, right? 
I'm feeling pretty conflicted about bringing it up but I think it's something which might affect my future relationship with them. So, would I be the asshole to ask them about it?

Edit: I need to add, we said we didn't expect gifts but would be grateful for contributions towards the wedding/honeymoon. 
However I do agree with the general consensus it'd be a mistake to bring it up. Thanks Reddit!"
"AITA for telling my professor he's disrupting the class? | I am taking a few courses at my college this summer, to help lighten the load come fall. This one professor had a decent review on [RateMyProfessor.com](https://RateMyProfessor.com), but one thing a lot of students definitely said was that he’s a hard ass about his cellphone/distractions policy. Now, I don’t care about that. Summer sessions are shorter, so you need to focus more and sped a lot more time in class, learning the material.

The thing is, this professor, if he seems someone on their cellphone or suspects they’re using their laptop for anything other than notes, will stop the lecture to go over and yell at them. This happens multiple times, throughout the class. It gets annoying, disrupts class and basically ruins whatever we’re doing. I get it’s disrespectful and that it’s on these students too, but if he just ignored it (especially as they’re doing it silently-no music or anything, I don’t even know they’re doing it until the professor is yelling-and it’s not bothering us), we could move along.

Today, he did it quite a few times within the first half hour of class. I got so frustrated with him, because we barely got through the first bit of the lecture and I felt like I was back in high school, not a university classroom. I let out an audible grumble and the professor gave me a look. I asked “Can we just go on with class?” He said, “When this student puts their phone away.” I said “You stopping class every time someone takes their phone out, takes away from us learning. It’s more annoying than a cellphone, to be honest.” He started on the syllabus and I just said I didn’t want to argue, I just wanted to learn.

After class, we all got an e-mail about the policies again and if we “had any issues with how he ran his classroom, to please see him after class”.

I don’t know if I made things better or worse. The class is over next week, thank God, I just had to say something because I feel like I learned so little in this class. (Btw, I have never been yelled at by him before this entire session, so I’m not being bitter about it or anything. I’m just being annoyed about having to stop class.) Was I an asshole for speaking up? He’s making it out that I was disrespectful for doing so."
"AITA for not inviting a specific coworker over to a bbq tomorrow? | I’ve got a coworker, Juliet, that sits next to me. That I have worked with for the past 3 years. I honestly find her unpleasant to be around. 

So tomorrow Im having a bbq. I invited the group of coworkers that I hang out with at lunch along. They’ve pretty much become my friends there.

Towards the end of the day. A newer coworker that I’ve recently really gotten along with came over to my desk and asked what time they should come over for the bbq and if they could bring anything. Within earshot of Juliet.

After they left Juliet goes:

“So, you’re having a barbecue?”

I said

“Yeah, I thought I’d have one while it still feels like summer”.

She said “cool” and got quiet so I thought that was the end of it.

But anyway a little while ago I got a text from another coworker who is a mutual friend of both of ours. The text said:

Hey, Juliet doesn’t have any plans this weekend. It is okay if she comes over too, tomorrow?

Am I the asshole if I tell him no?"
"AITA If I left my gf downtown drunk... | Disclaimer: Ive been drinking so I hope this is legible. 
        Here we go! So I took my gf out at 2pm for drinks at the cws. We had wristbands that allowed us free drinks and food. We drink till about 6 until things get shitty for me, at least. Just imagine how much you can drink when it's free! Well we are having fun, until I realise our dog has been in the kennel at home for 6 hours at this point. So I say ""hey babe, it's time to go, the dog needs to go out"" and I'm met with nothing but the unrecognizable drunk women I've had run ins with in the past. I convinced her to walk out of the place and she is just being the worst drunk person you could imagine (I'm almost used to it at this point) we walk and I'm told things like ""dont worry you're not a man and I dont want you"" ""leave me, idgaf about you!"" Regular drunk shit, right? Then. she fell and cut her chin and knees... I try to help her up and I was met with flailing arms and ""GET OFF ME!"" At the top of them lungs. That was my last straw. I left her there with her own vehicle to figure it out. On another note she bartends at a club in 4 hours... good luck! Well I came home and took care of the dog and now I'm regretting it... i do know I'm a dick for this, but it's not the first, second, third,fourth, fifth.... u get the idea. I'm over the drunk shit.... basically AITA???

Edit: so I went back downtown. I found her about to get picked up from the police. They told me they about lost their patience and took her into the drunk tank. I called her phone and a random dude picked up and told me he found the phone in the street. So I got the phone saved her from a public intox. We head home and she tries to jump out on the interstate.... see her phone is going off and another not so random dude is on the other end.... yes that's what I'm thinking. Hope yall had a better day/night then me!"
"AITA for destroying my kid's new handheld Tetris high score? | So, I let my kids pick out a couple toys at Target for a few reasons, including them just being awesome kids.  One of the things my 11 year old picks out is this little Tetris arcade machine. He's pretty excited about it. Plays it here and there.  Fast forward to the weekend and we get a challenge going - who can get the higher score. 

He plays and gets about 6k. Talks some smack before and after. But, says if I beat that, I have to beat his best score of 20k.

Alright. 

I play and wipe the 6k goal. He starts checking in every so often. I keep going. Passed the 20k goal. Still going strong.  At this point, he's kinda stopped asking where I was but still checks a couple times.

At 100k, I start to feel like I'm beating a sad, dead horse to death.  He seems kinda quiet.  I make it to 130k and could keep going but, instead, stack the blocks to fail.

He seems too quiet still. At this point, I feel like I went way overboard and maybe destroyed his enthusiasm for the game.  

I'm the asshole here, aren't I?

POST EDIT:  I wanted to say that I really appreciate everyone's tips, thoughts and comments.  He usually destroys me in FPS games we play together and I don't get a show off on very many shared interests so I think I went way over.  This is a good course correction for me."
"AITA for resenting people who are waiting on me to be “rich” so I can treat them? | Warning: this is a bit long. I’m on mobile. 

TLDR at the bottom. 

Background: I’m a medical student at my dream school. I will be the first to get a doctorate in my family. Most of my family and friends come from low income backgrounds and that’s the life I grew up in.

I’m living off scholarship in med school right now, but I am very good at budgeting and occasionally have funds to spend on the people I care about. Not a lot, but enough to take my grandma out to dinner or treat my best friend to a night out every once in a while. 

A lot of times people will insist on paying since I’m a student with no real income. I tell them I don’t mind, that I wouldn’t do it if I couldn’t afford to. They often insist anyway. Now, I do appreciate the gesture and their sentiment, but what usually bothers me is what a lot of these people say immediately afterward.

“You can treat me with expensive dinners and five star restaurants when you’re a rich doctor!” (Or some variation there of.)

Now this may just be me being petty but I really resent that people assume that I’m going to just want to blow money on them if I start actually making money one day. 

To me, a persons income shouldn’t ever be relevant to your relationship. Someone could make a million dollars and still take my ass to IHOP and I’d be over the moon that a friend wants to treat me to anything. 

It just really irks me because A LOT of people in my life say things like this. My mom, my friends, a lot of extended family. Basically anybody who occasional treats me to something, they basically say they’re treating me now so I can treat them later.
My best friend from college used to joke that she was “investing” in me now for when I could afford to treat her in the future. 

I feel like a huge asshole now because all I think now is that when I doing start actually making money I won’t want to spend it on anybody because they’re basically saying they’re entitled to the benefits of my labor because they treated me to dinner a couple of times when I was broke. 

I mentioned this to my mom and she called me ungrateful and said that I have to pay back people who supported me along the way. I countered that she was the only person who really financially supported me, and even then, I got through college on full scholarship, same for med school. She is probably the only person I’d want to take care of despite her entitlement simply because she’s actually always been there to support me when needed for things besides money.

She’s still convinced I’m being super petty, cheap, and ungrateful to everyone else. I honestly want to know if she’s right because sometimes even I have my doubts that I’m right. 

TLDR: Am I being petty for resenting people who say that they don’t mind spending money on broke me now because future rich me can treat them to even more fancy stuff later in life?

Edit: to clarify, I don’t believe all the people in my life who have made jokes like this are being genuinely serious. But there are a handful of people that do this repetitively that I think deep down are serious about it. 

And to amend: It wasn’t just my labor that got me to where I am. It took a lot of things coming together in just the right way and the help of a lot of people. 
I meant it more like it was not THOSE people who only make me feel like a cash cow who helped me get to where I am today."
"AITA for making my roommates look like we live in a stereotypical trailer park house? | This happened last Saturday. I want to start by giving some background.

I am a 20 year old male. I am living with three women and one man in a four bedroom house. We split the rent four ways and live in moderate walking distance of the university all but one of us attend. I am from Alabama originally, and they are all from California (LA to be specific). 

The lease is up early next year, and I am planning on ditching them on that day. They are fucking intolerable people. I am woken up, as a minimum, four days a week to somebody shouting about something somebody else did. The girl and her boyfriend have frequent meltdowns, which they occasionally take onto our front lawn, causing the neighbors in the surrounding houses to come out and stare. It is humiliating being the guy who lives in the house with the people who get into shouting matches regularly. Whenever they start, I go up to my room, close the door, put on headphones, and ignore them.

The neighbors have had it up to here with their crap and I don't blame them. Naturally I am often deemed guilty by association.

Last Saturday, at around 11 in the morning, they began having one of their arguments again. I was playing WoW happily in my room, but it was so loud this time I couldn't even concentrate. The woman shouted that she was leaving, and did her usual pretending to pack her shit into the car. Her boyfriend followed her out and they started their typical shouting match on our front lawn.

At this point I had just had it with their shit and frankly could not give less of a fuck. I put on my most raggedy pair of boxers, a wife beater that fully accentuated my gut and chest hair, grabbed a beer from the fridge, and went out sipping it and watching them. I went within five feet of them and started shouting things like ""who hit you in your face"" and ""dangit girl I'm telling you the boy ain't right."" In this middle-upper class suburbia, basically all of the neighbors were watching me put on the heavy Southern drawl while the two of them redirected their anger at me and it ended up becoming a three person shouting match with me playing the part of a drunk. 30 minutes later they had made up completely and now think I'm a huge dickhead.

I knew they would hate me for this, but the other members of our house have teamed up and now they're looking for someone to take over my part of the lease. I honestly don't give a single crap, but I'm wondering if I may be the asshole in this situation."
"AITA for being offended that my wife was glad that I missed the birth of our child? | My wife and I had our first child a few months ago. The child came 3 weeks early. I was out of state, and wasn't able to get to the hospital until the next day. Just in time to see them released and take them home.

I've always felt bad about this, but she seemed kind of blasé about it. In her family, women typically give birth with just doctors/the midwife around and the entire family comes later because they believe the father ""shouldn't see that"". We were going to do a more traditional birth. I had actually really wanted to see my first child be born. 

We were at a cookout last Saturday, and my pregnant SIL was talking about how they want their birth plan to go, and my wife seemed horrified that she wanted her spouse and family with her. She jokingly asked her if she wanted to STAY married after, as ""no man would want to stay with a woman after viewing that"". She said that ""[my name] didn't view anything until it was over and everything looked nice, as it should be"" and that she was relieved that I didn't end up being there to ""view that"".

I got a little upset. I didn't get to see my child until they were a day old, I missed the entire birth, and she's... happy about that? She obviously wanted to have a perfect image, but didn't care about her child's OTHER PARENT getting to bond. She didn't even allow her own family to visit her in the hospital until she'd been cleaned and got the hang of breastfeeding, so the only pictures taken before 12 hours old are a few pictures she took with her phone. God forbid she didn't look perfect and have a full face of makeup for new mother pictures I guess. 

AITA here?"
"WIBTA for wanting to use my late best friends sperm to conceive a child with my wife. | I'm infertile and I am considering starting a family with my wife. We have had long discussion on using donor sperm. We have received lots of input from friends and family to consider our options. We are leaning heavily towards using anonymous sperm but some people have suggested using someone we know.

I have known my late best friend since we were 5 years old. He tragically passed away in motor accident around 2 years ago. I recently caught up with his wife and told her about my situation. They had their first child naturally and the second child via IVF. She then offered me the remaining sperm samples as she planned to stop paying for the storage. I consulted my wife with this option and she was happy to consider it if it was what I wanted. The only opposition to this is coming from my wife's parents who recommend someone alive and in our circle. I'm against this. Unfortunately, word spread to my best friends mother who is also against this as she is doesn't like the idea of having a biological grandchild she will never meet. Despite this, WIBTA for taking up the offer?"
"AITA for not allowing our son to visit his grandmothers house because she smokes indoors? (Please read before responding) | My partner is angry with me for not allowing our two month old to visit his mother's house. My reason is that she smokes indoors and I don't want him exposed to it. She does not smoke around the baby, or in the house while he is there, but she smokes in the house in her day to day life. He feels I'm being unfair. 

I plan to show him this thread and the responses. 
Please provide factual material from reliable sources for any and all arguments made for either case."
"WIBTA If I canceled my sister's debt instead of giving a gift for her birthday | I started to keep notes of my day to day spending about two years ago, at the same time I also started keeping track of who was borrowing money and how much. I quickly realised that my sister's habit of ""borrowing money for legitimate reasons and not reimbursing that money"" quickly rose to a not insignificant amount, it currently sit at almost €500. I don't begrudged her or anything, because she doesn't have a steady source of income like I do, but at the same time she's an adult and should be able to manage her spending according to her means.

So this year, instead of giving her a classic gift, I plan to give her a partial debt relief. I haven't decided on the sum I'm gonna cancel, currently I'm planning to do about 100€. I'm making this look like an official document, with hand calligraphed title, and some jokes inside to lighten the mood. 

WIBTA if I cancel part of my sister's debt instead of giving a classic gift for her birthday ?

**Edit**

A few clarifications, yes she is aware of her debt and I make sure that it's clear every time she borrows money. I'm not putting simple groceries for the home on her tab. 

E.g. of reasons I lend her money : money for the cab, I paid for her driver license card, online orders I do for her because she prefer not to do herself,... You get the picture.

I didn't plan to do that in the first place,  but now I'm going to make sure not to give it in front of other people. And I'm adding normal gift things, but for a smaller amount and the whole thing will be more than I would normally spend for a gift (and [I'm not](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bxd26n/z/eq5heay) someone who like giving or receiving gift in the first place)."
"AITA for not tipping the bartender for a $1 drink? | A local bar has $1 beers every weekday. Standard tip is 15-20%, and I didn't have any coins on me, so I decided not to leave a 15 cent tip on a $1 beer. If I had gotten a few drinks, I would certainly have left a tip but I did not see the need to leave a couple cents for a single beer.

When I handed the bartender a single dollar bill for my drink, she said ""So I guess no one has taught you about tipping before. Bartenders make almost all their money off of tips, and this is not a bar that you want to not tip at."" I handed her another dollar because I did not want to deal with the uncomfortable situation, drank my beer, and left because the (in my opinion) rude service left me uninterested in the bar.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to give her a 100% tip because I didn't have any change on me?

EDIT: I should add that the beers were already poured and the bartender had to do no work other than moving a beer glass into my hand 12 inches away. "
"AITA for being resentful? Future in-laws collecting on an inherited loan to my fiancé. | Before we met, my fiancé Brad went to college; his parents did not contribute financially. So in addition to government loans, Brad took out an informal, low-interest loan from his grandfather to help pay for school. After graduation, Brad's uncle, who was in charge of Brad's grandfather's money, suggested that he address the government loans before repaying the private loan.

After paying off the government loans, Brad started paying off the loan from his grandfather, at which point his grandfather died. Brad's uncle divided the estate between his siblings and shorted Brad's parents the outstanding loan. Now Brad's parents are calling in to collect.

The balance is somewhat less than my non-retirement savings since I left undergrad, a few years before Brad did. I anticipate repaying the loan in full after the wedding, but it'll set us back on getting a house at least five years.

I've expressed my feelings to Brad, a few close friends and my family; everyone but Brad seems to be pretty unimpressed by his parents. There's some growing resentment on my part, for a handful of reasons:

* they intend to use the money to supplement the retirement they ignored for the last 20+ years
* the collected sum will have almost no effect on their retirement's overall trajectory, but *would* have a significant effect on ours
* Brad's parents were unwilling to contribute to his education, but have no issues with collecting money they never really earned in the first place because of it

...we should talk to a lawyer. But aside from the legal aspect, I'd like to know if I'm being commonsensically unreasonable -- AITA?"
"AITA for suggesting my husband rehome his dog to an animal shelter? | I (25F) recently got married to my husband (32M) we've lived together for 9 weeks.

While we dated he had someone to look after the dog.

The dog is a pug,11-12 and blind.

The person who looks after the dog recently quit so it's my husbands job to look after the dog.

He works from home so it should be easy.

I wake up at 5;40am to the dog barking, I tell my husband to put him outside to use the toilet and then leave at 6;30.

I get home at 6;50, should be relaxed as I had gone to the gym - not happening.

Come into the kitchen to cook dinner to the smell of dog mess, it absolutely reeked.

No matter how hard I scrub at our kitchen floor and living room floor i can't seem to get rid of the dog smell.

The dog is blind so he is always barking, hes scared so it's normal, my husband won't pay the dog *any* attention at all,like he won't touch the dog, feed the dog or walk the dog (the dog doesn't walk but I usually put him in a buggy and take him down to the beach)

I told him to rehome the dog, I have a friend who runs an animal shelter from her home, they have free roam to the house and aren't kept in kennels, they're well looked after, get attention and get walked.

Hes upset and thinks I'm an asshole for not helping look after the dog hes had for all of the dogs life.

Apparently I'm not considerate.

AITA?"
"AITA for not wanting to talk about it? | My parents often inquire about parts of my life. (As parents do.) Sometimes I respond with, “I don’t want to talk about it,” because it’s a sensitive subject or annoying to think about and I don’t want to discuss it or hear their opinions. They typically get offended and respond with, “well, fine. *huff*”

Example:
Today I woke up late for work. Because I still live with my parents, they were both aware of when I left the house. So when I got home, they asked me about it. I responded with not wanting to talk about it and they got offended. 

I get they want to hear about my day. But somethings are mine to think and talk about. I don’t want to relive the bad things that happened today for your curiosity.   Work is over now. 

AITA for wishing they would respect my consent and accept that I don’t want to discuss certain things with them?"
"AITA for potentially being the reason a student may not graduate college? | I am a senior student at a prestigious business school here in California. When you're in your final year of business school, you are in a lot of groups, doing a lot of group projects. I am taking an International Business course that required us to argue against another group and prove that our country would be a better place to expand a cosmetic brand into, blah blah blah boring school stuff.

&#x200B;

Anyway, the final project is pretty extensive, with lots of data, research, and overall time that goes into it. I am in a group of 5 people, including myself, and we have been killing it all semester. 95% on our first project together, and we all had been getting good individual scores on our individual papers. At the end of each group project, we would have to rate each other out of 10 categories, 10 points each.

&#x200B;

I am a pretty easy going going guy when it came to these grades. As long as you did your research and showed up to present it, I would give you a 100%. However, when it came to our final project, we had not heard from one of our partners in weeks. He stopped showing up to class and stopped responding to text, mind you we are seniors at this point and most of us are graduating after this semester.

&#x200B;

THEN, TWO DAYS before our assignment is due, he drops a message along the lines of, ""I was diagnosed with panic disorder and will not show up to present on Wednesday."" Basically hurtling his huge part of the presentation on us. Now in his defense, he did generate his own slides with their own information, but we had to integrate it into our own parts separately. We basically had to go through his research and formulate our own way of presenting it. I understand anxiety very well, but there is no excuse to doing that to your team. 

&#x200B;

Now back to the peer reviews, I rated him a 38/100 which adversely effects his grade. I did not discuss this with my group before because I figured they would have been on the same page as me. So, presenting day comes, we kill it, and immediately after we are done, our professor comes up and expresses our missing group members concern about passing this course (he needs it to graduate). She asks us up front if we think he deserves; no credit, partial credit, or full credit. My fellow three group members agree to give him full credit, and I was the last one who was asked. I hesitated and said, ""I got to go with my group on this one so give him full credit."" This is before she had read my peer review.

&#x200B;

Fast forward about a week, she post grades for the presentation. We scored a 98%, but at the end she posted a note that is directed towards me. It basically says, ""I am sorry for putting you on the spot like that, I have taken into consideration what you put in your review and have adjusted his grade accordingly.""

&#x200B;

Now I feel bad but I am also arguing with the logic that he really did not put in his part. So, in finality, AITA?"
"AITA for not wanting to do the fantasy portion (Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy) of holidays/events with my kids? | My wife and I just had a son a month ago and with Easter coming up she was talking about taking him to see the Easter Bunny and get pictures.  It got me thinking that I don’t really care about the Easter Bunny or other holiday stuff we tell kids.  I still want to celebrate all the holidays.  I want my kids to come downstairs to a full Easter basket or presents under the tree, but I don’t feel the need to tell them that some magical being brought them.  I am fine if they lose a tooth, just being excited and giving them 5 bucks, not doing the whole tooth fairy thing.  I feel like I’m being a party pooper, but I think they will still love Christmas without Santa Clause.  My wife thinks I’m being a grump.  AITA?"
"AITA for becoming apathetic not participating in my Fiancees choices | My Fiancee is the type of person to ask me to choose, but then say it is not what she wants and makes me choose some thing else, etc etc... She does this with everything, going out to eat, Netflix movies to watch, and more recently wedding choices.

I choose two venues I like, she chooses a different venue and has me choose. Nope not that one, not that one, etc. so we pick the ones she wants. I'm fine with that.

Suit and dress colors. Same deal. floral arrangements, her mom HAS to do them. I'm fine with all of this, I would be happy either way. The problem is that I hate making false choices when in the end it is what she wants. 

Recently she has been badgering me about cake flavors, I pick a 3 combinations the company listed that i believe i would want to eat. She says those choices are not good since not everyone would enjoy them. 

I basically say ""i don't care what others like, you asked what i wanted"" and i basically stopped contributing to decision making because in the end it doesn't matter. Now she is upset i am ""not Contributing and not putting in any effort to plan the wedding"" 

-AITA? I'm fine with her planning it, but i hate when my choices are disregarded after she pressures me to choose. It seems like she basically just wants me to reaffirm her choices but wont tell me what those choices are, then she regrets her choice and says we should have went with something else if i had just contributed. 

TLDR: Wife wants me to contribute more to our wedding but wont accept my choices, so i stopped contributing altogether out of frustration."
"AITA for being upset with how my wife is treating me, despite the fact that she is rightfully upset with me? | Ok, so I AM the asshole in this story in several ways. But I'm curious if I am an even bigger asshole for being upset with how my wife is reacting to this situation.  I'm at the character limit, ask info. 

My first asshole move - I was put on a performance plan at work, and didnt tell my wife.

I didnt tell my wife because I didnt think I was going to get fired. I was getting good feedback on my progress throughout the plan, some notes were made about where I needed further improvement but the tone of conversations was ""good job, we're getting there"" and my boss and I were regularly discussing projects and events that I would support which would take place well past the end of the plan. In this plan, they can decide to fire you at any time, but the day I actually got fired was the designated end date of the plan.

I should have told my wife, hands down, even when I thought my job was safe. I knew I wasnt performing to the best of my abilities for a number of reasons, which I dont want to list because I'm afraid it will just sound like I'm making excuses. I thought I was doing ""enough"", but if I had been doing my best this would not have happened.

So I told my wife, and she was initially supportive, although obviously upset that I didnt tell her it was possible for me to lose my job. However, since about 20min past that first conversation (a couple days ago), the support has evaporated.

For example, today when she got home from work, I got the silent treatment in this fashion:

I said hello when she walked in, got nothing. I asked what she wanted for dinner, got nothing. I suggested picking up sandwiches from a place she had mentioned earlier in the week, got nothing, I suggested a few things we have here I could cook, nothing. 
I give up for about an hour, then I say ""so that sandwich shop closes in less than an hour, want me to-""

""Fine.""

""..ok, I'll run and get it?""

""I'm coming with you.""

I fully understand she has a right to be upset with me for not being upfront. But I feel like I need her support right now. I know I fucked this all up, and I need to make it right - but the fact is we could live off of her salary alone (roughly matches my previous salary), I'm getting paid 6 months of severance pay, and we have a healthy savings. We dont have kids, our only debt is a car we could pay off tomorrow without touching our emergency fund. Getting fired is still not good and I am an asshole for getting fired, even bigger asshole for not telling her I might get fired, but come on - I'm the one who got fired! I am not in a good way right now.

Part of my struggle performing at work is mental health related, and we had discussed in previous months how I did not feel she was supporting me in bettering my mental health, and she agreed and said she would try. Well, now is when I need that support more than ever.

Am I being a childish asshole? Or should my wife be capable of simultaneously being upset with me and helping me cope?"
"AITA for not being willing to pay on dates. | I find the idea that I am expected to pay for a womans time demeaning. My time is just as valuable as my dates. I want someone that I can respect as an equal not someone that expects me to treat them like a child when it is convenient to them. For me a woman expecting me to pay is a dealbraker as I instantly lose respect for them.

I have had some people agree with this and some call me an asshole without being able to rationalise it. I thought it would be interesting to hear a wide range of perspectives. AITA?"
"AITA To Expect My GF to Cook & Clean at home? | I'm M27, She's F24. Been together for 2 years and living together for about 3 months now. Before we moved in we agreed that she would do all of the cooking/cleaning and taking care of my place since she doesn't work and is trying to get an online business started from home. Because she isn't bringing in an income I agreed to pay the entire rent while she gets her business up and running. She thought this was a good idea and agreed to do all the cooking, and cleaning. I don't really eat breakfast, so I usually just get coffee or some fruit but she did pack me a lunch daily and had dinner ready when I got home at around 6ish. We'd usually eat out like once or twice a week so she's not cooking every single day, but most I guess. 

About 3 weeks ago she said she didn't want to cook anymore and said I was treating her like a slave making her cook and clean all day. I just said well you live here rent free and you only clean maybe once a week and cooking doesn't take up all of your day and she got super mad and called me an asshole. She asked me to start cooking but I'm so tired/stressed from work I don't want to after and she's at home all day.

AITA?"
"AITA for refusing to break the law for my brother, despite both his and our parents’ insistence that I do? | My younger brother Bryan just turned 19 about month ago. About an hour ago, he casually mentioned if I could go get this moscotto (wine) that he likes because he and his girlfriend is celebrating their first year together. He said he needs it by 9 and just expected me to go and get it for him.

I told him I’m not really comfortable giving alcohol to someone whose underaged. It’s not like it’s far or anything (just a couple min drive from my house). But I live in America, so it’s illegal, and call me a straight edge or whatever but I don’t like breaking the law. Additionally, I don’t want to give him the impression that this is something that I’m willing to do often; if I give him alcohol now, he’d expect me to do it again in the future.

I said he can ask our parents but I’m definitely not going to break the law for him. He got pissy and said to “stop being a bitch, who cares?” I said I do, and so I’m not doing it, end of story.

He texted our parents, and they called me. I expected them to take my side so I put them on speaker phone, but they said they were planning a date night tonight and told me to handle it. I said no and explained why I didn’t want to give my underaged brother alcohol, but they said to “stop being difficult and just give him the damn wine”.

Bryan had a shit-eating grin after that and said “I’ll see you before 9”. I went to my car so I guess he assumed I was getting it for him, but instead I just drove to a friend’s house. I group texted Bryan and our parents, and said I wasn’t going to put my livelihood at risk and break the law for anyone, and if anyone had a problem with that, well too bad. I then put my phone on airplane mode and am currently typing this on my computer.

Did I do the right thing? I feel like my brother will be absolutely furious when I turn my phone on, but I feel like he’s acting like a little turd. AITA for how I handled the situation?

Update: turned my phone back on. Mom and dad are furious. All Bryan  texted was ""you know, you ruined what was supposed to be a special night and I hope it was worth it."" Starting to question if I did the right thing...

UPDATE 2: Got home last night. Brother wouldn't even look at me. I sent him a message saying that it wasn't anything against him or anything; I'm just really against the alcohol culture and I felt uncomfortable with the request. All he sent back was ""tbh, i don't really give a shit about your excuses, just leave me alone"". He won't answer any of my calls or texts anymore. My parents are furious for ""being such a square"" and said that between not giving my underaged brother alcohol and not being a legal slave (like forcing myself to do the shit they try to tell me to do e.g.  plant the garden that THEY want or spread the mulch that THEY want), they're genuinely considering kicking me out of the house or forcing me to start paying rent..."
"AITA for telling my fiance that I don’t want to give his kid so much physical affection? | I recently got engaged to a great guy. I love everything about him and am really excited to spend the rest of my life with him. However, my fiance has a 10 year old daughter from a previous marriage. I do not know all the details, but her bio mom isn’t in her life and possibly doesn’t even live in the same country as us. 

His daughter is very physically affectionate, especially with me. Not long after we met, she insisted on giving me multiple hugs and kisses a day and wanted me to snuggle with her whenever I come over to my fiance’s house. Not gonna lie, his kid wants to do everything and anything with me and tells her dad that she wishes I were over more (when I'm already there 5-6 days a week at this point).  

She also wants to be cuddled to sleep. Honestly, if her dad or I aren’t there to hold her until she falls asleep, she won’t fall asleep until some ungodly hour (like 4 AM when her elementary school starts at 8 AM sharp). 

I didn’t grow up with much physical affection and am not comfortable being all huggy and kissy with anyone except romantic partners (so her dad essentially). I’m fine with hugging and kissing men I date. However, it feels awkward sometimes to have to reciprocate the amount of love and attention his kid gives me. It’s just too much sometimes honestly. I’ve told my fiance that I sometimes feel overwhelmed by his daughter’s affection and he’s kind of just glossed over what I’ve had to say. Either that or he’ll tell me that he wished parental-like affection came more naturally to me. 

However, I am fine with doing everything else a parental figure might have to do for a young girl--just not always the physical affection.

AITA for telling my fiance that I get overwhelmed by the amount of hugs and cuddling this hid wants?

**Edit:** I've done some thinking. I think some of the comments her mentioned she was so affectionate because she was scared I'd leave. I honestly never thought of it like that. I thought she was just doing that to be annoying. I feel pretty terrible now. I didn't know she wanted a mom so badly in her life and that she was so scared she'd lose me. I've talked to my fiance about this and we're going to get her into therapy starting Monday. I may be unsure about being a parent and a mom since I've never had any kids before but now that I see things from her perspective, I've resolved to do better and be better for her to hopefully make her feel more secure and loved. I feel awful that I've allowed this to continue on for the better part of two years and that I wasn't seeing things from her point of view. I'll get into therapy to hopefully get more comfortable with touch and see if my to-be stepdaughter and I can work out a compromise on the touching. For now, I'll try to reciprocate the hugging, cuddling and kissing as best as I can and tonight, I'll be the one who snuggles her to sleep and reads her a book."
"AITA for photoshopping my fiancee out of certain pictures? | I'm really confused on how I could be the asshole. 
 
I uploaded some photos of me and my fiancee on Snapchat. She asks me in private to take them down, since I took it as soon as we woke up and she didn't look good.
 
I said okay. I took then down, photoshopped her out of it, and then reuploaded it. She then came at me half shouting and half in tears. She's saying that I only reaffirmed her insecurities. I don't know how I did that. She didn't want to be in a certain picture, and I took her out.
 
AITA? If so, how?"
"AITA for not being super happy for my friends engagement? | For some context, my friend, we'll call her C, has never had a lot of luck in the romance department. She's only really had one serious boyfriend and that's it. She recently started dating this nice girl, we'll call her K. They didn't really know each other long before becoming an item.

K is emotionally unstable, but a very sweet girl when not triggered. K and C have only been dating about 3 months now, and K gave C a promise ring about one month into their relationship. Not as big of deal to me anyway, I had a few promise rings. Well last night they got engaged. I didn't say anything to them as I was kinda shocked that they're moving so quickly at this point, seemingly not really knowing each other. It kinda feels like they're wanting a wedding, not a marriage.

I worry for her because this seems like a huge red flag to me to be engaged after such a short time. I haven't said anything really since last night, and my other friends are calling me an asshole for not congratulating them.

So reddit, AITA for not really being happy about a friend engagement?

Probably should have seen this coming but an edit: I never said I wasn't going to congratulating them, I just haven't yet."
"AITA refusing to quit camming for my twin sister? | Hi there. I make all of money camming. It's a good amount but I'm disabled and have no other skills so finding other work isn't an option. I was doing it in secret from family and when asked how I made my money I said that I did remote tech support for an overseas company.

Recently I got found out because my (twin) sister got asked by a guy in a grocery store if she was \[camsite username\]. She said no but the guy didn't believe her and kept asking until she had to leave the store. I guess she looked up the name online because she found my page and shortly after called me, furiously asking what the fuck.

I told her that yes I did camming and I yes I was lying about it because.... you don't really tell family that sort of thing? So she insisted that I stop because she works as a lawyer and it could ruin her reputation. I told her no because it's my only source of income and I would be screwed if I couldn't keep doing it. She demanded that I do it anyway. I asked her what I was supposed to do for money? She said to figure it out. I said no and if she wants me to quit so bad she can fund my lifestyle with her lawyer money. She told me to go fuck myself and hung up.

Now my whole family knows and they're all just as mad telling me that I need to quit. I told them the same thing, that I need the money to live and that if they want me to quit I will need to have my life paid for. I feel really bad though but like... what else am I supposed to do? I need money to live!!!!"
"AITA for yelling at my wife when she made a joke about my dead mother | My mom died a few days ago and today we went to her house to go through her stuff, as she left it all to me and we inevitably can’t take all of it. 

I found her old set of teacups and was telling a story about how she always used to complain that the handles were too small for her fingers.

My wife then decides it’s a great idea to say “well guess she can’t complain now”. 

I lost it and yelled at her about how disrespectful it was and that she should know better than to say something like that. 

She starts crying and leaves and I’m planning on sleeping here. She texts me that I shouldn’t yell at her.

AITA?"
"AITA for not tipping when paying with fake money? | So my University partners with the local Pizza Hut, and after 8pm we can order food using our declining balance (essentially coal miner bucks that we are given at the beginning of each semester). However, they up charge all of their products, so a $40 order ends up being $50 when using decking balance.

So last night I ordered a med pizza and two orders of wings using this method, and when my driver arrived (late 50s early 60s) he put the food in my hand and immediately went on a rant about how “we do everything for you guys, we do accept tips you know”. I told him that I’m sorry but if I had actual money I wouldn’t be paying with my university card. I asked if he had Venmo, I had like $8 in my bank account, and he just got in his car and sped off.

I know that they mainly rely on tips, but when the restaurant charges $10 more than the actual price I assume that it’s for a reason. 

P.s. you aren’t allowed to tip with your declining balance which is bullshit.

EDIT: spelling"
"AITA for not wanting my wife to have any bridesmaids because I have no groomsmen? | I saw the other post about six groomsmen/bridesmaid and it reminded me of my own situation. I thought it'd be helpful to ask here because of the similarity yet also dissimilarity.

We're getting married in October. Small ceremony, only 50 people or so. My wife has plans for a maid of honor and four bridesmaids and I don't really have anyone who can fit the role of groomsmen or dude of distinction.

Why? Eight years ago, my three closest friends were in a helicopter accident and sadly passed on. I was meant to go with them (it was their gap year to Nepal and other nations in Asia) but I couldn't afford to take time off work. I've been dealing with survivor's guilt and depression ever since but my soon-to-be wife has helped me through it. These were to be the people I'd choose to be by my side as I'm getting married.

I've kind of become reclusive since and have lost a few friends and didn't make many others. I don't really have anyone who could stand by me, family or friend. I asked my wife if she'd consider just doing the wedding solo (so no bridesmaids or groomsmen) so it's equal and you can imagine it's not been an easy conversation.

I know she shouldn't suffer because of me or my thoughts, but having her up there with her closest friends and I have literally no one with me is just going to make my coping that much more difficult.

Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for finding a punishment that actually worked on my daughter? | I have a 16 year old daughter, and she has 3 big chores that we pay her allowance for. She puts out the garbage, cleans up the dog poop in the backyard, and empties the dishwasher. I refill the dishwasher, so when she doesn't do her job I can't do mine (yes, I could just do it myself, and I have, but we pay her to do it, so why should I?) 

This weekend my wife asked her to empty the dishwasher, and take the trash out. She said ""Ok"" then just went up to her room. I went up to her room an hour later, and found her laying in bed watching youtube on her phone (Volleyball videos, nothing important, if anything on youtube could be considered important) I took her phone away, and said ""Your mom asked you to do your chores, not watch videos, please do them so i can do mine"" She said ""Whatever"" and just continued laying there. So I told her if she is not down in 10 minutes I was going to send a picture of myself to all of her friends on snapchat. Now we have tried plenty of different methods of punishment, but nothing really gets to her. I know how important social media is to the kids now a days, so i figured I would try that, and see if anything happened.

I gave her 20 minutes, and still nothing. So true to my word my wife and I took a selfie on her phone and I sent it to all of her friends with the caption ""Someone didn't do her chores like we asked :'( "" I didn't go through her messages, i didn't even read the replies to our picture, that was it. A few of her friends know me, and know what I'm like, but apparently the picture went to a group chat from her school, and to a few boys she liked and just stalked on social media, but didn't message. She says it was so embarrassing, and I'm an a-hole for doing that.

But come last night, my wife asked her to do the dishes. She first refused and went up to her room, but I reminded her what would happen if she didn't listen. She was downstairs like a rocket and put the dishes away so fast she almost broke some of them. So obviously the punishment seemed to have worked (for now), but she screamed at me calling me an a-hole all night. I am just a Stepdad, so I'm still fairly new at this. So I thought I would bring the vote to you guys. AITA here?"
"WIBTA if I asked my parents to stop making me pay rent? | I’m a 21 year old living with my parents and my two younger brothers (both in elementary school). My schedule consists of working ~8 hour shifts Tuesday, Thursday, and weekends, while having class for 8 hours on MWF. This does not account for time spent on homework. 

I pay my parents $150 in rent every month because they claim to be struggling with bills and I can’t afford my own place only working ~30 hours a week on $11/hour. 

However, they seem to be doing fine, buying new beds and televisions and generally blowing money on unnecessary things. 

Since I pay for my own car insurance, gas, tolls (necessity, unless I want to use double the gas and take 90+ minutes to get to school), and phone bill, I’m stretched thin on money as is. I’m barely able to save for when I’m out of school, let alone spend money on anything during my little free time.

So given the situation, if I asked them to hold off on asking for rent, would I be an entitled asshole? Or would that be reasonable?

Edit: The general consensus so far is that yes, I am the asshole. I felt so when I first posed this question to myself, but I wanted some outside opinions. While I don’t agree with the attitude some have presented, I understand the judgement. I have lived on my own before, and I understand that it can be much worse. However, I personally feel like that money would be much better put towards my loans before they start gaining interest. 

Edit2: I'm thoroughly convinced that half of you are not reading the entire post. I am aware that this is not a lot of money as far as rent is concerned, I lived on my own for over a year when we first moved into this state, but I was not in school. 

When my classes started, my parents asked me to move back in with them, knowing that I wouldn't be able to work enough while in school to pay for a full apartment's worth of rent. I do my own laundry, keep my area clean, pay for my own food, gas, car insurance, tolls, EVERYTHING. 

I know how to manage my money, but when you're in class 24 hours per week and working another 28-30, the amount of gas and toll payments skyrocket. And no, there aren't any alternatives to my route, not without doubling or tripling the amount of time it takes me to get anywhere.

Thanks again to everyone who isn't just insulting me."
"AITA for killing a spider? | I promise this story isn’t BS. Yes i know you’ll think this is dumb, don’t worry I do too. 

I hate spiders, it’s not a phobia but I don’t like them and I certainly don’t want them in my residence.

I found one and I went to get a couple paper towels to kill it and put it in the trash. My girlfriend was over and asked what I’m doing and I told her. She said I shouldn’t do that and I was like huh? Her suggestion was to put it outside and not kill it because “it’s not harming anyone”. So I said, if you think it should be outside, go do it yourself. She was like nah spiders are gross. The look on my face was just wtf?????????????????? 

So since she didn’t want to do it I killed it anyways. When I told her she legit started crying and said I’m a huge asshole and I didn’t have to kill it and yada yada yada. AITA?"
"AITA for asking my divorced parents to act like a family a couple times a year? | My (17M) parents divorced when I was 9. It was devastating to me as a 9 yo but my parents were civil to one another and the separation and divorce wasn't a hate fest between them. For my first birthday after the divorce I asked for a ""family day""- one day where we got together the three of us and had dinner and did something (that bday we went to the zoo). I asked for the same thing for Christmas and have asked for this every year on my bday and Christmas. I also ask that my parents both be there for random things, like when I had surgery or when I was hospitalized with the flu a few years ago. I'm a junior this year and scheduling college visits and want them both to be there for those as well. My parents aren't friends but they are civil with one another and don't seem to hate when I want the three of us together. Neither remarried but have dated since the divorce and their SO is not invited to these ""family days.""- Edited to add: neither has a SO currently. My dad dated someone for two years but outside of that there has been no other serious relationship for either of them since the divorce. 

Yesterday I was talking to an uncle about a college visit we were planning and mentioned something about finding a weekend both my mom and dad were free and my uncle made a comment about me still doing the “happy family” nonsense and how I was old enough to let that go and I was kinda being a jerk by making my parents have to pretend for a day. He alluded to how painful the divorce was for them (I do not know why they divorced and although adultery was once mentioned in a conversation I wasn’t meant to overhear, I don’t know which of my parents they were talking about and don’t really want to know if they did)  I was taken aback as I never got the sense my parents were bothered by my request. I separately asked them about it later and they both said they were happy to do it for me and a couple times a year didn’t bother them. They both said it was awkward at times but not something they dread doing.

I mentioned it to my best friend and my girlfriend and they both think I am being a bit of a selfish and lots of parents divorce and I should just  give up the family days .I really don’t want to- I really like those days and I like that I’ve been able to make memories with both my parents even though they are divorced. AITA for continuing these days?

&#x200B;

Edited to add: We do not spend Christmas day together. We do something together in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Usually we just do dinner and a show of some sort. One year they surprised me and we took the train to NYC and stayed overnight there and saw the Rockettes, went shopping, and ice skaing.Also, the college visits together idea was originally my mom's because I was going to tour their alma mater and she asked if I wanted her and my dad to both take me since they both went there and both would probably want to go. My dad agreed that he thought they both should go and from there they've both wanted to be involved with campus tours."
"AITA for how I handled my friend's seizure | Edit:: Thank you everyone for your comments, it really gives us a lot to think about. We checked in with them and apologized for our insensitivity.  The judgements seem pretty mixed but I will accept the people saying I'm the asshole. There are a lot more specific details I could include which could possibly validate our reasoning for behaving the way we did. But this post is getting a bit more traction than I expected and I don't want Taylor to find it. 

Stay safe everyone.

Edit 2:: I should include that his only history of seizures was another incident recently where drugs were the cause of it. I should have been more detailed in my original post
 *****

is just happened recently and is a challenging situation that I feel very conflicted about. I would appreciate some outside opinions because I honestly feel like I might have unintentionally been a dick. 

So I own a house with my partner but we rent out a couple of the rooms to close friends and family. This afternoon I was relaxing in my room with my partner when we hear a commotion and our roommate Taylor (who is my partner's sibling) across the hall is calling an ambulance because their boyfriend Tom is having a seizure episode. We had no idea he was epileptic but we spring into action clearing a path for paramedics and help as much as we can. 

Unfortunately, Tom was super disassociated and hysterical. It was super upsetting to see him walk up to the cop like a deer in the headlights without any pants on and didnt seem to understand. He didn't even remember his last name or birthday.  We got a lot of questioning about the situation but honestly didn't know what was going on and said as much.

After the ambulance left I was talking to my partner and other roommates and we had to ask Taylor what happened with Tom. He doesn't live with us and honestly we don't know him super well, but he has been dating Taylor for a while so he is our friend and we were incredibly concerned and worried. 

Now this may be where we fucked up, but we had to ask if it was possibly drug related. Tom has a history of drug abuse and just got out of rehab a month ago.  He has been living with family and trying to be on a good trajectory, but did offer us a little bit of drugs a couple weeks ago. 

So anyway Taylor freaks out and instantly gets mad defensive and personally offended that we would accuse such a thing. We tried to explain that we had a right to know what was going on and we are just trying to be real about the situation.   Taylor just starts yelling and goes to pack the bags and talks about moving out?!

I tried to explain it came from a place of compassion and support. I have a history of addiction and have experienced my share of drug induced episodes, as well as witnessed friends in similar situations. The only times ive seen another young person have a seizure it was drug induced, so it didn't seem out of the realm of possibility.

So yeah Taylor left pissed off and now I feel awful that we added more stress to an already shitty situation.

Am I the asshole for asking if he was using drugs that may have caused a seizure? Was the timing bad? how do I fix this? Thank you all so much!"
"AITA for telling my coworker to learn how to mind her own business? | EDIT: SHEILA IS MY EQUAL COWORKER, NOT MY SUPERVISOR

This happened yesterday. I am currently suspended from work for 2 weeks because of this incident.  

So i work after school shifts at a small local hardware store. Yesterday i walked into work and my buttocks was hurting very badly, but i tried to ignore it. After talking to a few coworkers about my duties for the day i said i had to run to the washroom. Once i was all finished i discovered a substantial amount of blood on the bath tissue i had used. *Cue panic*. I started hyperventilating and rushed out of the bathroom and across the store to get to our stock room, but my coworker, whomst we will call sheila (obv. not her real name) stopped me and told me i had to take some  boxes out to our warehouse. I politely said, “Yeah for sure i can do that just give me a second here to figure something out.” To which she replied “No. You need to do it right now.” At this point i was a little irritated, but i kept my cool and said “Sheila, i have blood coming out of my asshole right now, i need a minute to figure out what to do.” And after i had said that she decided to start yelling at me that i should have just stayed home or called in sick. I walked away and into out back room to call my dad (i didn’t know what to do i was panicking and crying). Before i left i went up to Sheila and said “You need to learn how to mind your own fucking business.” and walked away with her yelling at me.

AITA?"
"AITA for not wanting to purchase and transport $15k worth of alcohol for a work party? | So basically, the team I am on was tasked unexpectedly to be the party planners for a big corporate event. They asked for volunteers to use a corporate card to purchase all of the alcohol and transport it with their personal vehicle(s). I was completely uncomfortable with doing it because:

A) I don’t drink and would have no idea what I’m doing anyways. 

B) I feel like it’s a major liability risk to transport something like that in a personal vehicle for a company event. Even carrying cases of liquor up stairs seems like a liability risk.

C) I have deeply held religious beliefs against consuming alcohol. I don’t care if others do it. I don’t judge them, I’ll even hang out with them if they are drinking. I just don’t want to be a part of it myself. Just don’t ask me to hold your drink for you.

I mentioned this when they were assigning tasks and everyone was like, “that’s totally fine, I get it, etc...”

Then the person who procured the order sent a message to the whole team asking for help carrying it up the stairs in our building. Again I’m super uncomfortable with it and the whole team walks past my desk and someone asks “are you coming to help carry the alcohol and stuff?” I said “sure I’ll come help if there’s other stuff!” And started to stand up from my desk. 

Then I got a kind of nippy response, “nah it’s fine. We got it.”

Ok... so now I’m writing this and feeing like trash because of that.

TLDR; Company asked for volunteers to handle alcohol for an event. I felt uncomfortable and let them know. Things seemed fine until the entire team went down to help carry it up and made me feel like shit for not helping with it. 

AITA?

Edit: Obviously I felt conflicted about it. I did bring up my religious beliefs to my team and framed it that way. I also was concerned with others doing it from a liability standpoint and I did mention that to my manager. What if someone DID injure themselves doing this?

But then I wonder if it was a recovering alcoholic would people still criticize? Or would they still say the same thing? It’s interesting to see people’s take on where they draw the line and what beliefs they consider “sacred” enough to respect."
"AITA for calling out Shawarma lady for serving me microwaved Shawarma | So I am an ardent chicken lover and always down to try the newest and best food that's out there.
This happened when me and a friend of mine were at mall's food court. There was a new Shawarma outlet that had opened and of course i wanted to try it out. I went to the stall, gave my order and paid the salesperson the money and waited in front of the stall till my order was ready. I expected the lady to slice off chunks off the rotisserie and wrap it. Instead, she went inside her pantry and brought out some chunks of chicken and heated them in the microwave. I was obviously pissed. I went to stall and asked her Wtf she is doing and said that I wanted fresh Shawarma off the rotisserie and not whatever she brought from the pantry!

Following were her reasons for not giving me freshly cut pieces:

It's not economical for them for turn the rotisserie on and off every time they get an order so they do it just twice a day

That's how they usually do it

Nobody has ever complained about this (it's a relatively new shop)

All of the above was rubbish and I wanted my money's worth so I kicked up a fuss and asked to either return my money or give me a fresh fucking piece of chicken.

This is where my friend stepped dragged me away, ""apologized"" on my behalf and just asked her to give us the food. Later on I was berated about how I was being a difficult customer, they're a new establishment and I'm the last thing they need and that I should learn to ""adjust"" a bit sometimes.

AITA here really? I just wanted my money's worth. Being a new establishment doesn't mean they can slack off"
"AITA for denying a new employee's request for X-mas eve off? | We get Thanksgiving, X-Mas and NY's Day off. You can take the day before and after IF you have vacation time and if it's approved.We are trying to close the books for the year and everyone is tight on time and very few people are taking any additional days off. We hired an office assistant two weeks ago and she already requested the day after Thanksgiving off (even though we closed at noon on that day) and now she wants the two Mondays before Xmas and New Year's plus X-mas eve and New Year's eve off. She'll be on the job less than a month and already took five days off. Like I said, very few people are doing that and by her taking those days off, it increases the workload for everyone AND she barely has started her training which is being done by other staff (which increases their workload even more). She doesn't have plans per se, but she just wants to spend time with her parents and boyfriend. I am thisclose to denying her request on the basis that everyone in the office would like to take those days off to spend time with their loved ones yet they can't because there is too much work to be done. I feel like if she pushes back, then she needs to go.

&#x200B;

FYI - Most people end up taking a solid two or three weeks off in summer when things are less intense and submit their requests months in advance.

&#x200B;

EDIT: She has no PTO. The time she would take off would be unpaid which is a little concerning to me that she would be willing to go without pay, leave more work for less people and do it not once or twice, but three times. It makes me think she just wants to do her own thing. She's only 22.

&#x200B;

EDIT: The main issue is that if she isn't here, then there is more work for the people who are here to do. That means they have to stay later. Her not being here affects everyone. It's one thing to mention it when you got the job, another to mention it at the last minute. I don't want to have to tell her co-workers that they might have to stay late on the days she's gone because she wanted to spend time with her boyfriend."
"AITA if I ask to split rent by square footage? | My roommate and I are moving to a new place.

It has one master bedroom with a closet, one significantly smaller bedroom with no closet, one small living room, one den, a kitchen and a bathroom. And a creepy basement but that's beside the point. (it's really creepy)

The Den is in comparable size to the master bedroom, just without a closet. She agreed to let me convert it into a bedroom and she'd get the master bedroom. That leaves the smaller bedroom.

I don't really have a use for it. I don't own many things and I'm a neet in modern standards and prefer my room/solitude in the living room at times. Roommate has a lot of stuff as she lived by herself longer than I have and has accumulated more things.

She wants the smaller bedroom to convert into a studio for dancing, craft room for cosplay, storage and a place to put her boyfriend and his entertainment things. (Roommate's boyfriend does not live with us but visits daily.)

Edit: Before it was discussed that the smaller bedroom was going to be a storage room as well as an entertainment room for guests.

I'm okay with that, but I asked to pay less rent. She said no and her argument was by taking the Den, I took away from the common area usage and the rent should still be 50/50. My argument was I don't want to pay extra for space I'm not going to use ever and to split by square footage of the rooms. ie: Room space + common areas divided by half.

I just feel like I shouldn't pay equally for her extra room/boyfriend.

TLDR; Roommate wants extra room for a studio, I asked to split rent by square footage, she said no. AITA?  


Final Edit: I guess just to clear things up, I wrote the previous post emotionally and didn't concisely explain a lot of things I thought were minor details.  
1. Prior, when we first viewed the lower duplex, the smaller bedroom was going to be the shared storage room and an entertainment room. We agreed I would take the Den (same size as the master bedroom, just no closet) and the TV/entertainment stuff would be moved to the smaller bedroom as she has her boyfriend over daily. This was to declutter the living room and to also not compete in noise level as he plays youtube videos loudly/plays on his PS4. 

Now it seems like she wants it for private use. ie: the studio space/cosplay crafts room/place for her boyfriend's things/entertainment items/dance room. Which is why I had an issue. She's very strict about aesthetics, if I did try to use it for storage, there'd be a lot of rules in place. Had I known her stance changed before the final walkthrough, I wouldn't have signed the lease until we ironed it out again. (it was an edocument and she signed for me and then let me know. Not going to throw her to the police for this. She's still my friend at the end of the day and we were going to sign it eventually I guess. @\_@ )  
2. Roomie's bf does not live with us or contribute towards anything. Currently stays 9AM-9PM on weekdays at our current place but new place, he will not get keys to the new house. So looking more like 5PM-9PM weekdays. I feel like I pay for a third roommate and subsidize their relationship at times. He does not have a job and lives at his parent's.

3. Room Dimensions: Den and Master Bedroom are almost the same in square footage. Den does not have the ""walk-in"" closet like the master bedroom. The smallest bedroom is less than half the size of either room. No closet space. If you put a twin-sized bed in there, you'd take up about half the room.

We're moving in a day, I will be taking the Den. She has the Master Bedroom. The small bedroom has been discussed from going to private use to common use again. She hates the idea of splitting rent by private room use instead of 50/50 but once we have a better idea what we need and what that small bedroom's proper use will be, we'll continue from there. Other than that, the issue was mostly her boyfriend being there constantly that drove me up the wall and we're working on that aspect together. 

Thanks for your judgment."
"AITA for calling out a friend on her gluttony? | So we have this friend who, to put it politely, sucks the oxygen out of whatever room she is in. She talks loudly, rapidly and lengthily, makes every conversation about her, interrupts others, and one-ups people's stories. This is part of the problem. The other part is she is food obsessed. She has struggled with her weight and she often insists she doesn't want anything to eat but then fills her plate.

Recently we had her and her husband over for drinks, appetizers and hockey. We all gathered around the tv on the couch -- except for her. She sat on the floor next to the coffee table where the appetizers/snacks were and pulled up to it like she was sitting at a picnic table. She then started eating like it was her personal meal.

Her husband impassively sipped his beer and watched the game, seemingly oblivious. My wife has some sort of soft spot for her and tends to overlook her oftentimes rude behaviour. I sat there gawking at her for a moment or two, then said ""Hey, think you could save some for the rest of us?"" I meant it in good humour and thought I came across light hearted but she looked at me offended, as did my wife. The husband didn't say anything. 

Later, after they left, my wife gave me royal shit and said that I had clearly embarrassed her. She said I was mean for commenting on her eating knowing that she has had weight struggles in the past, and said it was not my place to say anything. I disagreed and said she was being rude, and, doubling down, said she drives me crazy with her constant talking and domination of conversations. This made my wife even more upset. Everything is awkward and uncomfortable. My wife feels I should apologize. I feel doing so would validate her boorishness. Am I the asshole?


**EDIT: I appreciate the comments and discussion this post has sparked. I think I know the answer. I am the asshole *not* for the *fact* of speaking up, but for the *manner* in which I spoke up. In retrospect, I agree my comment was inappropriate. I plan to apologize. Thanks, friends.**"
"WIBTA if I outed my atheist husband to his very religious mother? | My husband is the oldest of four siblings, and three of the four are atheists. All are adults. My husband and I are both 32 years old and have our own home and a toddler.

He became an atheist at about age 16, and when we met at age 18, his church attendance was spotty. I wound up dragging him out of bed on Sunday mornings and meeting him at home to drive to church together; not because I was religious (I was sort of ambiguous and still believed in souls and karma and whatnot), but because I wanted one more excuse to spend time with him, as well as trying evangelical church out in case I was simply bored of Catholic church.

Fast forward a couple years later, my husband and I spent a lot of time talking about religion, morality, faith, the paranormal, etc. He convinced me that there's nothing wrong with calling oneself an atheist, but still chose to keep it a secret from his evangelical parents, whom my husband swore would disown him.

I guess word got out that I was an atheist (but not my husband...probably because I was slightly less careful than he'd grown up to be). His mother has spent the last 10 years or so being passive aggressive to me, praising my husband for ""bringing me to church"" - which was actually my idea, telling me the day after we were engaged that I was ""very lucky to have such a godly husband."" 

She's apparently still under the impression that I came into her son's life and turned him into an atheist, when it's actually the reverse that's more true.

So we have a three year old daughter who's very receptive to people's emotions and I don't want her to pick up on the fact that I can't stand being around my very religious, anti-Muslim, xenophobic, homophobic, atheist-hating mother-in-law.

My husband - who is an independent adult - is still not comfortable with his parents knowing that he was an atheist first, although they've been told this but don't believe it. It seems like I'm stuck with them treating me rudely because he is afraid of nothing else other than them knowing this about him. 

WIBTA if I told my MIL that while my husband and I are both atheists, I didn't make him that way?


ETA: I don't think people are reading past the title...the only reason I would tell her that we're BOTH atheists but I didn't make him that way is so that she would treat me better.

It's also important to note that my husband supports this conversation to happen...he just doesn't want to be the one to say it to his parents. He would let me do the talking."
"AITA for researching my SIL and BIL online and finding out about their horrible financial/legal troubles? | Two years ago my BIL bought a truck, several months later him and SIL said they decided to “take it back to the dealership and get out of the loan.” I knew that’s not how it works at all, but I didn’t question them further because I didn’t really care. 

Fast forward to like a month ago. I found out that you can search criminal/civil records online since it’s public record, so in my free time I was looking up myself and people I know. I knew BIL was in jail last year for awhile, so I looked him up. 

I discovered that truck he “returned” was actually repossessed without a single payment being made. There were about 40 pages of legal documents I read through and learned that SIL co-signed and they had a ridiculous interest rate of 23%. I won’t go into more details but they got screwed badly on that deal. 

I did more digging and found that he had 1 other car repossessed 3 years ago, along with places like rent a center and payday loan companies suing both BIL and SIL over the years. His wages were garnished for years. I’m assuming they’re about to be garnished again, and for a long time.

SIL and BIL both posted angry/sad Facebook posts yesterday about how their lives suck and nothing ever goes right for them, and my wife asked her what happened. SIL said “nothing”. My wife said she knows about their financial situation and how much debt they’re in, debt they’ve ignored. Wife was concerned because of their daughter and didn’t want her to have to suffer due to her parents mistakes. They both only make $11 an hour so we don’t know how they’re going to handle it. My wife was pissed off about the whole thing because she hangs out with her sister a lot and sees her spending habits, and realized they’ve been blowing their checks on everything besides their debt despite having a child. 

SIL really flipped out and questioned how she knew, and when she told her what I did she said that I needed to quit being “so fucking nosy” and that it was none of my business, that “he shouldn’t fucking be looking up anything about us.” I haven’t told anyone but my wife what I found, and that was because I was just blown away. SIL and BIL had no idea you could find this info online so easily, so they never thought people would find out I guess. 

She blocked us on Facebook and posted statuses about us. some of my wife’s family members have been questioning us about it, wondering what happened and why we made her go on a rampage. Apparently she’s beyond furious and is talking shit about us to everybody. 

AITA for going out of my way to find out this info?"
"AITA for giving a bad recommendation my ex-boyfriend who ""found Jesus"" and dumped me for a woman? | Ex and I were going strong for a few years. We were soulmates - I was gonna ask him to marry me. His family didn't approve, of course, they didn't like the fact that their son was a ""fag"". Nevertheless I had in mind a future of marriage, starting a family, of living a long happy life with him. 

Then his bitch aunt died - the one who said that I was to blame for turning her nephew into a fairy. Turns out my comment about her having a sour cunt hit a little close to the mark - cervical cancer, age 56. He's devastated - they were close before he came out, however poorly she treated him afterward (I believe her exact words were ""go ahead and spit on Jesus' name, for all I care. You'll regret it in Hell."") He goes to the funeral alone (we decided that it would be best if I stayed away.) This was the first time he'd seen most of his family in a long while. 

When we started dating I was the first boyfriend he'd ever had. I defended him when his family turned on him. I helped him out of the slump that came after one by one his family stopped talking to him. He said I was the one who rescued him from pretending all the time. 

He went on a ""fishing trip"" with his father a few weeks later. Imagine my surprise, then, when I see his father across the street while he's supposedly gone. I don;t say anything, although later it turns out Ex was at one of those psychotic ""ex-gay"" retreats in the wilderness of bumfuck, Utah. He keeps disappearing, and I have no idea why, until finally he sits me down one day and tells me that he was ""having a phase,"" when he met me, and that he ""isn't the man he thought he was."" Turns out he was seeing some dry old cunt of a church lady who posed as a therapist, one of those conversion therapists. He dumps me and says that he's been seeing a woman who his parents picked out for him. 

We met at work, so a few weeks later I put in my two weeks and moved to another workplace across town so I could avoid him. Lo and behold it's two years later and he applies for a position at my work. My boss and I usually go over the new applicants together. I check to see if it's him and sure enough it is. My boss asks me what I think about him. I tell him that Ex was kind of a pill while I worked with him, that the other people found him ""difficult,"" because he couldn't take criticism. I make no mention of our previous relationship. I pull out another applicant's file and tell him I think she's a better fit for the job. My boss sends her an email giving her the good news later that day. 

To clarify, New Girl is eminently qualified. It's just that until I spoiled the process Ex was the top candidate. AITA?"
"AITA for saying my gf is a “wholesome chungus”? | Title explains itself. My girlfriend was being really funny and cute. I thought it was really holesome, so me being the r/dankememer that I am, I said she’s a wholesome chungus moment. She didn’t know what chungus meanT, so 𝗌𝗁𝖾 𝗅𝗈𝗈𝗄𝖾𝖽 𝗂𝗍 𝗎𝗉. 𝚂he saw the picture of big chungus, and thought I was calling her fat. So am AITA for saying my girlfriend is a wholesome chungus?"
"AITA for not paying an influencer after he demanded 100% payment up front with no contract? | I hired an influencer to promote my product a few weeks ago. Our agreement was for him to make an honest YouTube review of my product. However, after he received it he said he can’t recommend my product. So I asked him if he could send links to my product instead and he said yes. 

Here comes the tricky part. He claims he made a video of the negative review, although he never showed it to me. He then demanded that I pay him now for the negative review. I said, “I will pay you in full up front as soon as we sign a contract stating that you will post links to my product as we agreed earlier. That’s how most business dealings work.” He responded: “Don’t lecture me about how business deals work. Let me point out the flaw in your logic...again. We had a deal for $263 for an honest review, and I expect you to pay me for my hard work. Why is it so hard for you to understand this?” 

I said, “I’m sorry, but I really don’t feel comfortable paying you up front with no contract. Please see attached contract and let me know if you have any questions.” He said, “Since you refuse to pay me I will post the most negative review I can make for your product. Expect to see it soon.” I don’t respond well to threats, so I decided not to pay him. He has not responded to my emails since. 

AITA for not paying him?"
"AITA for banning my roommates from interacting with my pets? | Hiya Reddit! I made an account for the sole purpose of asking this so here we go!

I rent an apartment with 3 other people. They’re awesome and I have no qualms living with them except for this one thing.

I have a few guinea pigs in my room that are my beloved pets. They have a super cool custom enclosure that I designed myself. My roomies are cool with the piggies... a little too cool with them, actually!

My roommates had a bad habit of taking my guinea pigs out without permission. Sometimes I would come into my room to find one of my roomies hanging out with the pigs. Which is all fine and dandy, but it kinda bothered me that they didn’t ask me first. They would also take them out when I wasn’t home home or take them out to show guests.

I had no problem with my roommates wanting to interact with my pigs, but I wanted them to ask me first. I told them this and they didn’t really listen, and continued to play with my piggies without asking me. I asked them several more times to please not take the pigs out without asking or letting me know, especially when I wasn’t home. Didn’t work.

I decided to put my foot down. I now have a lock on my bedroom door and don’t let my roomies interact with my guinea pigs anymore. They started asking me politely if they could see them/started asking permission, but imo too little too late. I have effectively banned my roommates from seeing the guinea pigs.

My roommates are pissed and this has caused a huge rift between us. They are arguing that they “share” their pets (which is true — I frequently hang out with the cats in the household), and that they have a bond with my guinea pigs. They say it is unfair of me to ban them since 1) they now love the piggies and 2) they don’t ban me from playing with their pets.

I understand that my piggies are lovable but I had to put my foot down! I gave them the chance to just ask me and they didn’t respect that. 

My friend group has been calling me a jerk, saying I’m being rude and creating unnecessary drama, and they are siding with my roommates.

In retaliation, I am now banned from interacting with the cats in the house which sucks but whatever. 

My roomies and friends say I’m a grade A asshole and should lift the pig ban so that the house isn’t a tense dramafest but I’m not budging. It’s created such a horrible atmosphere in the apartment that being home sucks.

AITA, Reddit?"
"AITA for asking my girlfriend to at least shave her bikini line. | We both are females. She prefers to be natural. I never ever asked her to do anything. I respect her choices.

But last week we were planning to go to the beach. She wore her bikini but it looked so awkward with her pubic hair. I pointed that out to her and she got mad and we ended up cancelling our trip. It looked so gross and was likely to attract unwanted attention. 

Waa I wrong? AITA?

Edit: I was shitty and I'll apologise to her asap. Bless this sub."
"AITA for asking my girlfriend to pay for computer reparations? | A bit of backstory: I bought a gaming laptop (2.3k$) for myself around Christmas 2017 because I wanted to bring it to work from time to time when I had nothing to do and also bring it when I went to visit my family. I already owned a gaming PC at this point so I just kept using this when I was at my home. I visit my family four times a year and I started biking to work so I actually very very rarely bring it to work.

Anyways, my girlfriend really got into Overwatch and she started using  my laptop almost everyday. I'd say she used it for around 95% of the time this laptop has been used at all.

Now, the power supply needs replacement (after 1.5 years of course it's not under warranty lmao) and I asked her if she could gimme some money since she's the one who used it mostly. She told me that if I would've warned her she'd have to pay for maintenance, she just wouldn't have used it at all. She agreed to pay for 50% of the power supply but I think she should pay more because she's the one who's been using it all that time.

Edit: A power supply for that computer goes for around 150$CAD.

Edit2: Thanks to everyone for your answers. But here's something you need to think of too. I owned that other gaming PC for seven years and only threw in a new drive because I wanted a SSD, and upgraded my graphic card because I could. I never had to dish out any money to maintain it so I think it's unfair to tell me ""I should've given her ground rules for usage of my laptop"" like come on, this isn't Law & Order, it's a relationship with another person. I didn't think it would need reparations ever, she used it until it needed reparations. Now I'm an asshole for asking for her contribution? Like come on, I just didn't know.
If I never use my car and she'd use it 95% of the time, I would like her to pay for the upkeep as well, and I'd expect it to run fine when I want to use it.
How's this different?

TL;DR: AITA for asking my girlfriend to pay for repairs on my 2nd gaming PC that she's been using for 95% of its uptime?"
"AITA Shitty Balloons for rude kids and parents | During the weekends in the lead up to Christmas I have a side gig at a mall where I make balloon animals.

The mall pays me, it's not much but this is to clarify that I am not a volunteer. 

I've noticed that people are jerks. They just shout at me push to thr front and demand things off me.

So, here's what I have been doing. If someone is nice and uses their manners they get an amazing, intricate balloon that I put a lot of effort into.

If someone isn't nice they get a very subpar balloon that will pop or deflate quickly.

Most people today got shitty balloons.

Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for telling my parents that my sister vapes? | I am 18 and a HS senior, I have a 14yo freshman sister.  Like most freshman she finds vaping and all that shit the coolest thing, I have a vape that she knows about but I have never done it in front of her and its legal for me to do it while its not legal for her to do it.  Anyways I found out on her story on snapchat that she was vaping, I was kinda disappointed cause she shouldn't be doing that, when I was her age I waited till I was 18 cause I wasn't about to break a law.  I tried to talk with her to get her to stop and she basically just ignored me. 

2nd incident:She took MY vape out of my room, I found out cause my lock box had the key in it and only the vape and not my money or knife.  I went and got it back and warned her that if she does that again she will regret it.  She called me a fake tough asshole but whatever

3rd incident:I found out she flat out bought her own and did it IN MY CAR.  I didn't say that I know she did it but when me her and our parents were home I told our parents she is vaping.  She is now grounded for a couple months and they took away her vape.  They really can't do anything about mine cause I'm 18, pay rent and I never do it inside the house.  

My sister is pissed at me for snitching but I did warn her that she would regret it if she continued to do it.  I know I'm not the best role model for her cause I vape but I don't want her to do it, especially at her age cause that can cause serious damage cause she doesn't know moderation.  While I maybe take 2-3 hits a week.  

AITA here?"
"AITA For wanting to talk about animal rights with my Korean friend? | My friend and I were just on our way to breakfast, and I randomly asked her what animal rights were like in Korea. She then proceeded to tell me her grandad used to hunt to eat, survive. And I said, great, I completely get that. But what about nowadays? What do modern people think about hunting? And she got quite offended, like I was attacking her culture. She said that her friends and most people in Korea didn't really like talking about stuff like this and that it was a heavy subject. They usually talked about celebrities, and maybe they might talk about this kind of thing if it was trending on the news. She started to get really stressed out and started crying.

I get that maybe she didn't like talking about it, but for me, this kind of thing is important but has never been a heavy subject when I talked about it with others. It's like... a part of a person's values. But now I feel like I might have done something wrong? Or not? I literally can't figure it out.

Idk, AITA?"
"AITA for not liking my dads new and pregnant girlfriend? | So I am fifteen years old and female, for a bit of context, my dad packed up and left my mom with me in tow when I was five. I grew a strong relationship with my dad and it's great, I love my dad. Now onto what's bugging me. My dad recently started dating again and his girlfriend is pregnant. I was on the phone with my boyfriend when he told me and my boyfriend heard me lose my absolute shit. I was angry so I asked if this child was keeping their mom, before you say anything, I was not thinking at the time. He gave me a look that said yes they were and then he left. His girlfriend and I do not have any common interest and treats me like a pest most of the time. I told my dad this and he said that it will be fine and I'll get used to her, no I won't but okay dad. I want someone who cares for me, who says everything will be fine when it's not fine, I want my mommy to be quite honest. I guess my dad told his girlfriend this and she was PISSED. She started yelling that I was an ""ungrateful little bitch"" who ""cries for the attention not the hurt."" Bitch you threw a candle at my shoulder the other night cause I got you ice cream without peanuts. The only person who acts like they give a shit about me is my boyfriend and he's saying that it's normal to try and adjust and be upset. I was upset and I trashed a pillow she got me, on accident, I was punching it and then I started tearing it and I started getting more violent with it. I told him this and he thought it was the funniest shit ever.

I just want to know if I should try and give her another chance or if I should just give up. AITA for not wanting anything to do with her and my half-sibling? AITA for trashing the pillow? I need answers. (This was updated since my op got removed)

Edit: She just told me to break up with my boyfriend, apparently, he's too ""cute and charming"" to be seen with ""dirt"" like me, this is what I deal with on the way to school every morning."
"AITA for scolding an older woman who brought her ""service"" dog into the supermarket? | I was walking into a grocery store the other day and an elderly woman with a cute little fluffy dog on a leash with a red vest indicating it's a service animal is right in front of me. As soon as the dog walks through the door, it squats and urinates in the store. I start telling the lady in a very loud voice that is disgusting and that is exactly why dogs do not belong in grocery stores. She looks confused, so I point out that her dog just peed on the floor. She goes to the restroom and gets toilet tissue to clean up the mess, and I went off on her a bit, telling her hey, I have dogs and I would never think it was appropriate to bring them into a supermarket, and that real service animals wouldn't pee as soon as they walked through the door.

It was probably an emotional support animal, which imo does not belong in a store that sells food. Pet stores, hardware stores, fine, but not a grocery store. People who bring their pets into grocery stores and put them in the carts and wheel them around piss me off and I know the stores can't or won't ask about the necessity of a ""service"" animal. Now, if a German Shepherd is leading a blind guy around, or a service animal that detects when someone is going to have a seizure is in a store, that's one thing (they are trained, and don't pee in stores) but dammit, emotional support animals don't belong in food stores imo. This grocery store has delivery service if it is that stressful to go to the store that one needs emotional support. I was pretty loud and firm in addressing her, and she may have needed emotional support when I was done with her.

AITA for telling her off in front of other customers and store management? I also left the store and said that until they get policies in place to stop these abuses I wouldn't be coming back to shop."
"AITA for not letting managers buy me a cake for my birthday and depriving my coworkers of cake | At my work there's a tradition where the managers will buy a cake when it's someone's birthday, then the whole team has a little 'morning tea' and share the cake. I'm on one of those 8 week body transformation challenges right now where the diet is really strict. My birthday is next Monday and on Thursday the team assistant came over to ask what kind of cake I wanted. I said I don't want a cake because I'm on a diet. She looked a bit taken aback but was like 'okay' and went away.

Later that day two coworkers came up to me and basically said I should just ask for a cake anyway even if I don't want one so that everyone else can have it. Apparently this is what 'everyone else does' even if they dont want cake/they're on a diet etc. I said I don't really want to watch people eat cake on my birthday when I can't have any, but I'm happy for them to ask the managers for the money to buy cake for everyone else and I just won't come. Apparently managers said no to this and now everyone is mad because I deprived them of cake.

AITA? My friend said I should just go to the manager and say I changed my mind and ask for a cake. But I know I won't eat it, and also, I don't want to feel like I 'owe' them something for buying me a cake and spending money on me, when I don't want a cake."
"AITA for ignoring my cousin? | Ok, so, I’ll start with the most recent, my cousins baby boy was having his 1 year birthday, (it was last month) they were going to buy him a water/sand table for him, but it would have been shitty plastic quality, so I suggested we build him one, and customize it, I’d help and pitch in for supplies. We made a really nice big one, with a cherry red stain, and then I painted his name on it, happy birthday, the day of his birthday, and some other stencils like an aspen tree, (cause his name is aspen) various sports and what not. Turned out really good, and he uses it all the time. Well now without asking me, he has posted it on his Snapchat and Facebook, asking if anyone wants these custom water/sand tables he’d make them, he didn’t have a set price, didn’t price out materials/wood or labour, and he has a bunch of people that want them made, including a couple of daycares, and I simply don’t want to do that, he can’t do them himself, he can’t paint, I used my own paint as well, and I did most of the measurements and cutting, I did it for his son, cause his son is so damn cute, and I love him! But I don’t want to do others, it’s not something I’m interested in, but he has so many orders from people, so I’ve been ignoring him, I don’t want to deal with it, I have a hard time saying no, and he’ll try to rope me into helping him, cause he’ll say “want to come over in a bit and play some games!” Which I’m down most of the time so I’ll say yes, and like I’ll get there and he’ll say oh we can’t play games tonight (girlfriend) is sleeping, but we can go do (whatever job) it is, so I have stopped talking to him, I’ll open his snaps once in awhile and never respond cause it’s the same bullshit, but now he’s saying I’m an asshole for ignoring him, or not coming over to see Aspen, and I’m letting all the daycares and people down by not making them. Which I think is stupid, mind you this cousin also owes me at least $5000 and a $2500 vehicle. He’s not my favourite cousin, I just love his baby and have a hard time saying no."
"AITA for being mad that my girlfriend won't go to my co-workers wedding with me? | Me (25m) has been dating Mary (23f) for just over three years. We've attended two weddings in the past year, my cousins and her childhood friends. 

Both events required travel, which I paid for, but I a make more money, so I usually pay for the extra expenditures.

So, when I surprisingly got a wedding invitation from a coworker that I am not all that close with, I just assumed Mary would be going. It is in our city, we are available, and it's an open bar...why not?

However, when responding to the RSVP, Mary was surprised that I wanted to go because I didn't know my coworker that well. I gave her the reasons I gave above, big emphasis on the free party, and she didn't seem convinced.

I explained that she had spoken to them about their wedding and given them some advice, as she previously worked in the wedding industry, so the likely invited us to be polite. I think we should respond to the kind gesture, with the gesture of at least showing up to the event. They didn't need to invite us, but they did anyways.

Then she let me know that I could go, but she wouldn't be going. I was confused at her refusal to go, and this obviously led to a somewhat civil argument.

I complained that I went to her friends wedding in her home state, and paid for the entire trip - which included an Airbnb, rental car, food, and airfare. The least she could do is to to my co-workers wedding.

She complained that she doesn't like social events and would rather not go because she won't know anyone, so she won't have fun.

I explained, I believe that is how some weddings are for significant others and it is kind of part of the gig of being in a relationship.

She said that she just didn't want to go and didn't think it would be a big deal for us to do our own thing.

It went on like this for a few more back and forths. There were some personal remarks, but nothing earth shattering - just some  common domestic argument bs.

It ended with her saying that if I cared so much, she would go and me being petty by replying with ""whatever, I'll go by myself."" Now she's gone to bed and I am typing this.

So Reddit, AITA for thinking my girlfriend would go to my co-workers wedding with me?"
"WIBTA for setting my friend up, so he has to give me a wedding gift? | I know it sounds like I'm an entitled bitch, but please hear the entire story.

My wedding was over a month ago, and husband and I didn't want people to spend money on us, we didn't put a wedding gift list,and to the people who asked what to give us, we told them there would be a box at the reception for them to put cards and some cash if they wanted to (we're living abroad and traveled to have the wedding at home, so it wasn't easy for us to receive gifts), but the amount we asked for was what their granny would give them for a 10th birthday. 

Now to my friend, I've known him for +15 years, he's pretty well off and has the annoying antic of bragging about how generous he is with his friends in a way that makes it looks like you're some kind of gold digger. The thing is, the expensive gifts he brags about never arrives. So he'll brag about how he's gonna pay for your vacations and never does it. I've NEVER expected to get anything from him, and when this happens, I usually nod and smile awkwardly. Btw, he's lost friends because of this.

At my wedding, he mentions SEVERAL times how his gift is going to pay for our move to Europe next year (husband and I want to pursue our master's there), he specially did it in front of my in-laws and husband's family. It got to the point where husband's cousins asked him if he knew I was a gold digger (I'm not). Anyways, as I expected, there is no gift from my friend.

I texted him the next day thanking him for attending. He mentions how he ""forgot"" to give me his ""big check"" (his words). I tell him I'll be there for a few more days before going back to my duty station and we can meet but he says he'll be very busy. I then mention he can drop his gift at my mom's house, but he says he wants to see my face when I see it, as it's the BIGGEST gift he's ever gave me (for the record, he has never gave me anything more than an ice cream invitation on my birthdays).

Fast forward to last week, I'm back home for work stuff and we met. He didn't say anything about the gift. I honestly don't give a crap about the gift itself, but I think he crossed a line with what he did at my wedding and I should teach him a lesson by putting him in a situation in which he *has* to give me the gift he bragged about, or admit he didn't intend to give me anything and apologize for how uncomfortable he made me feel.

Husband thinks that's an asshole move, bc we're not entitled to any gift, and I should just let it go, but cut ties w him. So WIBTA for setting my friend up, so he has to give me a wedding gift?

EDIT explaining the set up: I basically thought about meeting with him and other friends we have in common next time I'm home, and casually mention how thanks to xxx gift we were able to buy a coffee machine in the country we're currently living in. I know he'll take the bait and brag (specially bc he's done it before but I've said nothing). In that moment, I'll say he didn't gave me anything, thus forcing him to admit he didn't plan to give anything or just give me what he bragged about out of embarrassment, knowing I won't stay quiet if he dares to brag about it again.

Btw, the friends I'd be meeting, know about this shitty behavior."
"AITA for not liking the car my parents bought for me? | So far everyone in my family is calling me ungrateful and an asshole.

My parents recently bought me an early 2000  Toyota Camry as my ""first"" car for college. I thanked them for the car, but I asked if I can trade it for my mom's 2009 VW Jetta. And I was told no. 

The reason why I want my mom's Jetta is because I repaired the car with the help of my dad after it was in a severe collision. We spent years fixing the car so that I can drive it for myself. The Jetta is special to me because made it a father/son project that we were proud of. 

Fast forward to the present, and I am pleading with my parents to give me the Jetta. But my parents are standing their ground with the only reason why I can't keep it is because it's too fast. 

Now they're calling me ungrateful because I am not appreciating a gift I got from them for college, and that I'm not going to get the Jetta under any reason. I ask my brother for his opinion and he is siding with my parents, so it's a 3/4 opinion against me. 

Am I the asshole?

INFO: we are in the process of getting licence plates and the smog check for the Camry, so in the meantime I'm using the Jetta to drive myself where I need to go. After the Camry is done I will lose the ability to use the Jetta.

Edit: I was the one who bought the Jetta."
"AITA for being upset that my husband didn't tell me about his friend's death until hours before the funeral? | My husband told me this morning that his friend had died and his funeral was today. He had apparently known about it for several days, in fact his cousin who was also friends with the deceased came into town for the funeral. I personally did not know his late friend, nor have I ever met him, thus was not invited to the funeral (and I'm ok with that) nor had any intention of attending it (which he is ok with).  


I voiced to my husband that it upset me that he didn't talk to me about it, thus had been internalizing the loss alone for days. He said he understood, but that he didn't feel like it was necessary, and though they were friends, they ""weren't that close"". But when I called him after the funeral (I am at work) to see how he is doing, he started off saying he was fine but then ranted for 15-20 minutes about how it's ""stupid"" and ""unfair"" that his friend died, especially with the manner of which he died (OD on Fentanyl). I stayed calm and caring over the phone and didn't mention my annoyance again to him while he was talking so that he could get his feelings out, but I feel like an asshole cause the entire time he was ranting I couldn't help but think ""He could have told me when he found out and he would have been already processing all this before now"" and ""this is what I was telling him about this morning, he shouldn't have pretty much hid it from me cause i could have been helping him""  


AITA or am i just Overthinking all of it?"
"AITA for having kept my daughter home on school's mandatory ""culture day trip""`? | My daughter, 8, goes to a primary school, where school classes do a mandatory day long trip once in 3rd grade, where they visit several religious worship places (church, mosque, synagogue) to participate in each praying session and tell them about each religion. They call it ""cultural enrichment"", I think it's indoctrination. I want to raise my daughter irreligiously, because I think that all religions are very dangerous and there are a lot of scandals around each religion. Later when she is grown up, she can decide on her own if she wants to be religious. So I told the school that my daughter was sick and kept her home. A few days later on our bi-monthly parent-teacher meetings, her teacher went on a rant. That's when I heard that only 11 out of the 24 children went on this trip. She accused us parents of promoting hatred and raising our children to be intolerant. Several parents got angry and told her that it's not the school's job to teach their children about religion and although I didn't raise my voice, I think the same. I personally see myself in the right and I'm shocked that this school forces them to go on such a trip, but I'm curious if others think of this as an asshole move."
"AITA for ""forcing"" a nurse to watch our baby? | My husband and I are in another city away from home and staying at a RMHC while our son is in the hospital. He's 1 and had open heart surgery two weeks ago. He's recovering well but developed a complication which means our stay is likely going to be at least another week.

So far we've been staying in the hospital room and only making occassional trips to the RMHC, mostly to restock on diapers, formula, etc. The nurses advise this but it's not a rule. We wake up every 3-4hr to feed/change but otherwise we're not doing much. Sometimes my husband goes out for Starbucks or food and brings some back.

I'm not gonna lie, this is exceedingly boring and cramped. The hospital room, after you remove my son's bed, is like 5ft by 10ft. My husband sleeps in a chair and I sleep on the couch.

Last night we decided to sleep at the RMHC, leaving our son in the full care of the nurses in the ward. We got dirty looks when we announced this, and there were no longer any pleasantries when we returned. We just wanted a nice sleep, and we got one. We want to do this more but we feel guilty.

I guess typically parents stay in the room the whole time, and nurses only come in to change IV, do tests, etc. They will change/feed if needed but we've been told this is rare. I want to reiterate this is their job, it's just most parents prefer to do it themselves. We want the break and unfortunately this means extra work for our nurse (who is probably tending to a dozen plus other children).

Are we the assholes?"
"AITA for immediately vetoing a name my wife wants for our son, based on one of her coworkers? | My wife is in her last trimester and we are talking about names a lot these days. We had about 4 solid options going (varying from my father's middle name, her grandfather's name, and 2 that we just liked the sound of) and now there is a 5th one thrown in as a serious contender from my wife's side. She likes the name ""Nate"" because of a coworker ""Nathan"" she is especially close to (not the actual name.) There had been some drama at her workplace in which Nathan had her back, protected and defended her. They aren't friends outside of work but close at the office. I have met Nathan at holiday parties and he is a good guy. I don't have any problem with him - but I don't want our son to be named after him. To be 100% honest, I vetoed it almost immediately and my wife got annoyed with me. When I told her I just don't want our son to be associated with a work friend, she said that this was an important person to her. I asked her if she would be okay with naming a daughter after ""Alyssa,"" my coworker? And she said that it was different because Alyssa and I are just close work buddies, but Nate and her have been through some serious shit together. We didn't argue about it and I also didn't want to upset her too much (last trimester and all...) so I just said I'll think about it.

But in my heart, I don't even want to consider the name, even though I can tell that it is bothering her. AITA for shutting it down so quickly? Does ""Nate"" deserve a chance in the pool?"
"AITA For being upset that my wife got the same tattoo in the same spot? | I have been a public defender for 5 years. I have always wanted to be a public defender due to some experiences growing up. In light of this, about 2 years in to my career I got a tattoo of the booking photo of a man by the name of Clarence Earl Gideon. This is the man behind the Supreme Court case that made it a constitutional right to have appointed counsel when being charged with a crime when you cannot afford to hire your own.

I met my wife 3 years ago. Shortly after getting the tattoo. At the time, my wife had been a prosecutor for 5 years. She had never been a defense attorney/public defender. Eventually we were both offered jobs at a public defender office in a different county. We both accepted. We both are currently employed as public defenders. We also have a 9 month old boy that we named Gideon. We live paycheck to paycheck on our crap salaries.

A couple weeks ago my wife brought up the fact that she wanted to get a tattoo of Gideon's booking photo, like mine, but by a better tattoo artist than did mine. I expressed how it made me feel. She admitted that she would be upset as well if the roles were reversed. Despite this, yesterday she had the tattoo done. It is by far the biggest tattoo she has ever gotten, and highly visible. I went with her and tried to remain supportive. I understand that this is a silly human emotion that I shouldn't let effect our relationship. I tried to put aside my feelings but I am really struggling today.

AITA for being upset that my wife got a better version of a tattoo in the same spot as me? Especially in light of the fact that she had been pro-prosecution her entire life until meeting me? Also due to our financial situation I found it highly irresponsible to spend $600 dollars on a tattoo. AITA?"
"AITA for forcing my girlfriend to embarrass herself. | throwaway as my girlfriend uses reddit. 
I'm 24m girlfriend is 24

around a week ago my mum called me and asked if we wanted to host my grandmother's 90th birthday, me and my girlfriend agreed. I offered to make the cake as I really wanted a reason to bake a rainbow cake. I thought I did a pretty good job and added ""happy birthday jan"" (fake name) with icing on top. I send a photo of it to my mum and she loved it. 

the night of the party my girlfriend went out to celebrate a friend getting a promotion, I let her go as I cant force her to stay. I just added that I would like her to not be hungover at my grandmother's birthday party, she agreed. 

turns out that her and her 2 friends came home drunk, my girlfriend then decided to let them eat the cake and make a huge mess.

I woke up to find my girlfriend asleep on the couch with cake smeared everywhere, I managed to vacuum the floor and ""clean"" the couch, I added a blanket over it to hide the cake stains. 

I then had to run to the store and get a cheap cake, boy was I mad. 

my girlfriend was also super hungover. 

I decided to wake my girlfriend up and force her to call my mum and tell her exactly what she did, my mum was not pleased and I really embarrassed my girlfriend. she has not come home and missed the party (not that anyone cared tbh)  my grandmother was thankful for the cake but would if wanted my one. 

I got my girlfriend to tell my mum that she got so drunk that she ruined the cake that (boyfriend) made for his grandmother, she also apologized. 

AITA?"
"AITA for only allowing my daughter to go to a concert if she brings my son as well? | My son’s favourite band announced a concert in our city a few days ago, and he’s been begging me to let him to go ever since. He’s only 15 and I don’t feel comfortable with him going unaccompanied as there’s almost definitely going to be a drinking/drug environment at this concert. The tickets also say that children must be accompanied by somebody over the age of 16. I already know I won’t be able to take him as I’m attending a wedding that weekend. However, he LOVES this band, and I know it would make his year to be allowed to go. 

Last night my daughter (17) also decided she also wanted to go as a group of her friends are planning on attending. I had a bit of a brainwave - my daughter could go with her friends and just keep an eye on my son as well. I figured I’d get a ticket for my son’s friend who loves the band as well so that they could stick together and just stand near my daughter and her group. They’re only 18 months apart so my daughter’s friends all get on well with my son as well. 

My daughter did NOT respond well to this offer - she doesn’t think she should have to “babysit” while she’s having fun with her friends and screamed at me for even suggesting it. I’m not asking her to hold his hand for the full concert, I just think if I’m buying her a ticket that she can keep an eye on her brother during it. Him bringing a friend would make him less dependent on her but I don’t think it’d be an issue with her friend group either as they all get along quite well. 

I’ve told my daughter that the only way I’ll get her a ticket is to take her brother and his friend and she said “over my dead body”. My son doesn’t care about going with his sister, he’s just so excited to even get to go.

AITA here? Both kids want to go and I can’t take my son myself or I definitely would. My son can’t go without somebody over the age of 16 accompanying him. I feel like it’s a fair compromise but my daughter thinks I’m an asshole for forcing my son’s presence on her. He’s going to be so excited for the band he won’t have the time to annoy her in my opinion, so I think she’s really being entitled and unfair when I’m the one shelling out for the ticket in the first place. What do you think?"
"WIBTA If i refused to empty the bin used for pads and tampons? | I know that sounds bad, but let me elaborate. 

So at my house, mum and sister both put their used tampons and pads in the bin next to the toilet, and it only gets emptied when it's full, so it stinks. I am the one who has to do it even though I never use it. So, would I be the asshole it I refused to empty it? BTW I'm a guy"
"AITA for having a massive problem with fireworks in my neighborhood? | As background, I have dogs that are terrified of loud noises, and I have a sensory issue with loud sudden noises that causes significant discomfort.

- Our neighborhood is on the outskirts of town. It is legal to discharge fireworks here.

- Our neighborhood is under an HOA, which forbids fireworks.

- Our neighbors throughout the neighborhood literally set off thousands of fireworks. We’re not talking the little stuff. We’re talking nice professional quality fireworks.

- This is the suburbs, and there is very little space between houses. The fireworks were set off in driveways  and in the streets. Cleanup was attempted, but not thorough. I have several components of expended fireworks now littering my yard.

The drama here starts as so many do on Facebook. My wife made a post lamenting the fireworks in the neighborhood. We were told it’s normal around here and that we should have done our research and avoided the area if it was a problem. In our defense, we read through the HOA agreement, saw they were banned, and didn’t worry about it.

My concern is selfish. I hate having my animals scared shitless, I would like to sleep in a way that supports my odd schedule, and I have severe discomfort around loud noises due to a neurological issue. I feel like I should be able to remain relatively safe from things in my home, but the fireworks in the street in front of and behind my house made this impossible.

In addition, it pisses me off that we have several severely autistic kids in our large neighborhood, as well as a ton of veterans. A couple of whom definitely suffer PTSD, though I don’t know the specifics.

The Facebook comments became quite rude, telling us to “fucking leave if we don’t like it,” and to “quit being pussies and enjoy the holiday.” The death threats were obviously a joke, but not appreciated.

After reading through pages of comments, I made the (what I believed to be obviously tongue-in-cheek) comment (pulling from memory here) “I am glad to see so many people are so welcoming of loud noises in the neighborhood. Since it’s not technically illegal, I’m sure they wouldn’t have a problem with me setting up a shooting target in my back yard or hunting the deer and pig around the edges of the neighborhood. Who has an empty grill? I’ll bring the meat!”

I realized this could be taken wrong and deleted it less than a minute later. Someone then paraphrased it completely wrong saying I said I was going to start shooting in the neighborhood, and someone else asked them to send a report to the police. I actually wish I hadn’t deleted the comment now so that anyone interested could see exactly what was said instead of relying on the memory of someone that wants me out of the neighborhood.

I absolutely shouldn’t have engaged, and I really wish my wife hadn’t started it on Facebook, but am I the asshole here? It seems the entire community page thinks we should be kicked out of our house for saying no one should set off fireworks inside the neighborhood."
"WIBTA if I told an acquaintance they smelled bad and needed to take care of their personal hygeine? | Let me start by saying over the years I (35f)have smelled some pretty rank ripe things. I'm talking burn pits in Afghanistan, people (including myself) in the field for weeks with no showers it's so bad you don't even want to get into the sleep system at night with yourself for fear your own odor will suffocate you in your sleep, dirty diarrhea diapers that as a mom you're wondering how exactly it managed to go up their backs, basically the worst smell you can imagine and never have I ever almost thrown up. That was a true statement up until this last month. 

I just started getting into DnD my BF has always been really into it so I thought wtf why not. And so far I'm actually having a lot of fun or would be if it wasn't for one of our players we will call Ben. Ben (24m) is a nice enough kid, but Ben stinks really bad. Every time he has come to a game he has reeked. When he has sat next to me I've physically gagged from the smell and gotten up to move to try to be nice I would say I wanted to sit next to my BF who is the DM. 

I feel bad partly because Ben is overweight and extremely emotionally sensitive. The slightest reproof makes him tear up which admittedly I'm not used this reaction at all. We've played together now for the last four weeks and no one has said anything to him, even though he smells like he took a bath in septic tank juice in the middle of July in a Louisianna swamp. Again I feel bad for the guy but I can't spend two hours trying to hold down what I've eaten all day and actually enjoy the game. 

So I thought if he comes to the next game I'm going to pull him off to the side and tell him he really needs to start showering or something before he comes because his poor hygiene is affecting others and not just himself. Of course, I won't say it exactly like that but something along those lines once I figure out how to say it. 

I've spoken to my BF about it and though agrees Ben stinks, he thinks I shouldn't say anything because I can be way too blunt. That it might create a feeling of being singled out for Ben. And that if it ended up with him feeling ostracised and quitting the game in which case I would be a real AH. His solution is just not to sit by him and let one of his friends tell him. But in my mind they haven't said anything before now they probably won't for the sake of feelings. And the smell permeates the entire area there is no escaping it. Basically, I'm doing him a favor in my book but maybe I'm wrong. WIBTA?"
"AITA for telling a girl I'll go back to her place and then ditching her? | I (19M) am a virgin and at uni and there's one girl we can call Georgie (19F) and for some reason, she really likes me. 

She put the moves on me and even kissed me but I never made more moves. One of her friends (19F) even said to me ""You realise she wants to fuck you?"". 

Well we went to a nightclub and she kept grinding all over me. Then we started talking and she asked me to come to her place after, in fact she begged me and wanted me to ""she her room"". 

I told her of course I would. But then I excused myself to the toilet. Since I was in VIP it was a fancy toilet so I went to the cubicle and sat on the toilet and began having serious anxiety at the thought of going to her place.

""Oh my god we're going to be naked and touching each other"" 

This thought entered my mind and terrified me to no end. ""What do I do when I go back to hers?"" Again the to he error came. I started shaking and sweating a lot. 

So I just left the toilet and ran home. Woke up to loads of texts calling me asshole. AITA?"
"AITA for sponsoring my daughter’s breast augmentation surgery? | My daughter got the surgery back in May, but since I’m her dad, this topic isn’t brought up often to me in my conversations. My oldest children are boy girl twins. Since they were such great kids and got into prestigious universities, my wife and I wanted to reward them with any present they wanted as their graduation gift. My oldest son asked for a used car and my daughter asked for a breast augmentation surgery. We bought our son a used Audi A4 for about the same price as what my daughter’s surgery costed. The thing is, they didn’t turn 18 until November so my daughter needed parental consent to have the surgery, and even then, it was difficult to find a surgeon who would operate on her because she didn’t have a deformity. My wife and I both knew she was mature enough to handle the consequences of the surgery. 


Like I said, since I’m her dad, it’s incredibly rare for people to talk to me about this topic. Sometimes they’ll talk about it when I’m with my wife, but mostly I hear about what people have to say from my wife. Initially when family and close friends found out, it was somewhat controversial. Most didn’t see anything wrong with what my daughter wanted or with the necessary permission we gave her. Some thought we shouldn’t have supported her decision because she was too young to make an intelligent, informed decision, or that she was still growing into her body. To those respectful yet doubtful people, my wife and I just say that we know our daughter is mature enough for every facet of the procedure. 


My whole family is on a trip to my birth country. We visited my sister and her family today. She was one of those respectful yet doubtful family members. However yesterday upon seeing my daughter for the first time after her surgery, my sister asked my daughter if she thought she went too big. My daughter said they turned out a little bigger than she had expected and for some reason her breasts have finally decided to start growing on their own in the past few months, but she doesn’t regret anything. My sister then told my wife and I that these were the reasons why I shouldn’t have let her get the surgery. She said my daughter didn’t make the right choice for the size of her implants because she was too young and immature and her natural breast tissue hasn’t ceased growing yet, so the size now is much different than what my daughter had intended. Before either my wife or I could say anything, my daughter shut my sister down by saying she has zero issues with how her breasts look and wished my sister wouldn’t rain on her parade. After a brief moment of awkwardness, we got on better footing."
"AITA for going wedding dress shopping without my mom? | I feel really bad about this but I don't know if I actually did anything wrong.

I live in a pretty rural area in the Midwest, and my mom lives on the West Coast, so all our conversations about my upcoming wedding this fall have taken place via text and phone calls. It's been hard not having her here, but she's planning to fly out for a whole week before the wedding to help me with some last-minute things, which I really appreciate.

My best friend and my  my fiance's mom both live in the same city and offered to come shop for wedding dresses with me last weekend. I had a really fun time with them, and I found the perfect dress at the fourth store we visited. 

My mom was the first person I sent photos of the dress I picked. She took a while to respond, but she eventually wrote back that she loved my choice of dress but she was extremely hurt that I hadn't invited her and that she had missed out on the experience. She said she would have found a way to make it, and she was particularly upset that my fiance's mom had been there when she hadn't.

The reason I didn't invite her was that I didn't think it would make sense for her to spend hundreds of dollars on flights and a hotel room (she has some back issues that prevent her from sleeping on my couch) just to watch me try on dresses. She's already spending a lot of money to fly out later this fall. She had also never specifically stated that she wanted to go wedding dress shopping with me at any point during any of our conversations about the wedding.

AITA?"
"AITA for telling my estranged daughter that financing her college education and giving her graduation presents was not an attempt to reconcile with her and walking out of a surprise party she threw for me? | I'm not American. Pardon my English.

I had my eldest daughter at 16 with my high school girlfriend who was 19. I wanted to have a family anf yes, I was really dumb.

We  got married really young, but we got divorced because I found out that she was sleeping another man who was much older. He had the money, I was not financially secure. She got custody and I got visitation. This continued for a while, but he had the money to pamper my daughter and my finances were not that great. By the time she was 14, idk what happened, but my daughter opted for optional visitation. It simply meant that I could only see her if she wanted to see me. That never happened. 

Around that time, I was just starting to do well for myself and I decided to move away because I could no longer take it. I had to accept the fact that she didn't want to see. I tried to contact my ex for information and pictures but I was simply told that I was infringing on their privacy. Eventually I gave up and I moved on.

I just understood that I had to be financially strong. I concentrated on my real estate business that and I did really well for myself. It's been years now and I'm really happy. I own a very successful real estate firm and I'm married now with a daughter. I owe everything to my wife and my best friend who were really supportive. 

When my eldest daughter was starting college, my ex contacted me and told me that she was divorced. She asked me if I would help with my daughter's college expenses. I gladly helped because I no longer had any financial woes. I also gave her a graduation present ( a lump sum to get her started ). 

So she surprised me with a party yesterday. And she was there. She's 25 now. 25. We had a chat. She apparently missed me so much. She was sorry and she never knew that the money came from me. I call bullshit on that. I told her it was not an attempt to reconcile and I was only doing my duty and walked out. 

Wife tells me that my daughter deserved a chance and I had to take the high road. But it's just too much for me. It's beyond repair and serves no purpose. AITA here.

Edit: Someone messaged me asking to mention when my daughter graduated. She graduated when she was 22.

Edit2: This is not about my daughter wanting money from me. And I personally don't think that she's only doing this because I'm well off now, because my firm is well known where I live and it's not a secret she just stumbled upon. It's just that I've missed her ENTIRE CHILDHOOD. What is there to do now. I have no memories with my daughter. And I don't know if it changes much now.

Edit3: Party was father's day stuff with family."
"AITA for not wanting my boyfriend's dead brother's dog? | My [f28] boyfriend's [m32] brother passed away from cancer at the beginning of December. It's been a very hard month for everyone involved, especially my bf, H, who was very close to his brother.

Shortly after the diagnoses, the brother started living with his parents. His mom has wanted a dog for ages and brother needed a reason to get out of bed, so H encouraged them to get one as a support animal + keep his mom company after his passing. My bf and I agreed to take the dog in the future as a last resort if his mom wanted to give it up to a shelter. We made this agreement on the basis they were adopting a senior dog.

Instead, they got a rambunctious, 8wk puppy from from Kijiji. It's everything we don't want in a dog - small, medium hair, female, high energy. We were furious. This was not the agreement. We retracted our offer to take the dog.

Fast forward close to brother's death. Mom has realised a puppy is a lot of work and doesn't want it anymore. Dog is roughly 14mo at this point. She asks us, ""so you're going to take it, right?"" We say no. We have been looking at getting our own dog and feel no bond or desire for the one she bought.

Then the brother died. In the days before his death, he begged the family to take care of his dog. Mom still doesn't want the dog, so now it's on our shoulders to take it in. H, who previously said he didn't want the dog, now feels honour bound to take it. He also wants his brother back, and the dog is the closest thing he has - but doesn't actually want the dog. It's an emotional mess.

Because H said he will take the dog now, the only thing holding us back from actually adopting her is me. I feel an immense amount of pressure and honestly, anger. The thing with this dog, everyone knows it to be brother's dog. It's will never be ""our"" dog. Then there's the shallow side - I think she's ugly. Our situation also has me, not H, looking after the dog 80% of the time. 

This is serious enough in my mind that I question our 3 year relationship and talks of getting engaged. Neither of us want children, but we do want a dog. We can only handle/house one dog at this time.

WIBTA if I said no to taking in and raising a dog for the next 10 to 15 years, when she has a large emotional worth to his side of the family? I feel like I would be. But I also feel ripped to shreds every time I think about taking her in.

Last note, we are both in therapy for grief counselling and personal help.

Edit: Y'all are making me laugh, getting so hung up on the word ugly and thinking that's my sole decision maker. It's like everyone thinks every dog is a precious little angel and you've never thought a certain breed was funky looking. She is an Aussie/terrier mix, since someone requested I put the breed in the main post. 

You also gloss over that NEITHER of us wanted the dog from the start and we stayed fairly vocal about that throughout. That opinion didn't change until brother begged his family to take care of dog and H knew his mom wasn't happy with her; brother was kept very unaware of the fact his mother didn't want to keep the dog. He died assuming she would keep it and was excited for his dog to play with the dog we got in the future. 

For those who gave genuine advice, both good and bad, thank you. I've been given stuff to think about."
"AITA for getting an RA? | So I stayed at my friend’s (A) college dorm when I was visiting to get travel visa. 


Her roommate had guests over and there was no space, so I slept at her friend’s (B)’s dorm (2 nights). However, when A’s roommate’s guests left, I decided to stay one more night in B’s room partially because I was too lazy to move and partially because A and her roommate were sick. 


This morning, I accidentally locked myself out of B’s room while both B and her roommate were in class. However, I had to go to my visa appointment and left my documents in B’s room. 


I didn’t want to miss my appointment because the reason I came to this city was to get a visa; and since B wouldn’t be back until later, I called an RA to open the door for me so I could get my documents


Now, B seems annoyed/mad that I called the RA and got into the room without asking her. 


Sidenote: Me and A tricked the RA into opening B’s door by saying A is a resident of B’s room and got locked out. A lives 3 doors down of B."
"AITA if I don’t pay rent after moving out? | I’ve been living with my roommates for about 2 years now. It’s three of us in one apartment, and rent is 1500 dollars a month. I’m going to give a little background and then get to the problem. 

Background: 
Everything was going well, until one of my roommates got a dog without running it by any of us. It was a rescue, and it was not trained at all... for example it peed and pooped in the house EVERY. DAY. It would get into EVERYTHING, destroy it and rip it to shreds. Also, this roomate worked second shift and would leave the house at 2am... the dog howled and barked continuously until one of the other roommates (usually me) woke up to get it. I’m a student and don’t have class until 11am, and I usually stay up pretty late gaming or watching TV so I’ve been getting almost no sleep. I’d continue to try and work this out with said roomate but never got a sympathetic response, just “try giving her treats” or “buy earplugs”.

Also, the house is disgusting. My roommates do not clean. Dishes are stacked, the bathroom is disgusting, I stopped using the shower completely and started using the one at my SO’s place. I started buying disposable dish wear so I stopped feeling like doing every song dish after two years. Whenever I brought this up to them, they just shrugged and said it’s not that bad/they’d get to it soon/another lame excuse. 
 
The problem: 
I moved out. I decided I had enough and my SO and I got a place together. I ran it past them, they said it was cool, and found another person to take my place, and I successfully moved everything out. 

Now, the person that said they would move in backed out and rent is due in a few days. They keep messaging me expecting to pay, but I literally don’t have an item there anymore and we had agreed I could move out. WIBTA if I refused to pay rent even though I’m on the lease? Or am I well within my means to refuse and make them split the 500 until they find someone to replace me? "
"AITA for being upset that my boyfriend told his family how much I am going to make? | Recently got hired at a new place where I will be utilizing my degree. I graduated mid December and started looking for jobs mid January. I got an email, called for an interview, got interviewed and got job offer 2 weeks later. Was super excited because this was my first choice.

I called my boyfriend to let him know. I was so excited, I told him everything, my start date, my salary. I get a text from a family member of his congratulating me. Awesome. I immediately text him not to disclose how much I will be making. Too late, he already has. I am bothered and annoyed, upset even. 

I tell him that is personal information. That everyone knows you don't disclose your salary, especially the salary of someone else. I am upset. I cancel plans to see him. He says he was asked and answered because he was excited for me and bragging. I try not to be upset but I still am. We make plans for the next day. 

I know once I see him I will react and get angry. I decide to cancel ahead of time and make plans for a different day. He's understandably upset. 

Am I the ass for being mad and canceling? Maybe I will get over it later, but in my opinion it shouldnt have been asked and he shouldnt have given my salary.


Edit: Thanks for your words of wisdom everyone we are doing great. It was interesting learning how speaking about salaries varies in cultures. We saw each other today and I discussed how I felt after hugging and talking about other things. It was a quick discussion and he apologized for disclosing. I let him know its wasn't his fault and I should have mentioned it to him before hand. I apologized for canceling, but he understood how I felt. We had a great dinner out to celebrate."
"AITA for telling a girl that likes me that I am gay so she will leave me alone | So I am 18(M) and going to college. This girl in my Chem class seems to be obsessed with me and keeps trying to talk to me. I kept dropping hints that were super obvious that I'm not interested. I just want to get my studies done quick so that I can move out and get a job. Today she told me she likes me and we should go out. In the heat of the moment I told her I was gay(I'm straight) and there was some people around that heard. I thought this was the best way to shut her down without making it embarrassing, but it might have been worse than just saying no. AITA?

TLDR: girl asks me on date. I tell her I'm gay to avoid a relationship"
"WIBTA if I do the following... | Quick backstory: I’m adopted. When I was 16 I met my biological mom. When I was 17 she told me she was pregnant and asked if I wanted “it”. A few days after I turned 18 she birthed my sister. Being 18 I did not feel comfortable taking on a newborn, especially as the sole caregiver; so I had to pass on raising my sister. She was adopted out to her biological dads sister. It was an open adoption.  Before my sister was 4, both her dad and our mom were dead. Her adoptive mother decided at that point that she was not going to tell her she’s adopted and that none of the family can see her. At our moms funeral I met 2 other sisters I had never met, and another brother. Our youngest brother was also there, but I had already met him. Sadly, we have another brother who passed away at 10, and 2 more siblings who are as lost as can be. (Police reports say they suspect that our mother sold those two on the black market -yeah, she had issues. That’s why we were all adopted out. All except the one who died at 10, actually.)

Present day: My baby sister turned 18 in early June and has no idea she’s adopted. I’m her sister and she has 2 other sisters and 2 brothers out here, and we all love her dearly and want to have contact with her. I did find her on Facebook and sent her a message wishing her a happy birthday, but I did not tell her the truth of who I am or how I know her. She hasn’t responded- probably because nobody responds to some stranger telling them happy birthday (especially when the birthday is not public on the profile, and she has never met me before.)

My question: will I be the asshole if I send her a second message saying (basically) “Hey. You are adopted. I am you sister. You have 5 more siblings who want to meet you. Sorry your mom didn’t tell you, but you’re grown up now and we want our sister back.”

???

EDIT: Since every single comment has said to talk to her mother, I need to make clear that this has been an ongoing conversation with her mom for 14+ years. Her mother will never tell her. Also that in an open adoption the adoptive parent has no right to keep that a secret. I absolutely refuse to never meet my own blood in person because some lady illegally decided she’s not allowed to know who she is. Also, in my last conversation with her mother she stated I could tell her whatever I want if ever I see her again, (implying that I won’t) so there is that."
"AITA for not wanting to take my girlfriend to the cinema? | Every week my friend and I go to the cinema to see the latest film, we have done this for years. Recently though whenever there is a big block buster my girlfriend insists on coming along. I've said to her that I am happy to see a film again on the weekend as it gives me a chance to catch some parts I may have missed. She doesn't want to do that though and immediately gets annoyed by me not wanting to take her and thinks I'm embarrassed to introduce them together. They've met multiple times and there is no problem there.

Usually though the cinema is a chance to have a chat with one of my oldest friends about life and problems and it's easier for both of us to do that if she is not there. She doesn't seem to understand that though even after explanation. 

Edit: I forgot to say, the movies is usually preceded or followed by a trip to kfc, that's where we chat. Not during the film. The film is just where it all started so we've just continued seeing films. 

Edit 2: she ended up coming to the film after some extra people were invited at short notice so there was no third wheel. It all went nicely and we had a good time afterwards discussing the film. 
I think what a lot of people were getting confused about here is whether she is ""allowed"" to come along. She has been to a lot films with us before, whenever she does though we make sure there are a couple of extra people prior to the day so no one feels like a third wheel. The problem with tonight though was that she originally was not coming because she had work which very suddenly got cancelled due to random circumstance. there was suddenly a very short time window to hopefully get at least one extra person to come along so no one feels awkward or left out from any chat/conversation. We managed to get one more person so the problem was thankfully avoided. 

I want to thank all the people that gave good advice on how to handle this sort of stuff in the future in case it happens again, you're all great! 

I also want to thank all the people that immediately assumed I was some sort of manipulative, selfish bastard who wanted to have ""man-time"" away from the missus. That was never the problem, the problem was making sure she didn't come along and feel left out or ignored, or having my friend feel like he is encroaching on a sudden date night. "
"AITA for slapping my coworker’s ass while we were both off duty and she expressely asked for it? | Title. We were playing pool at the bar we both work in after we closed, and she was kinda ahead with the drinks. She said “i’m wearing really ugly underwear right now

To which I replied “what do you mean?”

“Well slap my ass to see what I mean”

So I went for it. Twice.

Today she really looks pissed at me. 

How fucked am I if she’s going to tell the boss? I’m 27 she’s 19. Also what should I say if this ever comes up? Pretend it never occurred?

"AITA for hiding weed from my gf? | Me and my gf both smoke a lot of weed. But shes home more hours of the day and I feel like she smokes a lot more than me. But I am the one to pay for the weed everytime, as i make more money.

Normally we get normal marijuana bud from our dealer but sometimes we get a vape cartridge too. Much more powerful and convenient to smoke. So when we get a cart, it usually only lasts a few days. I feel like since I smoke way less, I could make a cart of my own last way way longer.

So what I did was I picked up a quarter ounce of bud and a cartridge. I want to let my gf smoke out of the quarter while I keep the cart hidden for myself. I would not smoke out of the quarter except when we smoke together which isn't that often due to our work schedules.

I feel like an ass for hiding it from her but I'd also feel like an ass telling her that I got the cart for myself and I dont want to share. So what's the less ass thing to do?"
"AITA for giving someone my number and then secretly deleting it off their phone later? | Throwaway.

I met a girl at an event I was helping out with, and we had a pretty good conversation (surprising for me, since I'm normally an awkward gal.) It was all going so well and I thought I'd made a new friend, but then not even an hour into the conversation she asks me if I'd like to join a 'motivational course'. I'm like oh cool, that sounds good and then she tells me it costs about £1,000.

Like, dude. How can you try and sell a £1000 program on someone you've literally just met? I felt like I've been MLM-ed. Not only that, I'm a student, so I don't have that kind of money around. I jokingly say this and she goes 'oh it's cool, you can pay in instalments over a year.' So great, I get to go into debt?

Now, to be fair, she seemed like she was genuinely pushing a motivational course (for those who think it might be some sort of MLM thing) because she could give quite a lot of details on the course (unfortunately I've forgotten the name) and what they have to do on it and how its structured. She also seemed genuinely passionate about it. But it just really soured everything for me- I thought that either there's some kind of benefits for her to recruit others, or else this is some kind of culty thing that they're recruiting for. So later, I deleted my number off her phone when she wasn't looking, because she said she was going to contact me 'so we could go together'. AITA? I feel a bit like one, because it was her phone and I did willingly give the number, and I felt like I should have been a lot more upfront about not wanting to join the program instead of just going 'mm-hmm, interesting.'

Edit: Hi all, I'm sorry I didn't reply to your comments as I was away yesterday. There seems to be quite a strong opinion that I was the asshole for invading her privacy, and I agree- it was definitely my mistake for not even thinking about that. 

Since some people mentioned this, I wanted to add that personally, I wouldn't be offended if someone went through my phone to delete their number off. Maybe I'm a bit weird, but I don't really care and while I'm big on privacy my phone is pretty isolated and has no private info. Furthermore, I would completely sympathise if someone was that anxious to get rid of their number- I have some degree of social anxiety so I know it's not really personal.  So I also think that's why, to me, I completely forgot about her privacy issues, which does make me an asshole. 

Thank you all and I will definitely avoid making this mistake in the future! I definitely need more reflecting on how to react in these situations."
"AITA for expecting to have conversations with my SO regardless of their anxiety? | My bf and I have been dating for a few months and recently the lack of communication has gotten worse for me, this has caused me to talk to friends (who happen to be male) moreso than my SO. It feels like the relationship is constantly hitting a roadblock. I  have an expectation that he should be able to hold a conversation with me. When we talk on the phone most of the conversation is silence and we do not talk OTP often, for maybe 30 minutes daily.

He has a decent amount of anxiety, I get it and have been trying to accommodate him but seeing no improvements it is pissing me off. I have addressed this with him by trying to provoke him, sometimes with anger, to get him to let it out.

Recently I have not been feeling it, I want someone to be able to talk to easily. I am tired of always carrying the conversations, it is just a perpetual cycle of dead ends when it comes to him.  He does not offer up information either, every thing I want to know I have to ask. So, I have been just as short and to the point with the conversation as he has.

AITA?

Update: It is over."
"WIBTA if I don’t agree to pay 50% of my boyfriend’s mortgage when I move in? | Let me preface this with I live in San Francisco. 

My boyfriend owns a 2 bedroom house in a non-gentrified area of the city and it has a studio downstairs that’s turned into an AirBnB. This is relevant as he makes a few hundred dollars off this every month. 

His mortgage is $3800 and in his ideal world I’d pay half. I’m not sure what’s fair. I have offered to pay for utilities and groceries which probably is a max of $500. He said this wasn’t a good idea as he doesn’t think it sets us up for success in terms of me monitoring usage of electricity, lengths of showers, etc. In my ideal world I would pay somewhere under $1000 but no more. I’m currently paying $2000 for a nicer apartment, closer to work & better area apartment (no roommates). 

I’ve asked for advice from friends and the majority have said it’s weird to pay him rent like he’s a landlord and other friends have said why wouldn’t you just like you have been paying rent to your current landlord. 

He can afford to pay the full mortgage just fine and I can afford 50% just fine so this is more a matter of principles. Help?

Adding info based on comments:
- In all previous relationships I have paid 50/50 but this is different as he owns the house. 
- He makes twice as much money as me
- This is a serious relationship, talking engagement next year, kids in 2 years.
- I arrived at $500 - $1000 based on splitting a room which in that neighborhood a room in a house would be about $1200.
- Second room is his office, garage is solely used by him for his two cars. I don’t drive them but benefit from them.
- Not his fault but I’ll be financially responsible for my parents in the next few years, he is only financially responsible for himself.
- He hasn’t proposed splitting Airbnb gains.
- I do all the cooking, I love it, he loves it - we both win. I meal prep for him to have lunch during the week. He pays for dinners when we go out.
- Cleaning will likely be split.
- All home repairs and upgrades have historically been on him. There’s a full kitchen remodel coming up so advice on that would be helpful too."
"AITA for “cock blocking”my friend ? | So I (21M) and my friend (21F) which I have known since middle school and had a crush awhile back but feeling was not mutual so we stayed as friends which is cool .Went to Vegas for the Labor Day weekend. While I’m not a real party person she is but I decided why not it won’t hurt to go to one. So we went and we pregamed in the hotel went to the club.  Keep in mind while we aren’t dating but are friends we always say that we won’t dance with anyone because we don’t want to leave each other alone. 
   We start dancing and she starts getting some attention from guys. I don’t blame them she’s  very attractive and I don’t mind cause we already have this agreement previously mentioned. However, when I go get some drinks at the bar I see her dancing with some guys and I stay alone but she comes back to dance with me. But she continues to leave me and dance with others while I’m dancing by myself. So I start hitting on girls to dance next thing you know I hit it off with a girl called Kendra (btw if you happen to read this hit me up). 
 We go drink and while I am hanging out with this girl I’m worried about my friend who is drunk and dancing with randoms I leave the girl I’m hitting it off with and find my friend grinding on this guy. I don’t mind she’s an adult as long as she is ok with it but the guy starts touching her in places that she wouldn’t agree with if she was not drunk so I step in and ask if she’s good or do I need to talk to the guy. She says it’s cool i say  ok fine . I go back to talk with Kendra but just as I leave my sight of my friend she is not there anymore. I find out the guy takes her to get more alcohol and see them going to the bathroom stalls assuming he’s gonna try to do the deed.   
I run up and say where are y’all going? They go to the bathroom separately and once I see my friend get out I tell her we are leaving . We go back to the hotel and we get into the argument that I was cock blocking her while I saw it as being protective from a guy who wants her drunk and not knowing what his intentions are. We just woke up to start packing but haven’t talked so was I the Asshole ?"
"AITA for not hiring a guy to work at my restaurant because he honked at me? | I am the head chef at a reasonably nice restaurant, and we are in the process of looking for some new people to work in our kitchen. Yesterday, on my day off, I made a brief drive to the restaurant to meet and interview an applicant. On my way to the restaurant, I stopped at a red light. Even though there were no cars in the intersection and I could easily and safely made a right turn, I didn’t because there is a large, “no right turn on red,” sign by the road. There’s a camera on this light, and I’ve seen many people in the Facebook group for my community complaining about getting tickets after they’ve turned right on red at this light, so I followed the order as always.

A car pulled up behind me and honked, which really annoyed me. I turned around and got a look at the driver, but avoided letting any road rage or frustration get the better of me. The light turned green, I drove to my restaurant, and met the guy I had come to interview. And guess who my interviewee was? The guy who had just honked at me.

Very first thing, I questioned him just what he thought he was doing back at the light. His face went pale, and he started apologizing profusely (but insisting there was no traffic and I could have gone), and I responded by pointing out the sign to him, which he claimed not to have noticed. I explain to him how first impressions are everything, and when my first encounter with a prospective employee has them not taking the time to read and follow basic commands and behaving like an angry hothead, it reflects very, very badly upon them. I made it clear how our kitchen has hot and sharp objects and a strict code of conduct to ensure safety and cleanliness and how I just don’t trust someone so temperamental and negligent in such an environment.

The guy begged me for another chance, asked to reconsider, and floated around his other impressive credentials but my answer was a repetitive no. I told him lastly, “I have a piece of advice for you next time you go interview for a job: don’t go blaring your horn at your prospective employer. That’s a real, real bad idea.” I believe I made the right call, but some other people I work with disagree, and have been saying I should have given him another chance. AITA?"
"AITA for requesting unfiltered photos before a first date ? | So quick relevant back story- I've just resumed online dating. I had taken some time off and last time I was actively online dating was about 4 years ago. In that time things seem to have gotten progressively worse ? 

There are a lot of shenanigans on there- such as women requesting money, scams, etc. One thing I see a lot of is really highly filtered photos, and/or photos that are not recent. Sometimes is so bad that they are filtered to the point where they are unrecognizable from the original person. Mostly, it annoys me because I understand the need to put your best self out there- but the amount of filtering is deceptive.

 So what I've started to do is (politely as I possibly can) request a recent unaltered photo of themselves. I'm not asking for anything provacatice; I just want a picture that most accurately represents themselves. 

However a couple women got really offended ? One of them even canceled the date because apparently that's a really rude question to ask. AITA?"
"AITA for being angry at my family for the way they treated me while I was in the hospital and no longer wanting them as my power of attorney/emergency contacts? | Obligatory this is a throwaway, I’m on mobile. 

I’ll get right into it: I was hospitalized in the ICU for 8 days. I spent 3 days intubated, completely unconscious, on a plethora of fentanyl and other drugs. I ultimately removed the tube on my own prematurely, because I was maxed out on what they could give me and just couldn’t keep me under. I had pneumonia, h1n1 flu strain, and a few other things going on with my lungs that were agitated by my use of (nicotine free) e-cigarettes. I had to be intubated urgently because I wasn’t getting enough oxygen, and I shared with the doctor that I used vape products just before she put me under. I was stable for 12 hours prior to intubation and my family and friends had already been by when I was initially admitted. 

After waking up, I came to find that my husband had went through my cell phone to find out that I was vaping and cornered the doctor into sharing this information that I explicitly did not want shared. The information got shared with my husband’s family, and mine, which I expressly did not want. My husband did not know I was using vape products prior to this, no one did. After waking up, my family had confiscated all my belongings, namely my cellphone, and refused to give it back until I promised I would never smoke marijuana again, as if that was the issue. They refused to give me my phone for 3 days and held it hostage from me until I finally promised them what they wanted. I was going completely stir crazy because of this lack of return, and the drugs I was on. I tore out IV’s in my arm and neck, and had to be restrained because I was so irate. From my perspective, by not giving me back my phone, my family literally put me in harms way. 

Because of the way they treated me, I no longer want them as my power of attorney or emergency contacts. I have asked a close friend who is a PA to take over that role for me because I am not happy with how I was treated. I know they were stressed and concerned and that could have impacted [EDIT TO: did impact] their behavior, but nonetheless, I feel how I feel. 

Here’s where I might be an asshole: I am on my parents health insurance plan. I am a 23F in the US with a younger brother, so it does not cost them any additional funds for me to be on their insurance plan at all. I will absolutely pay for all of my medical expenses for this incident, which will total about $6,500.

I am extremely upset with my husband, and would be lying if I said I wasn’t considering divorcing him over this... 

So... would I be the asshole if I removed them as my power of attorney, emergency contacts, and appointed someone else? Am I wrong for feeling how I feel? Am I being unreasonable? 

Also, I obviously won’t be vaping anymore. I’m not even a smoker, I just have an oral fixation and wanted to drop a little weight. 

EDIT: I told them I wouldn’t be vaping anymore. It was not enough to get my phone back. They wanted to hear the words that I would never smoke marijuana again, specifically.

SECOND EDIT: I am not angry my husband went through my phone and found the information. He’s my spouse and I do believe he had a right to know. I am upset that information was pulled out of doctors and then shared with others without my consent.

THIRD EDIT: Some of y’all have pointed out that I seem like I don’t like my husband. I do love him dearly, but at this moment in time I am extremely upset with him and am reconsidering our entire relationship.

FOURTH EDIT: I know I suck for lying to my husband. Wasn’t even up for question!

AN UPDATE: I told my husband how I felt about the way I was treated in the hospital and how I was unhappy with the way it made me feel and I didn’t like being treated like a child. I told him I wanted my friend to be my POA because I couldn’t trust them with this stuff going forward, like what if they tried to have me committed or something against my will? He immediately called my parents to tell them, and now they are upset with me, too. I packed his shit up and he is no longer living in the apartment. EDIT: To be super clear, him sharing this private conversation that occurred between me and him by calling my parents to tell them about it was the last straw. I kicked him out for that reason: another breach of trust in the marriage, not because I’m upset he cares about me. Are we gonna get divorced? Idk. Are we going to continue living together? No, he’s outta here for at least 3 months. I pay the bills around here, not the other way around. Goodbye, at least for a while. I hope this was the tragic ending everyone wanted. I accept my judgement and fully expect to burn in the firey pits of hell after I die.

FIFTH EDIT: I’ve never been diagnosed with a drug problem. I have prescriptions for anxiety and chronic neck pain that I use exactly as prescribed. Other than that, I use marijuana. I do not drink, smoke tobacco/nicotine, or use any other illicit substances. I exercise 5 days a week, eat healthy, and generally speaking take good care of myself. I don’t know how so many of y’all made the leap to me being drug addict. I guess because they couldn’t keep me sedated, the logical conclusion was I’m a heavy opiate user? But the reality is, I have severe anxiety, chronic neck pain, have been getting allergy therapy for the past 6 months which required even more depressants be put in my system, and had to have surgery twice last year that I was prescribed opiates for during my recovery, that I used, exactly as prescribed by my doctor. All of this is managed by the multiple specialist doctors that I see regularly.  Y’all out here acting like I’ve been prostituting for heroin on the corner behind my husbands back for the past year, like damn. Y’all need to chill. I was smoking pot, not crack cocaine. I do not have a drug problem. I haven’t ingested marijuana in 3 weeks now and don’t feel inclined to go out “searching for a score.” I have never abused my prescriptions or taken more than was prescribed by my doctor.

THE FINAL EDIT: Mods messaged me privately and said I can’t edit anymore because I’m “way over character limit,” so no more updates or info for y’all. Sorry! 

I’m not doing a tl;dr"
"AITA Not wanting to date single moms even though I have a child | I have a 3 year old with my ex.

The title pretty much says it all, I don't want to date single moms. My friends said I'm an asshole for that because I have a child, but here's my reasoning:

1) I like the freedom that comes with co parenting. I don't want to balance a second child's schedule and lose out on that freedom.

2) I would like any potential mother figures to prioritize my child and not have to worry about any favoritism (i.e. biological vs step child) or timing conflicts

3) Since mothers usually have more custody time than fathers in my experience, it is a bigger burden for me to take on her kids than for her to take on mine. 

AITA?"
"AITA for accidentally calling my child an 'only child'? | I am my husband's second wife, we married in 2004 after two years of dating. He was married to his first wife from 1990-1996 and had two children, a boy and girl, who were 5 and a half and 8 and a half when we met. From the start I loved those kids, especially his daughter, a talkative little thing with a heck of an imagination and this kind of infectious optimism. Her brother was harder to get to know but he was an almost nine year old boy more interested in skateboarding, videogames, and girls. But I played team sports with my job and we connected over that. Before long we all grew to love each other. 

They lived with their mom full-time about three hours from us but the coparenting situation was really working well. Even when they temporarily moved seven hours away we still saw each other often. Then I had my own son and it felt like the family was complete. The older kids adore their little brother and he's obsessed with them.

My son is 14 now, my step kids are 24 and 27. I'm only 39 (husband is ten years older) and lately I've been craving another child. I didnt get as much time with my stepkids as I wanted and my own son grew up too quickly. I'm still young enough for a new kid and I just took retirement from my job as a police-detective after 18 years on the job, so I have time now. I've had IUDs for several years since my son was born.

Last year my sisters threw me a Mother's Day/Birthday party and my stepdaughter came, gave me a beautiful card and gift, I cried like a baby-back bitch. Halfway through the party I noticed she suddenly stopped involving herself, started treating me coldly, and left early, despite saying she would stay the night with us. I was very sad. But then she stopped talking us. It took five months for my husband to get her to tell him what was wrong.

During the party I was talking to some of my friends and i mentioned wanting another child because i had six siblings and i didnt want my son to grow up feeling like an only child. Apparently she heard me say that and thought I was saying my son is an only sibling. She still wont speak to me but at least she isnt ignoring her father and brother anymore.

Was I an asshole for saying what I did?"
"AITA for buying myself wine when my fiancee can't have any? | So importantly my fiance is deathly allergic to alcohol as such she can never try it.

I do not share her allergy I have had alcohol before. But this happened yesterday.

we were at the store and I've been really wanting alcohol because I do enjoy it very much I'm way past the wine section and I got myself this dark chocolate wine with my own money she and I both of Love dark chocolate and she was upset because she can't have any we got her some dark chocolate hazelnut chocolate because I agree it would be completely unfair if I had a ""treat"" and she didn't. She still says it's not fair and joked about specifically eating in front of me while I drove 2 taught me.

I do try to avoid alcohol since I'm with her since giving together with her over 2 years ago I have drank alcohol on three occasions. 

Am I the Asshole? Should I just give it up entirely?

Edit so people will stop misgendering: I am female hence the name ""Lexi""

Edit 2: I'm no longer allowed to reply to you all but I'm not ignoring you, the mods and I just disagree on the difference between arguing and discussing/correcting (although I'll admit to getting irritated at people clearly not reading)"
"AITA for accepting a drink from a single woman, and not outright declaring that I was married, despite clearly wearing my wedding ring? | The other night I was out with a few of my buddies at a karaoke bar.  All but one of us are married, but we like to get together once a month or so to have some beers and laugh at how poorly we all sing.  We generally keep to ourselves, and none of us are there to try and pick up women.

Despite this, the other night a young woman approached our table and told me her friend had spotted me across the bar and thought I looked familiar.  She asked if I would go over to her table and speak with her (admittedly attractive) friend, so I did.  It turns out that we did not in fact know each other, and she apologized for making me come over and offered to buy me a drink.  Since I'm a big fan of free alcohol, I agreed.  We went to the bar, she bought us a round of shots, and we conversed for maybe 5-10 minutes.  At this point I could tell she was into me and was starting to act more flirtatious/ lightly touch my arm, etc.

Since I'm married, I didn't think it was appropriate to engage with this girl any further, so I thanked her for the drink, and excused myself to the bathroom.  Once out of the bathroom, I went back to my table and rejoined my friends (who all proceeded to give me shit about girls trying to pick me up at a bar).

About five minutes later, the girl who bought me the drink comes up to my table and asks why I didn't go sit with her.  I politely explained that I was married and I didn't think it would be appropriate.  At this point she became visibly upset and basically chewed me out saying I was a prick for accepting the free drink and leading her on.  She then stormed off.  **Bear in mind that I have been wearing my wedding ring this entire time.  It is very hard to miss (large/silver/shiny), and I've made no attempt to hide it at all.**

Fast forward to the next day when I am recounting this story to my wife.  She also gets mad at me and tells me that most guys don't go to bars ""just to have fun"" and that I shouldn't even be accepting drinks from single girls in the first place.  She thinks that I should have declared that I was married before I even spoke to the girl.

Meanwhile I'm over here like wtf did I even do?  I feel like I handled the situation appropriately, and yet somehow I've managed to piss off two women in the process."
"AITA for not going to my girlfriend's place because of her dog? | I've been with Sarah for three months. She is lovely and I'm enjoying it. I'm 35 and she's 33. 

Sarah has an elderly female English Mastiff dog called Jess. She's had the dog since it was a puppy and has always lived alone with her. Due to this the dog is very spoiled and always wants to cuddle. 

More than once I've snuggled with Sarah on the sofa and Jess has tried to come in and cuddle with her. English Mastiff dogs are huge and having an enormous dog trying to force her way in between us is very frustrating. 

Due to this, I've said I'm happy to spend time with her at my place or outside on dates but I won't go to her place because the dog makes it difficult. 

Sarah wasn't happy and accused me of being jealous of the dog which isn't fair. I just don't want to have our time together constantly interrupted."
"AITA for bringing food from a different restaurant into another restaurant? | Hey team,

Last night, I went to a concert with my girlfriend and her parents. After finding parking, my girlfriend and her mother went into a Panera Bread to get a meal before the show started. I ran to a gyro place next door to grab a bite to-go. 

I get my food and go back to the Panera to eat with the fam. As I begin to nom, I notice my girlfriend and her mother staring aghast at me. They also keep staring at the guy wiping down tables behind me and then staring at one another. 

Finally the guy goes away and I ask them again. This time they tell me that they're horrified that I'd bring food from another place in and the man behind me was the restaurant manager. 

I laugh it off and say that a big city Panera Bread has more to worry about than a rogue gyro man. My girlfriend later brings up that I shouldn't have brushed off her feelings like that. 

My girlfriend's dad then come in and agrees with his wife and daughter. So. AITA? 

Note: I'm American and my girlfriend and her family are British. Perhaps there are some cultural differences I'm unaware of? This happened in America.  "
"AITA For constantly telling my fiance to get a vasectomy? | Throwaway because he knows my account.

Me [F 27] and my fiance [M 28] have been together a little over two years. In the time I've know him he would always share his dislike for children. He can't stand being stuck in the same room as them and anytime someone asks his opinion of having his own he always says he never wants any as it would ruin his life. I've never had a strong opinion one way or the other. I'd prefer to never have kids as well but if it happened I could make it work. Because I love him and want to be with him I accept the fact I'll never have any, and that's fine.

The problem is our only form of prevention is birth control pills, we rarely use condoms (sometimes I just like being a twinkie instead of a toaster strudel) I've been on the pill for 10 years with no problems as I'm very diligent with taking them. I have a timer on my phone and have never missed a pill that I can remember. But I know shit happens and it's not 100% effective. This is why I brought up to my fiance he should get a vasectomy if he truly never wants children. The first time he just kind of laughed and said that was a bit extreme. I told him if I ever did get pregnant I'd most likely want an abortion but I don't know how I'd feel unless it happened.

Throughout the last year everytime he brings up his hate for babies I bring up him getting a vasectomy. He's starting to get annoyed with me but I hate that all the  responsibility is on me to prevent an accident. I know it's his body and his choice but if it's something he thinks will ruin his life I want to protect him from that.

AITA for bringing this up so frequently?"
"AITA for thinking my fiance isn't entitled to any of my tax return? | My fiance and I live together with her two children from a previous marriage. I bought a house for us to live in. I get an extra bit of tax return because I get to claim the interest on the house. She pays roughly 70 percent of what I pay towards the mortgage meaning she pays less than I do. I calculated this based off our incomes. I bought this house. I paid the down payment. I paid for all the inspection costs, tests, etc when I bought the house. The house is in my name. I am taking all the financial risks. When something breaks, I fix it and I pay for it. I pay for over half the bills and I pay half for groceries. Keep in mind that I am one of four people living in this house. I don't mind the arrangement, but when it comes to tax time she seems to think that it's unfair that I get to claim the interest on the house on my taxes and get a little extra in my refund. My perspective is that I took the financial risk. She is paying 900 a month for 3 bedrooms in a 3000 squarefoot house that is only 10 years old. An apartment would cost her at least 1500 and it would probably be shitty. When we rented together I didn't ask for some of her tax refund because she gets to claim two children as dependents. Because I don't think I'm entitled to it even though I'm really paying half of what she pays to have them. Half the bills, half the groceries, I pick up the check all the time when we go out. Now you might be thinking what about clothing for the kids? Health insurance? all that! Well her ex pays for all of that. My perspective is that I have been paying 25 percent in taxes for years because I don't have kids and I didn't get married. Now I'm getting a little more back and I'm the one taking all the risk and she isn't entitled to it. She isn't the home owner. She can walk away anytime and leave me with the mortgage. I have also told her that in the event things don't work out between us I will sell the house after we both locate new places and that I would be willing to split any profits with her after I get my down payment back and all the money I spent on materials building the deck and fixing random stuff. I also explained that there wont be profits after realtor fees, closing costs, etc. So am I the asshole for thinking she isn't entitled to any of my tax refund? I pay for half her kids shit and the kids are only at her exes every other weekend and I'm not getting to claim any dependents and I don't think I should get to. It just seems like a logical argument to me. If you get half of my deposit because of X do I get half of yours then because of Y?"
"AITA for refusing to meet family who I wasn't allowed to meet as a child? | For background, I grew up in a cult that practiced excommunication. I lost two brothers and a sister as a child, never met many of my cousins (their parents had been marked by the church), and I only had one grandparent growing up. I have a younger sister who avoided baptism, so she is a part of my life. This  resulted in me seeking ""family"" through close friends I know I can count on, and blood relation means almost nothing to me. 

Now for my current situation...

My sister recently came into contact with a cousin who's father is my uncle. She wanted to meet my family, and my mother assumed I'd be happy to meet her as well. In reality, I have no wish to reconnect with family, for fear of reopening wounds I had closed as a child. When my mother asked if I'd be around that day, I said, ""I don't have any interest in meeting family now. I don't know them, and I'm doing fine without them.""

My parents and sister both think ITA, but I feel justified in my decision. 
AITA?

Edit: For clarification, my cousin's father was excommunicated, but his children were not. I do not completely trust my parent's motivations, as they are always looking to recruit for their church."
"AITA for telling my brother to keep his opinion to himself? | So I went to see Captain Marvel on Friday with a friend of mine and my brother texted me after the movie was done to ask where I was. 

I replied ""I just finished seeing Captain Marvel with my friend. It was awesome!"" he replies ""I'd like it if Brie Larson wasn't in it"". 

So I gathered myself a bit and replied ""I think this is something you should probably keep your opinion to yourself about for the time being seeing as i'm happy for having seen it and all"" and I get ""Ok"" back from him. 

That night when I get home he's sullen and slamming doors, I ask my parents if he's okay, did something happen, and no one can figure out what's wrong so finally I ask him if he's okay and he tells me ""I'm just keeping my opinion to myself! If anyone wants to ask me anything, if anyone cares about MY opinion, they can ask from now on! I'm not gonna say nothing!"". 

And things further blew up after I told my Dad how the events unfolded and even showed him the texts and getting him involved made things worse because now my brother felt ganged up on. 

The whole thing blew over but i'm left questioning my choices here because I really don't think what I said was that bad considering. I just didn't want my happiness after the movie to be dampened by a negative unprompted opinion on something I enjoyed. 

AITA here?"
"WIBTA if I made a registry for my wedding reception even if 95% of the people there are not invited to the wedding? | Backstory:

Getting married on a Thursday, rehearsal is in a different state (my home state) on a Saturday.

The reason for this is that I’ve always wanted a small wedding. I believe it should be about me and my husband and something that makes us happy and we are NOT big part people. We don’t like crowds and I believe large wedding would make it very stressful and that’s not what we want. 

The wedding would be literally just us, his mom, my parents and my 4 brothers and my sister in law. 

The main reason for this is because I have a MASSIVE family. Both of my parents have 8 siblings and they each have an average of 5 kids. Some grown with children (I legitimately have 75 cousins) I see them all at least once a year (two families I see only once every 5 years of so because of distance), but since if I invite the aunts/cousins that I’m close to, id have to invite them all in order to keep peace in the family.

so I decided to do a large reception where everyone is invited to celebrate our marriage but a small ceremony where his mom can come (she is sick and cannot travel so we are getting married close to her home) and both of us are comfortable enough to have fun and actually enjoy our wedding.

However, I was wondering if it would be rude to make a registry even though none of the people at the reception are invited to the wedding? 

Like we really don’t need the things but don’t want people to be flying blind and receive 4 blenders. 

So WIBTA to not invite people to the wedding but invite them to a Facebook group about the reception and the registry??"
"AITA For losing interest in a Tinder match after she started calling me ""love"" after 15 or so messages? | Okay, so the title is pretty self-explanatory. I matched with a girl on Tinder and messaged her, because I'm bored and I'm moving around a lot between now and next year. We talk a little bit and this girl seems maybe a bit too eager to agree with me, and seemed less enthusiastic about the very things she said were the things she loved most after I mentioned being lukewarm on one or two of them. I didn't think too much about it, because I figured that's the kind of game you play at this stage. The match happened kind of late, and so I end up getting tired as fuck and offering to pick things up the next day. I would have gone and messaged again the next day, but then she signed off by referring to me as ""love."" This made me extremely uncomfortable and made me think that she was going to be somewhere between uncomfortably clingy and a full on stalker. I didn't message the next day but didn't bother unmatching, because she ended up being buried under a new set of matches and I figured the same would happen to me on her end. Anyway, today I changed a small part of my bio on tinder and apparently she saw it on her feed and messaged again. I'm a little scared.

&#x200B;

Finally, I am an American and live in America, no one in my area would use the word ""love"" as a casual greeting as one would in the UK. It would only be something that you called someone with whom you were involved. There may be a small chance that she is a British expat, based on the fact that her name is more common in the UK than the US, but based on what is mentioned in her bio, I highly doubt it. 

&#x200B;

So yeah, AITA? Am I overreacting, or am I rightfully concerned about a huge red flag?"
"AITA for snitching on my friend who broke my phone | So I put this story on r/maliciouscompliance, and had a lot of people saying I did the right thing, and people calling me a bully. I’m in 10th grade and the first part of this story is in March of this year. So me and a group of my friends were at our schools  youth group (I’m catholic) and I was trying to show one of my friends a picture on my phone. While I was scrolling to it,  I scrolled past a very unflattering picture of David, and my friend started laughing. A few other people came over and saw it, and they were all laughing. Then David came back, saw it, and ripped my phone out of my hands, and slammed it on the ground, completely destroying it. He wouldn’t pay for it, so I eventually just bought a new phone. 

Later in the year, were at a party, and I had my laptop. I don’t remember this very well, but at one point he was holding it and accidentally smashed it against the wall, and broke the hard drive. He wouldn’t pay for that either, and my dad bought me a new one. 

Now fast forward a few months to last week. We’re in math class, taking a test. The teacher steps out of the classroom for about 25 seconds and David asks me for my answers. I’m still mad at him for the past events, so here’s where the malicious compliance happens. I notice he has one answer filled in the wrong spot, so I told him he could, and after he got about 15 filled in, he realized he had them all in the wrong spot, and erased all of them. right as he did that, I turned mine in. The teacher gets back just as I’m sitting back down, and David’s pleading with me for the answers. The teacher asks what’s going on, and I told him that David was trying to copy my answers. He got a 0. Does that make me a bad person?"
"AITA for telling my mom it's unhealthy to eat strawberries and whip cream for sometimes 2 meals a day? | Alt account just in case

&#x200B;

TL;DR My moms family has addictive tendencies. my mom in the past was addicted to coca cola and stopped 3 years ago. is in much better shape now. during her divorce recently she started finishing off family sized deserts every 2 or 3 days. that stopped after the divorce. things were good. Now she's eating strawberries and whip cream for sometimes 2 meals a day, and i told her that it was unhealthy and that I care about her health and she got pretty annoyed and brushed me off when i tried to hug her saying ""why do you want to love me now after coming in here and telling me how disgusting I am?"" Should i not have called her out on it? Read last paragraph for more things during when i talked to her.

&#x200B;

My moms family has always had addictive tendencies (grandpa used to be an alcoholic) and a few other instances that are kinda out of the way. My mom has some of those tendencies too. She has never drunk, done drugs, or even had coffee because she knows she could get addicted to them. My mom used to be a bit overweight and used to drink basically a full bottle of Coca Cola, or like a McDonalds large every day and was addicted to it. she finally saw how bad it was and quit. she has been off of it for 3 years now. And I'm super proud of her. shes lost over 80 pounds, exercises 4 days a week and is really getting slimmer.

&#x200B;

 I went into her room and said goodnight and asked if she'd eaten dinner, and she said, ""this is"". I said that's not good laughingly and she laughed too, and I asked how many cans she goes through a week, and she said it takes her 2 days or so about to go through a can. so I start saying how much sugar etc is in it and do quick math in my head saying how much cholesterol and etc there is in it and she starts getting kinda defensive and saying ""well the strawberries are healthy"" and I try to say well that's the only thing in it other than whip cream. I try to sit down and give her a hug but at this point shes just brushing me off and saying ""why do you want to love me now after coming in here and telling me how disgusting I am?"" and I said I'm only saying this because I care about your health, and then she says ""no its because you're getting something out of it"". I ask what I would get out of it and she says something along the lines of making me feel good about myself. at this point, shes full on annoyed with me and I'm just trying to take care of her.

So am I the asshole for confronting her about it? should I just stay out of her business?"
"AITA for not wanting to pay for a diamond ring? | So my girlfriend and I recently got engaged, and I figured it would be nicer to have her pick out her own ring rather then me guessing what she likes. 
Now I already know my girlfriend loves shiny things, but now she is absolutely adamant that she wants a real diamond ring. Personally I don't like the idea of shelling out so much money for a piece of jewelry with an artificial high price. So instead I offered to buy her one that was lab-grown, as it's way cheaper but also doesn't involve shady business practices and labor. 

Money isn't an issue, it's really about the ethics for me. I do not like the idea of buying her something that potentially harmed someone in the making of it for our wedding. But she thinks I'm being stingy for not buying her a ""real"" diamond. We've already gotten in a few arguments over this so now I wanted to ask you guys if I should just suck it up or not."
"AITA for being petty about paying for coworkers meal | Edit to accept Judgement

The people of reddit have spoken.  IATA

Thanks for weighing in everyone.  After sleeping on it and listening to some of your input I agree the comment should have been left out. 

Thanks! 





I work in a specialized department at my company with a slightly small group of people.  

Usually some of us grab coffee together in the mornings.  Now we are all paid very well to begin with, but under certain circumstances, some of us are given a bonus (20%) for a day or multiple days at a time.  

Generally, the guys getting the bonus will pay for the other guys breakfast (5-7 dollars).  I've paid for breakfast multiple times for one person, we'll call him Phil, wether I'm getting the daily bonus or not as sometimes it's easier.  Say the waitress forgets to split the check, I'll just take it and pay for Phil instead of asking her to redo it. Phil does not do this.  He will make the waitress redo the check. 

Phil, although he regularly gets the bonus, has never offered to pay.  I'm found out from other people in the department, that Phil is known for always accepting the free breakfast, but never reciprocating.  One time I paid on my way out, and he didn't even feel inclined to leave a tip.  Luckily the other person I paid for, took care of it.   

Personally, I don't care.  I buy for someone to be nice, and usually decline if people try to purchase for me, but he's never even thanked me for buying. 

Recently we were out, and all the guys getting the daily bonus asked for combined checks.  Then it got to us, and Phil asked for individual checks.   I interrupted and said ""No, one check is fine, I don't want him to struggle paying the mortgage this month.""

Now, most people in the department loved my response, but I'm hearing a few guys think it was rude.  I think it was perfectly acceptable. So what say you reddit, AITA?



Edited for Info

1. It is absolutely not a money issue.  

2. He's done this his entire career. 

3. You don't understand the context of it, but people who received the bonus, usually pay for the other guy for a reason.  They are not required to, but it's considered polite to do so.

4. My bigger issue is the Never saying thank you, and going out of his way to split the check when it's possible he'll have to pay. 

5. I did stop buying for him, but this particular situation made me want to, just out of spite."
"AITA for using HR as a bludgeon? | This just happened. I was walking up company stairs and this clique was walking down, obstructing the entirety of the stairway (it’s wide enough for 4 or 5 people). i was walking up the far right side and i didnt feel like i needed to move so i turned my head somewhat to the right and decided if they didnt want to bump into me they would need to move, wasnt gonna just wait.

so i collide shoulders with the lady walking on the side on their left, and she turns around and asks me if i’m blind and demanded am apology.

so i turn around and say that i am actually blind in my left eye (which is true, retinal detachment left my left eye blind, which concidentally is the side she hit me from), and then say something to the effect of how interesting hr would find it to hear that she was belittling me about it. i read out the name on her name tag while i was at it. her clique walked away in the middle of the conversation too, but there were plenty of other witnesses as everyone was heading to and from lunch.

added bonus, i’m also asian (thin eyes thing) so she started apologizing, and i just walked away and she followed me for a bit but i ignored her and put on headphones.

i actually have no intention of going to hr, i just wanted her to eat her words really. so aita? i’m expecting esh."
"AITA because I stopped to get breakfast when my pregnant wife couldn't eat. | My wife was pregnant, we were going to a scan, or something, which meant she wasn't allowed to eat for a prolonged period of time before, few hours, but because the scan was first thing (09:00) in the morning she hadn't eaten since since about 19:00 the previous day.

The plan was that I would go to the scan with her, then take her home and then go straight to work. I didn't have any annual leave left to take so my boss told me I could go but I'd have to work though lunch to work it back and stay late to make up if it took longer than an hour. So I knew I potentially wouldn't have time to pick up anything to eat until  18:30 - 19:00.

So on the way to the scan I called into McDonald's drive thru to get breakfast because there was nothing in the house. My wife flipped out, calling me selfish and inconsiderate and cried a lot.

I explained to her why but she didn't care, she said I was being unsupportive and selfish. I don't think I was wrong, if the roles were reversed i would positively insist that someone I care about get breakfast.

Was I being an asshole ?

**Quick update**

There was no possibility of me going after, I had to go right to work, only had a bit of time before because we left 10 minutes early."
"AITA for hanging reminder signs to my wife around the house? | We bought our first home together in May after years of renting and I want to take care of our investment. She's a bit of a slob, though. After talking to her twice about something, and her failing to stop the behavior, I hang up a small sign, typically a Post-It with tape:

* Next to the toilet: Flush me when done or my bowl will stain
* Next to the blender: Keep me upright or my bearings may seize
* On the trashcan: Close my lid or I attract flies
* On the kitchen sink: Run my disposal when discarding food or I clog
* Next to cleaning supplies: Close us when done or we dry out

I do feel like a bit of a pedant when hanging these signs, as if I'm educating a child on how to take care of things. But if she needs these reminders, that's fine by me, they don't bother me, and I'm not being judgemental about *her.* Edit: clarity: I'm insulting myself here, not her.



She however has told me I'm being passive aggressive. To me there's nothing passive about it: in every case I had alread talked to her twice about the problem. Likewise there's nothing aggressive about it: I'm not angry and I don't think less of her, I simply want to solve a problem.

So which of us is the asshole?

Edit: thanks for the responses, all."
"AITA because I ""forced"" my kids to watch the full house episode. | the episode is Silence is not golden. 

my kids are 7,10 and 14. 

so I felt that my kids where ready to learn about abuse, so I showed them the full house episode to explain it. it helped them understand it and I told them that if they noticed anything that they could come to me.
its an episode about an abused kid. 

here is why I feel like a asshole. 

my wife told me not to do it as she did not want to explain it to the kids yet, when I asked her when she wanted to explain it to the kids she walked away. I never got an answer. 
I told her how beneficial it will be and she got mad and told me that it's scary for kids (that's the point) 

I got annoyed and just did it anyway. 

I now have a very mad wife 

AITA?"
"AITA for not cooking my husband dinner? | My husband works incredibly hard, long, crazy hours.  I also work, have a volunteer job that takes up quite a few hours a week, and am 100% responsive for all things kids during the week. Life is hectic and cooking is usually on the bottom of my list of things to do.  I also hate cooking.  The children are fed but not with gourmet meals.  It usually just stuff I’ve tossed together or kid friendly food like chicken nuggets.  On the rare occasion I actually make a presentable meal, I will make enough for him too but that happens maybe once a month. He recently expressed it upsets him when he gets home at 8 or 9pm then has to make himself dinner.  We’ve tried those meal delivery service meals and pre-prepared meals from local deli but he says those are all too expensive (which really means he doesn’t want to spend money on them not that we can’t afford them). I suggested he meal prep on sundays for the week and he said we don’t have time for hours of meal prep (he’s right - kids have 3 different sports on Sundays in 3 different places all day long).  He thinks I am being unreasonable and should just start making nice meals daily.  My day goes from 7am until 9pm. The last thing I want to include is cooking a “real meal.”  AITA?

Edit 2: thanks peeps. I am going to have a convo with my husband to figure out how to work this out so we share dinner responsibilities and up my veggie game so my kids don’t get rickets and die of scurvy. I appreciate your opinions and dose of reality!

Edit 1 for clarification: I have a paid job that brings in 50% of my families income, i run my kid’s school’s pta, haul the kids to all their weekly stuff, and do all the household work.  We have two kids (but between them they do 3 sports one is in elementary school the other in daycare- not 3 kids):

I’ve been asked multiple times for daily schedule so here’s a typical weekday:

5am get up and exercise / get dressed / make breakfast / pack school lunch

6:30am get kid 1 up, dressed, fed, and work on school stuff (he struggles academically so we do mini tutoring sessions in mornings to help him)

7:15am put him on the bus

7:20am wake up kid 2, get her dressed and fed, take her to daycare

8am-4pm work my job where I bring in 50% of the household income plus healthcare

4pm pick up kid 1 from aftercare and kid 2 from daycare

5pm-7pm sports, kid therapy, kid tutoring, kid shit, play with kids just depends on the day, try to shove food in their faces

7pm put kid 2 to bed

7:30pm kid 1 homework and play

8pm put kid 1 to bed

In there sprinkle the volunteer work which is running kid 1’s school’s pta and things like cleaning house / laundry / walking dogs / etc.

10pm go to bed after handling stuff


Husbands typical day:

7am wake up, get dressed

8am leave for work

7pm-8pm come home and complain about work. (Edit the complain part was supposed to be funny but obviously came across as bitter instead.  I will work on that too and appreciate him more for how hard he works.)


Weekends are different.  Weekends are usually me doing pta stuff, kids’ sports, shopping, paying bills, etc.  husband will do kids’ sports shit and qt with them but usually doesn’t see them during the week.

What do I eat?  I have a gluten sensitivity, acid reflux, and an auto immune disorder so mostly eat super bland stuff."
"AITA for not letting two old men sit with me at Starbucks? |      I (21F) was studying at the Starbucks (every college girls natural habitat) on my campus. It was fairly busy, but nothing unlike how busy it is everyday. I sat at a circular table that had 4 chairs, but this was the only table available and I had a midterm in an hour so I need to get studying. The table also was not big at all, my laptop and notebook took up the whole thing. 

     Suddenly, two older men put their belongs on the empty chairs and went to go order their drinks. I look up and take out my headphones, hella confused. Neither one of them said anything to me before going to get their drinks. Now, being a 21 y/o girl, all strange older men appear as a threat to me for a number of obvious reasons i don’t think i need to elaborate on. The girl sitting next to me could tell I was concerned and told me to just tell the men I had friends coming to sit with me so they would leave. So I did when they came back, and they argue with me that I need to let them sit with me until my friends come because it was busy and there was no where else to sit. Mind you, I was extremely stressed about my midterm and didn’t need two older men distracting me while I was studying, and they didn’t ask if they could sit with me. I had also told my roommates about the situation at this point and one of them was actually on their way to meet me at Starbucks.

       Then a Starbucks employee (~25M) comes over and tells me that I have to let the two men sit with me because it was busy. I was furious at this point. I told the employee that he shouldn’t force me to sit with strangers and I needed to study. He said “well they are nice people and are regulars here” and I responded with “I don’t care if they are regulars. I am uncomfortable in this situation. I am a young adult female, I don’t know these men, and I don’t know what their intentions are” at this point I stormed out because I was so upset. AITA for not letting the men sit with me and getting upset at the starbucks employee? I can’t help but leave the situation so confused on why so many people thought it was normal to sit at a table with a complete stranger. I understand it was busy, but I asked them not to sit with me, couldn’t they have just waited for a table to clear?



A little background on me: I am a manager of a cafe on campus and have been in the food industry since I was 16. I am usually very understanding of food service employees, but I felt like this employee stepped out of line.


EDIT: There were more empty seats available, not empty tables. Every single four person table in Starbucks was occupied by one person. These men had many other options to SIT at, but not a whole table to themselves, I should have said that.

EDIT EDIT: sorry should have said that when the men came back they also had put their stuff on the table (their newspaper, other papers, and a few drinks). This is when I said something because like i said, small table.

More: people keep telling me to go to the library. On my campus, Starbucks was the closest thing I had to study at in terms of where my test was at and the library was a 20 min walk. There weren’t many options for me to go to.

OKAY MORE EDITS because I’ve seen people saying I wasn’t a paying customer and I don’t understand where they got that information. If you must know I got a tomato mozz sandwich and a cold brew!"
"AITA for working on the night of my daughter's birthday? | My daughter is not a kid anymore. She is turning 21 but still lives with me at home. This is fine because she attends the local university. This week is her birthday. I work a job with long, stressful hours and currently, we are ""in season"" which means that my job is a lot busier than usual. Normally, the day of the week my daughter's birthday falls on I have off, but this is one of the few exceptions and was not something I had been able to foresee and ask time off for. 

My own mom recently became very sick and right now there isn't a lot of money to go around. I am trying to make sure I have a good amount saved up so I can take a trip to go see and take care of her for a little while. This also means I cannot take the night off on my daughter's birthday to celebrate with her. This will also be her first birthday without her dad, who passed 10 months ago and whom she was very close to. There are no siblings and we have don't have relatives that live nearby. She also went through a difficult break up with her boyfriend somewhat recently so there is no one romantic in the picture.

When I told her the situation as sympathetically as possible, she got very upset with me and accused me of putting my work first. I didn't feel as though this was fair because I have a lot on my plate as well. I asked why she didn't celebrate with friends, and she told me her best friend's grandma was having major surgery this week and so she wouldn't be available and that the rest of her friends probably wouldn't do anything with her because it falls on a weekday and they are all busy. 

So I conceded a bit and told her we could celebrate in two weeks when I finally have time off. This upset her more and she responded with ""my birthday isn't in two weeks"" then said I wouldn't care or would forget by then anyways. Since then we haven't spoken much. I really think I am not wrong here due to circumstances. I would love to celebrate with her, but right now it's just not feasible and I need the money. However, she really did make me feel like the guilty party here."
"WIBTA if I call my coworker out on passing off Reddit jokes as his own? | Allright, so I have this coworker that I have now caught 3 times passing off Reddit jokes as his own.

The first time was about how he was eating at Burger King and the gay cashier told a customer not to be rude because he was gay and the customer told him wrong, that he likes dick too. I laughed, and then a couple hours later, saw the meme on here and just shook my head.

The second time, he related a story that someone asked when you knew your kid was really dumb and how some kid threw their shoe out the window and didn't want her dad to be mad. He said his little daughter did that. Again, I just shook my head and went about my business, as this time, I had literally just seen that post and actually read quite a few of the stories.

Then, just this morning, he really tried to say that he got a haircut to look like his friend when he was a little kid so their teacher couldn't tell them apart, but that his friend was black. This time,  another one of my coworkers looked at me wide eyed and I told her that was the 3rd time I've caught him stealing internet jokes and passing them off as my own. She said, oh yeah, thats a Reddit joke. 

So, would I be the asshole if I call this guy out for being so unoriginal?

EDIT: I have thoroughly enjoyed all your responses. I wasn't expecting such strong emotions. I can't reply to each comment, but this was really a hypothetical AITA. My other coworker and I were laughing so hard about making a post on this sub. Anyways, I don't know how you guys got that I was upset or angry or bothered by this, the only type of way I feel about it is just it is what it is. I just quietly chuckle to myself, today my other coworker just happened to be there and catch it so we were chuckling together."
"AITA if I told my gay friend he’s gotten “gayer” | I know this is kind of a sensitive topic. But hear me out on this one. 

Me and this guy, let’s call him Rick,(again he’s part of the LGBTQ+ community) had been friends since college. So we’ve known each other for about 8 years. Don’t get me wrong, right now he’s one of my best friends. 

In college, Rick often called me names and made fun of my weight (I’m chunky, so you know what I mean), etc. Not once did I ever fight back. I just cried because I’m the kind of person who does not want to cause a scene or stuff like that and I hated confrontations. My life was kind of hell when I was in college and I think that was one of the factors why I developed depression. I can tell that I wasn’t the jolly, always-smiling girl that I was before. But I kept being friends with him and at the end of our college days we had gotten pretty close and he’s been my best friend since. 

Fast forward 2017, we had already then graduated from college for about 2 years. We were at a friend’s house for her birthday. There were about 8 of us. We were just talking, everything was just cool and all that. Then the little brother of our friend (the birthday girl)  walked in. I haven’t seen him for a long time. I noticed he had gotten taller so I said out loud, “Wow! ——- got taller!” Then out of nowhere, Rick chimed in and said to me, “Well, you got fatter!”. I got so angry that I told him, “Well, you got gayer!”.  My friends were like “Ohhhhhh! 👀” He got pissed at me and never talked to me for the rest of the day. I asked my friends, some of them said he got what he deserved and some said it was below the belt.

We’re ok now but idk, it’s still  just bothering me from time to time. 

Was I the asshole?"
"AITA for being offended by my girlfriends opinion of a car? | Let me start by saying that I don't have the thickest skin, especially when it comes to people that I am close with.

My girlfriend and I were leaving a parking lot when I mentioned that I would drive a Volkswagen beetle if it was like the one that I was pointing to, and that I like the car. She plainly said that she thought the car was girly. I told her that I didn't think it was necessarily girly and that I liked it. This started an argument between us and she said that anyone would think the car was girly. I was basically saying that I didn't like that her first statement to me saying that I liked the car was that it was girly. After about 30 seconds to a minute of arguing she said the ""I shouldn't be taking this up the butt."" I started to be quiet and just kinda lean towards door of the car and turn my head away. She continued to talk about how I always get hurt by things that I have no right to get hurt by and that she isn't gonna apologize for something she didn't do wrong (I never asked her too, I only asked her to be more sensitive sometimes). She continually got more mad at me for saying that I caused the argument and telling me that I always do this. When we got back to her place I eventually left because I didn't want to argue all night long and I could tell it wasn't gonna stop until I told her that I understand all of what she is saying and that she is right. I haven't apologized but she said I had ""the power to fix this but I'm choosing not to.""

&#x200B;

I know that I sometimes get offended easily, but AITA?"
"AITA for sharing a photo of my husband and son to my family group chat after my sister told us she’s infertile | So about a month ago my sister told us she’s infertile. It’s a shame and I feel bad for her but life goes on. I’m the of my generation to have kids in my family, so my parents have been badgering me to send them pictures and videos because they can’t visit.

Yesterday my husband was asleep on the sofa with my son in his arms and the cat sleeping next to him and I thought it was really cute so I took a picture and sent it to the family group chat(my parents, grandma, two brothers and sister). My mom sent a bunch of hearts and my brothers sent one word answers like “cute” and “nice”. My sister didn’t respond and I honestly wasn’t even thinking about her being infertile when I sent it, I mean it’s been a month.

My sister then left a voicemail that was a long rant saying how it was insensitive and rude and I should have thought about what I was sending. 

I don’t think I did anything wrong, it’s been a month and the world doesn’t revolve around her, I’m not going to be thinking about her problems all the time. She must see babies all the time on social media.

AItA?"
"AITA for telling my uber driver to leave me alone? | I (25F) took an uber hime from dinner tonight. When I got out at my apartment I thanked my uber driver and walked to my door. When I got to my door I was looking for my keys and noticed the car wasn’t moving- so I waited. I stood there for a minute or so and my uber driver rolled the window down. 

I looked over and he said he was waiting for me. I asked him to go and he said he “wanted to make sure I got in safely”. I told him to go but he continued to wait. 

Finally I said “please stop being a creep and leave me alone” and he told me he was being a gentleman but I said to leave me alone and he aggressively honked and drove away.  I gave him a 3 star review. 

I know a 3 star review could put him in danger of losing his job and in his head he was “being a gentleman” but from my perspective he’s a strange man I don’t know waiting for me to enter my building. I don’t want him to see which apartment I go to and I don’t feel safer having a stranger wait for me. 

AITA for telling him to leave me alone and giving him a 3 star review?"
"AITA for pointing out its unfair for my grandma to give my biological kids money but not my step kids? | I’m 31, I live in pretty much your standard podunk town. I have two bio kids, 12 and 13, and 2 step kids, 11 and 9.  

My grandma likes to give my bio kids money, but she will hardly ever give my step kids money. She has on the odd occasion slipped them $10 here or there but she will ALLWAAYYSSS give my biokids more stuff. 

Now at first I felt uncomfortable and my husband reassured me saying that as my step kids live with their mom it’s only natural they’ll see my side of the family less. He isn’t bothered. However I really didn’t feel right in my soul that she seemed to purposefully exclude my 2 step kids. 

Also my grandma isn’t exactly poor so it’s not a financial thing. Last week me and my biokids and step kids rocked up to her place to bring over groceries. She handed my bio children $20 each and gave my step kids some chocolate. the kids thanked grandma. 

When we got home I decided it would be fair to take the cash and split it 4 ways so each kid received $10. I also equally handed out the chocolate. 

My grandma called up later to thank me for the groceries and asked what the kids were going to spend their cash on. I used that moment to explain I had redistributed it to be fair and she grew very angry with me and started to snap through the phone that I had no right to do that. I asked if she was purposefully treated my kids differently and she sighed in a real exasperated tone and said ‘well, they’re my bio kids and then there are a couple kids I see every few months... what the hell do YOU think?’"
"AITA for talking about my dog to be part of the conversation when my coworkers talk about their babies? | I work in a satellite office with four female coworkers, we are all aged 28-38. I'm the youngest and the only one who doesn't have a child. Two of my coworkers, Lena and Bree, have elementary school-aged children while the other two, Josie and Marion, each have a year-old child. 

Children and childcare are often topics of lunch chats. Josie and Marion are always excited to tell us what their babies are doing while Lena and Bree like giving advice about what to do with the babies. As I said, I don't have a child of my own but I have a very sweet seven year old shih tzu, Kimmy, who I love to bits. I know he's not the same as a baby and in no way do I consider myself a mom just because I have Kimmy, but whenever Josie and Marion talk about their babies, I find that there are a lot of things that the babies and Kimmy do similarly so when there's an instance of that I share it with them. 

For example, Marion said that if she scolds her baby, then he will ignore her when she tries to call him afterwards. I told the group, ""Aw, Kimmy does that as well! If I tell him no more treats he will lie down and sulk and won't look at my if I try to call him after."" They usually just laugh and tell me that maybe I need to have my own baby now. 

Last week we had a new coworker come in who will also be assigned to our office from now on. Gemma is pregnant with her first children, twins, and the other day I overheard her asking Lena if I always talk about Kimmy whenever the topic of children comes up. Lena said yes I do that a lot because I don't have children of my own. Gemma said that's really sad and I should realize that dogs aren't children so I shouldn't be talking about Kimmy when we talk about children. I was shocked to hear that because I never thought there was a problem with what I'm doing and walked away before I could hear what Lena said because I think I would really be hurt and embarrassed if I hear her tell Gemma that she agrees with what Gemma said. 

So AITA and should I stop sharing about my dog whenever my coworkers talk about their babies?"
"AITA for getting my boss in trouble when she was the one who helped me get the job | So this lady (F32) who is a family friend of mine, helped me get a job a few months ago. I (F25) never met her before I started the job, but she still put her name on line to help me out. After working for a couple months, I realized she was kind of a bully who would talk down to people.

Well recently, our Executive Director (Jim) sent us BOTH (and CC’d my boss Tommy) an email and asked “Can someone help with this task?” I was planning on working on it, but I was busy and I wasn’t able to respond to the email. Plus, Jim has repeatedly asked us to not to respond to emails. Just get the task done which is another reason I didn’t respond. 

24 hours pass by and she responds to the email saying “Hey (my name) did you take care of this?” 1 min later my boss (Tommy) responds “She’s busy right now. Can you take care of it?” She sends a reply and says “Sure, but (my name) can you please respond to emails so I can help complete the task?” 

I didn’t even have a chance to respond to the email and she sends me this text: “(my name). I understand you are busy, we all are, but can you please respond back to emails regarding tasks. It’s not professional to not and I know Tommy is always protecting you and that you more than likely will show him this, but as human to human will you please just do me that favor. I PROMISE you I am 💯 happy to contribute to things but if things are just left sitting it doesn’t look good. Obviously Tommy doesn’t mind it, but trust me in the outside world it’s not normal to just ignore emails like that. Also, don’t mean to be coming at you at all, but please just help me help YOU ultimately. 🙏🏽”

I didn’t take this lightly because for 1. She was saying I’m not professional 2. She also didn’t respond to email until 24 hours later, which she then asked if I had completed it instead of asking if I needed help (assuming I would take care of it) 3. She was really upset at my boss (which she has mentioned to me many times before) and instead of taking it up with him, she decided to message me 4. I had been working overtime for 2 weeks with a bunch of tasks I had to complete on my own and I wasn’t able to respond to that message on time.

So I sent her a long message explaining myself with those 4 points. I was very nice and didn’t say anything degrading, just let her know my situation.. (I would add it in here, but it’s too long for the post. Might be able to post it in the comments). She got offended and sent me this: “you are a Coordinator and I am a Director. Please don’t be disrespectful. Any other company would not put up with the behavior but apparently you “know all” so I’ll let you sit here and think that.”

I immediately contacted our Executive Director, Jim. She got in trouble and had to call me to apologize, which she didn’t. She just explained her text message to me. Now, she has turned all of my coworkers against me and they’re all disrespectful towards me. Am I the asshole and should I just have kept my mouth shut?"
"AITA for dressing like a ""festival thot"" (as my boyfriend called it) when I went out last night? | Using a throwaway to post this. I go to university at a pretty big school and commencement was last weekend. It's a tradition that goes back to when my parents were students that this local bar holds a last call for the students that are left in town. It's a huge deal and pretty much the best and most fun night of the year. 

I decided to go all out last night with my best festival gear, I wont be graphic but I showed a ton of skin and I felt amazing and had a great time, but I did have some ""exposures"" because my top was so skimpy, but it was sort of in the spirit of the night.

 My boyfriend is already out of town so he didn't go with me but I guess he was looking at my Instagram and like lost his mind. We have a great relationship and we talk often about getting married and having kids so his point is that what would our kids think if the pictures of me with my pierced and exposed nipples get out. 

I definitely asking because I can see his point and maybe I went a little overboard. But I think his term ""you looked like a festival thot"" was not cool at all. 

Can I get a good judgment if I was the asshole or not?"
"AITA for not telling a waiter I was undercharged? | Last night, my fiancee and I went to a semi-fancy restaurant to enjoy a nice quiet dinner together. We don't do this too often, but it feels good to get a little dressed up and have some good Italian food every once in a while. This time, she had a Groupon that was $63 off for four glasses of wine, two apps, and four main courses. We asked the waiter right at the beginning if we could order two of the main courses to go since there were only two of us, and she said no problem (not part of the assholery, I want to be clear that we weren't trying to trick anyone).

So we have a great meal, ordered our two other main courses to go, then asked for the check. This is where the potential assholery begins. Every item was accounted for on the check, and the total came out to $115 before tax. This meant we should have paid about $60 before tip when all was said and done. Not too bad. HOWEVER, we looked down at the total, and it said something like $7.32, which was just the tax. My fiancee figured we were just misunderstanding the check, as a lot of it was written by hand, so we put down the credit card. Then the receipt came back for a $7.32 total. We were surprised, to say the least, but also pretty excited at the prospect of having an extra $50 in our pocket.

Then my fiancee began to wonder if we should tell anyone. Nobody mentioned that our meal would be comped, and she was worried that someone put it in wrong and would get in trouble for it later. I said that it was fine, our waitress probably knew what she was doing, and not to look a gift horse in the mouth. We ended up not telling anybody, and my fiancee even said on the way out that she thought our waitress gave her a knowing nod as we thanked her.

So AITA (AWTA?) for not telling anyone about this potentially accidental comped meal? Also, since I think this is very relevant, we tipped $30, a 25% tip on the full amount of the check.

EDIT: Welp, seems like both misunderstood how Groupons work! Her parents got the Groupon for her/us, and it said $63 on it, but it looks like that's what they paid for it. After these comments I understand that I definitely, 100% would have been the asshole here, and I'm glad I know so I don't pull this shit in the future. But thankfully nobody got in trouble because there was no fuckup."
"AITA For saying she can't any of my liquor? | My girl wanted have to some of my liquor but wanted to to mix with a $2 soda. I said ""nah bottle is too expensive ($130) for you to be wasting it with some cheap ass soda"". ""If you want some it has to be straight or on the rocks"". She told me it was just ""alcohol it's not that serious"" was tempted to give her some attitude back but I didn't. In the end she never had none. Was I an asshole for that move,?"
"AITA for saying my boyfriend needs to come to mass or go home? | We're both atheists but I was raised Catholic and my family are mostly Roman Catholic. He keeps saying he wants my family to like him and I can see this relationship being a rest of our lives type of thing, so I would also like them to like him.

My family goes to midnight mass every year, which starts at 11 on Christmas Eve and wraps up after midnight on Christmas. It's really boring and I hate going, but I'm going because all of my family will be there, not just my parents and siblings, but extended family like cousins, uncles and aunts, and my grandparents. My grandparents are the head of the family and the most religious, and if they don't like my boyfriend then the whole family will turn on him. When he told me he wanted to meet my family I told him that they are the most important people to get on his side. They consider the mass to be something of a litmus test. You don't have to be religious for them to like you, but you do need to show respect for my family's beliefs.

It does not mean that they need to convert or take part in the religion, but if they can sit through mass without checking their phone, then that'll do. I, personally, am torn on this ""test"", because I can barely sit through the 1hr30 of mass, and I've been going for 27 years, but I do get the respect element, as their faith is important to them.

My boyfriend says he doesn't see the point of sitting through a religious service when he doesn't believe in it, but that's what I'm doing. I don't believe in it either, but I am going because my entire family, including the non religious ones, the ones who married into it, and the ones who belong to other faiths are going, because it's about my family all being together, and it's important to me that my family like him, which they won't do if he just skips out on mass because he ""can't be arsed"" (his words).

He keeps saying he's worried my family won't like him, but if he stays home while everyone else goes to church, that's exactly what will happen. I wish he'd told me before coming here for Christmas that he wasn't going to take part in anything religious, because I would have worked something else out so he didn't have to be meeting them in peak religious season. I made it clear beforehand that if he is coming with me for Christmas then Christmas mass was part of that and he said he'd go.

I explained all this to him and he shut down on me, saying that he just didn't want to. I hate giving ultimatums but eventually I said that if he felt this strongly about not going, then I can tell them he got called into work last minute and had to go home, and I could join him in a couple of days, but he can't be here and not come to mass and still expect my family to like him.

He feels that I'm being ridiculous and it's no big deal if he just doesn't go, but he doesn't know my family. If he refuses to go to mass then the only way he can come out of this with my family having a good opinion of him is him having a work emergency, so I told him if he's not going to mass then he's going home.

AITA?

Edit: No one is asking him to convert or becomes suddenly religious from one service. This is the one and only time he'd have to go. Ideally it would be every year, but he has never met my extended family so if he were willing to just go this one time and make a good first impression then he could get out of it every year after this. If he goes this one time and we say afterwards that he tried it but it's not his thing then my grandparents would thank him for trying and respect his sincerity. This is 90 minutes of sitting in silence while wearing a clean shirt and not playing on his phone and in exchange my family love him forever.

He chose to come meet them at Christmas. I made clear that this would require him coming to midnight mass and he agreed. I also made it clear that if he had chosen any other time of year then he would never have to go to any sort of mass, but he said Christmas worked best for him. Now he has come for Christmas, he has 3 options: 1. go to mass and my grandparents will love him, 2. skip the one strictly religious element of Christmas and don't be surprised when my grandparents are offended for what they will view as a snub against their religion, and 3. have a ""work emergency"" and try again some other time."
"AITA For not wanting to holiday with mum? | TL;DR: I want to go discover myself whilst studying abroad, Mum wants to tag along for a bit. Do I crush her dream by telling her I don’t want her to?

Later this year, I’m [18M] planning to go on study abroad to the UK for about 4 months. My mother [46F] is very excited about this and has suggested we holiday around continental Europe for 2 weeks before I get to the UK. 

Now don’t get me wrong; I love my mum more than anything and our personalities are really compatible and we get along well. However I’m not keen to go on holiday with her. 

Firstly, we just got back from a holiday overseas together (with other family) that was enjoyable but in no way relaxing due to us all liking different ways to travel. 

This trip of studying abroad will be my first time living out of home and I was kind of hoping for it to be a discover-myself kind of trip and I feel spending two weeks straight in close company to my mum will not be a great start to that. 

Also I can only be overseas for a certain amount of time due to medical reasons and the more time I spend with Mum the less I get to myself. 

Here’s a summary of the reasons that I feel bad about not wanting to go:
- Mum is super excited about it and I don’t want to crush this dream
- We are not rich and mum’s more than willing to spend lots of money on the trip
- My Mum had breast cancer last year and I feel like this is a pick-me-up she really wants. 

Mum’s brought it up around my grandma who thankfully said I wouldn’t want to do that, which my mum unfortunately ignored. I’ve tried to hint I’m not super enthusiastic about it but have not explicitly stated I don’t want it do it. 

Should I suck it up and go with her or tell her I don’t want to do it? Before you roast me I know this is the most first-world problem ever but it’s still a dilemma. 

Also if it makes a difference I’m paying for the study abroad with money I’ve worked for myself. "
"AITA for wishing my friend (24F) didn’t follow my partner (23M) and I (27F) to live in a tropical island because she’s making our time here a bit shit? | So I have this friend (let’s call her Amy). We’ve been friends for a couple of years through uni and work. She is fun and positive and I considered her a good friend. 

To cut a long story short, I got offered a job teaching in the Pacific Islands as a teacher. 
Of course I accepted the job and told my family and friends - including Amy. All my friends joked about coming too and I always said “yes please come too!” knowing no one would. 
However Amy took it literally and then within the next hour she had sent her CV out to a bunch of schools - including the one I got offered a job at and then got a job there too. 
I was upset at first, and probably still am. This was a unique experience that I’d always dreamed of and I kinda wanted to keep it for myself. Selfish as that sounds but I worked my ass off and out myself out there for this job.

Fast forward to now and because the school pays for our accommodation, we three are living in a small apartment and me and Amy are working at the school. 
After three months here instead of being a nice and fun friend she now purposely excludes me from things she knows I would enjoy doing e.g. she has been playing my favourite sport without telling me so I wouldn’t try to join the team, she makes little digs at me constantly at home, she is super loud around the house and is always rushing around - she is a very intense energy to be around (my partner and I are super calm and quiet people). She’s also rude and demanding to the principal at work which is super embarrassing. 

Today after work I was so tired and excited to go straight to bed for a nap and I walked inside the house and she had a group of our colleagues around. They were all laughing, eating snacks and making cocktails. I got so upset that 1. I was so tired and I had to deal with people in my private space while feeling like that, and 2. I wasn’t invited to the party. 
I went to my room and shut the door and they all started whispering and laughing and ran upstairs.

It breaks my heart that I essentially invited her to come with us and she’s just making me upset or angry so much of the time. 

Am I being selfish or over the top? 
AITA for wanting to tell her she needs to remember she followed us here so she needs to start treating us with more respect? 

TLDR; A friend followed my bf and I to a new country for a job and lives with us. Now she’s making our time here a bit shit."
"AITA for telling my wife to pay attention to our 3 year old who left the room sad because “mom won’t play with me” | So here is the back story.  I work full time and sometimes two jobs since my wife won’t work. She says it’s too much to deal with kids and work.  She has been sick today in her defense and I am VERY aware that a stay at home mom job is extremely draining and full time as well.   

Here is where I have some frustrations.  When I was working two jobs she would get mad that I wasn’t doing the dishes or the laundry or cleaning the bathrooms when I would leave at 7 am and get home at midnight or later 6 days a week.  Also she would stress the importance of giving the kids time and attention (which I completely agree is vital).  When I get home during my normal work week (one job only now) I play with the kids, make my own dinner, and then usually do bedtime with the kids and lay in their room till they fall asleep. Then I get to anything I wanted to try and do at home that day and finally sit and watch a tv show or something in bed on the iPad (usually my wife is trying to go to sleep now so I massage her legs while I watch)

So tonight really pissed me off because she was watching tv and has been sick today.  I’m fine with taking the kids all day on days like this.  I took them to church, played all day, did laundry, and the dishes today.  While I was putting away laundry our 3 year old kept trying to get my wife’s attention while she was cuddling with our 6 year old.  She finally left the room and said “I’m going to bed”.  That never happens so I went to check on her.  She said mom won’t play with me (she said look at this and my wife was too focused on the tv. So then my daughter said “mom, I love you...” and my wife said nothing because of the tv). This pissed me off so I said to my wife that or daughter was sad since she wasn’t getting her attention and my wife shrugged her shoulders like it was no big deal.  This pissed me off so I said that she shouldn’t dare shrug her shoulders like it’s no big deal her daughter was sad.  We started to fight and she pulled the whole I play everyday with them (I don’t disagree with that. She does, but also she goes out weekly with her friends and I always make sure they give her space when I’m home.) I said that’s great but she doesn’t need to play the victim over it and recognize that the fact that a 3 year old felt the need to leave the room and be sad is a big deal.  So am I the asshole here?

"AITA for cutting off my daughter from her inheritance money due to her drug use? | My mother passed away 8 years ago, and left my family with a money from her property. She left my daughter $50K, but my daughter was only 12 at the time. So, I put my daughter’s $50K into a my savings account and saved it for college. 

When my daughter went to college, I signed her name onto the account and made my savings into joint one. I also made a new savings account for myself. My daughter will periodically move money from the savings account into her own account and just notify me of this. 

However, I recently found out through social media that my daughter has been abusing drugs and partying almost daily. And not like weed or shrooms, cocaine and other party drugs while drinking. I also noticed that she was going through the savings account rather rapidly, to a concerning degree. 

I tried to convince my daughter to go to rehab, but she refused because she doesn’t think she’s doing anything wrong. So, I moved all the money into my new savings account. I told my daughter she will get all the money back if she goes to rehab. In the meantime, I will reimburse her living expenses if she provides receipts. 

My daughter feels entitled to this money because it was legally hers, but I have a responsibility to keep her safe, even if she won’t keep herself safe. She will run out of money soon if she keeps using it on drugs, and she won’t have a safety net. AITA here?"
"WIBTA for not getting my brother anything for his 13th birthday? | He's turning 13 in 10 days. At this stage, there are very few things he could ask for that would ship in time. I've been asking him to choose some stuff since the start of March, and he's always said he'd tell me closer to the time but ""don't get me anything unless I pick it"". I want to clarify, he's a good kid, not super entitled, just has a history of getting bad presents (both from me and other family members but our intentions were good).

So now, after 6 weeks of me asking him to pick stuff, he has exactly 10 days to go. I've asked him to pick stuff, he's still saying his birthday is ""ages"" away and he'll choose something later, despite me regularly saying that deliveries are taking longer lately and I can't guarantee it'll arrive in time. I told mum, truthfully, that ""I've got half a mind to just not buy him anything because he's not picked anything out"".

Mum then starts laying into me, saying I have to get him something, it's his 13th, he only gets one, and I shouldn't even joke about it. I then went to talk to my brother again and reminded him that I need to order ASAP or it won't arrive in time, and he again, told me that he'd pick something ""later"" and to stop nagging.

WIBTA if I just didn't get him anything?"
"AITA for not paying for my friend's hospital bill | AITA go gentle on me.

Roommate's cat is afraid of new animals. Roommate was out of town, and I had some people over. DogeFriend brought his dog (without asking). DogeFriend has asked to bring doge over before, and it's normally ok.

I locked the cat in roommate's bedroom, where water/food/litter box is. But also where the bathroom is. Cat got out, so we start looking for it. Found it hiding, but it was really scared of the new people, noise, and probably smell of dog. Cat ran from behind bookcase to behind couch, while I'm trying to wrangle it. Dog sees cat, starts barking, and trying to chase the cat, while DogeFriend (ineffectively) trying to tell dog to chill out.

Cat is hiding behind couch, hissing at us. Everybody is yelling ""grab the cat"" ""put it in the room"". I'm trying to make my way over to the cat, but friend , we'll say Mr. Grabby Hands, is closer. Mr. GrabbyHands goes to scruff cat - but has no experience wrangling kitties, and grabs too far away from the neck, so cat turns around and sinks her teeth into his hand.

No blood from the wound, so we apply antiobiotic ointment and bandage the hand, give Mr. Grabby Hands some ibuprofen, all go to bed. Next morning it's swollen, GrabbyHands goes to urgent care and gets antiobiotics. We feel bad for GrabbyHands, offer to pay, but his insurance covered it all.

Mr. GrabbyHands drives home. Turns out, he wakes up the next day feeling really sick. Ends up going to the ER, stays overnight 3 days! Despite the antiobiotics, the wound became infected. He had to be put on an antiobiotic IV. 

GrabbyHands doesn't even tell me - I find out from someone else. Contact GrabbyHands and find out his hospital bill was $2000! I offer to pay half, splitting it with DogeFriend, and GrabbyHands left with the other half. AITA?

Friends saying I make significantly more money then GrabbyHands, the incident happened at my place, and it was my roommate's cat. But I think it's GrabbyHands' decision to grab the cat, whereas I was ready to grab the cat myself.

EDIT: worth mentioning Mr Grabby Hands lost 3 days of work, already paid $500 out-of-pocket for ER copay. His work is very physical, and is hourly (not my fault, or my choice, but food for thought). Also, DogeFriend backed out and isn’t helping pay."
"WIBTA if I told a classmate to shut up in class | So I'm a college student and am currently in a Social Psych class that's heavily discussion oriented and participation is 10% of our grade. Students raise hands and contribute all the time, myself included. I actually really enjoy the class. But one of my classmates is too active in the conversation, and its getting to the point where he's quite obnoxious imo.

He'll randomly blurt out as the professor is speaking, most of the time without raising his hand, completely disrupting the flow of the lecture. Sometimes laughably he'll raise his hand and just say whatever he has to say anyways without being called on. Everyone else raises their hand and waits their turn to contribute, He seems like a smart guy, sometimes what he says is actually insightful. Other times it's unnecessary tangent that contributes little if anything. He must blurt out at least 15 times per 2 hour lecture, and sadly I'm not exaggerating.

It's getting to the point where I want to catch him outside of class and tell him he needs to either stop blurting out so much or just raise his fucking hand. It literally affects our grade when he takes over the conversation. Our professor is quite nice so I doubt she'd actually do anything about it on her own. In reality I'd be much more tactful about it than just telling him to shut up, but is it my place to confront him about this?

UPDATE: Just wanted to put this in here that I sent an email to my professor about speaking after class next week when I have the class again. I will not be approaching my classmate. Hopefully she comes up with something that all 3 of us and the class can work with."
"AITA for not letting my brother in the house? | (Yes this is about being sick but not c word sick)




I (30M) am married with 2 kids (2 and 1). My family has the tendency to drop by pretty much whenever they feel like it. It has caused issues between my wife and me in the past because sometimes she would come home from work and my mom would be cleaning the kitchen, my brother's kids would be there watching tv, etc.We have tried to institute a call first policy, but that only works 50% of the time.  






My wife and 1 year old woke up with either a stomach bug or food poisoning. My brother mentioned coming by this weekend, so I shot him a text telling him to not come over as 1) They are miserable and 2) I don't know if it is contagious. 






My brother is saying they are still coming today. He has the mindset that kids get sick and sick kids aren't a reason to stop living life. I know what will happen if he comes over. He will tell his 4 kids to only stay outside, they will whine and complain, and he will let them in the house. My wife will then have to watch them (all under 5) and our children while she feels like shit. He wouldn't listen to me saying no so I snapped and told him ""Fine, come over. I just won't let you in."" 






He is pissed. He told my sister and parents. I'm getting texts from all of them about how family can come and go as they please and we have no right to stop them from coming into our home. They are ranting about ""How dare us not be accommodating"" and us being horrible hosts. I'm ignoring the texts but I feel guilty. My family has always had an open door policy and it has been a slight issue that my wife isn't as welcoming 24/7 as the rest of the family. They all think we are being assholes for refusing them entry to our house. 






So, AITA for saying I won't let him in? 








TL;DR wife and baby have stomach bug and I told my family they can't come over"
"AITA for being upset that my fiancee is going to a wedding I was uninvited to? | So my fiancee's friend is getting married in the spring. Originally we were both invited to the wedding, but I was then uninvited last night, when the bride and groom realized they didnt have enough in the budget to invite anyone's +1 unless they paid a hefty fee ($250ish a person)

While I understand that mistakes happen, I'm a little sad and wish they would have made it no plus 1 for anyone from the beginning, instead of inviting and uninviting half the wedding guests. 

I'm feeling a little hurt, rejected and really upset that my fiancee wouldn't even consider going halves on it with me, but he made it pretty clear that he wasnt changing his mind on taking me. He says I'm overthinking it, but I feel left out and like I dont matter. Not from the bride and groom, but for my fiancee refusing to see my side of this. I also want to make it clear that I will NOT be keeping him from going. Am I the asshole?

Edit: okay since I keep getting the same questions:

1.Fiancee will be attending the wedding, whether I go or not

2. I hold no anger towards anyone, I understand things happen

3. The REAL QUESTION here is, Am I an Asshole for feeling the way I do, despite the fact that I'm not gonna push the issue any further?"
"AITA for sleeping with my dead best friends girlfriend? | A few weeks ago, my best friend since childhood overdosed and died. This was obviously devastating. 


His girlfriend has been in a similar emotional state to me and has been one of the few people I’ve been able to handle being with since he died. I know that most people have good intentions but their questions and sympathy bother me, as they do her.


His family were never great and she’s not from our city, I live at home and she’s spent a few nights in our guest room as she has struggled being alone in the home they shared together. 


I always got on with her and have had a little crush on her since they started dating but I never would have moved on her whilst they were together.


The other night we slept together. It was stupid and I regret it but it came from a place of grief and wasn’t to do with my feelings for her. I just missed my friend and she misses him too. She left early the next morning but my parents worked it out and have told me I’m basically a horrible person who took advantage of her.


She’s not spoken to me since which hurts as I need her in my life rn.


I’m grieving as well and although this was a regrettable decision, I don’t think I’m a bad person or should be judged by my parents for this.

AITA?"
"AITA for wanting to wait before kissing my GF? | For some context I'm 15M and my GF (15F) and I just got together about a month back. I really, really like her, and I enjoy spending time with her and all but recently we started talking about kissing
Well, I haven't kissed anyone yet and neither has she, and we both do want to kiss each other, but the thing is, I know how important a first kiss is  as a memory to girls and I want it to be really really perfect for the both of us. My GF meanwhile just wants me to kiss her already. 
AITA for asking her to wait so I could make it really special?"
"WIBTA for insisting on a +1 for a wedding. I am the best man. | I've known the groom for over a decade and he asked me to be his best man.

Upon getting the link to make an online reservation I noticed I did not get a plus one. I asked the bride about this and she told me the wedding party is not getting plus ones. I was a bit salty(I did not express this, its their day) but understanding if it applied to everyone else.

&#x200B;

6 weeks out from the wedding and I found out another groomsman is bringing his non live in girlfriend. I've talked with several people to find out if it's common for the best man to not get a plus one and the all around consensus is 'It's weird'.

&#x200B;

I kindly sent the following to the groom:

&#x200B;

' Hey Groom, I’ve been meaning to ask you something in regards to the wedding. GF and I have been getting very serious with our relationship (currently apartment shopping for when my lease ends!). It would mean a lot to me if you allotted me +1 to bring her! '

&#x200B;

He declined saying it would go against their vision of the wedding and some budget restrictions.

&#x200B;

Tux rental was about $200 and I haven't even looked at hotel accommodations yet.

&#x200B;

Wedding is over 1 month away.

&#x200B;

EDIT: The bride has found this post (like within 3 hours, less than 100 upvotes, less than 100 comments. Kind of impressed) and honestly I feel pretty shitty about it. This was mostly supposed to be a cathartic venting session,  I don't think I've spoken ill of anyone or given personal information away."
"AITA for wanting gifts for all five kids? | My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. For more than a year now, he and I and our combined 5 kiddos have happily lived together. An issue continues to rear its ugly head with my family... they don’t make my boyfriend’s 3 children feel included. 

Any event that includes gift-giving seems centered around my 2. I understand that my family didn’t get a vote on how many kiddos I have, but shouldn’t they all suck it up and buy each of them a little something for Christmas, too?

Ex: All 5 kids are in need of winter apparel, I have a list on the fridge of each item that’s needed. My mom sees the list and offers to buy the items my 2 kids need. I was speechless. While it would be very helpful, given our current finances, I feel like I should decline, given the overt exclusion of the other kids’ needs. 

So, take what I can get? (I’m the asshole for expecting more.)

Or

Tell them all or none? (They’re the asshole for caring for only my 2 kids.)

Thank you!

EDIT for more info:

Both of my brothers are with women that already had a kid... my parents buy things for them, marriage or no. 

We are planning to marry, my family knows this. 

Bf’s family is not nearby and quite destitute, yet they have still treated my 2 kiddos as their own grandchildren. 

I have spoken with my family about this. I’ve told them I understand that they didn’t get a vote on how many kids I have, but that I love them like they’re my own and that I’d appreciate them feeling included. I suggested maybe easily shareable gifts like boardgames."
"AITA for accidentally ejaculating inside of my girlfriend? | For reference both myself (M 19) and my girlfriend (F 18) were virgins up until this point. 

&#x200B;

We'd been planning to lose our virginities and decided on Friday (26th April).

I had spoken to her about protection as i had read a lot of things online about guys ejaculating quickly when it is their first time -- she told me that she did not want to use a condom as she 'doesn't like rubber because it feels like nylon '(??) and that i can pull out before that happens. 

I will save you the details but long story short is that i ejaculated inside of her within the first minute and she got up and left. 

&#x200B;

Now she has barely spoken to me, is very short with her messages and is mad at me because this is life-ruining."
"AITA for being mad at my parents for choosing church over my son's first birthday party? | My parents go to church every Sunday. And Wednesday for bible study. And Thursday for band rehearsal. Originally mom said she was going to go to church and come over after and drop off presents because by the time church gets out it would almost be over because the party is starting kind of early and my son's father has to go leave for work at 2:30. My dad quit his full time job due to his Parkinson's getting really bad so it's hard for him to go anywhere and stay long because his medication barely lasts for like an hour or 2 at a time and he can only take it so often so I understand that. But since I came home from visiting family across country 2 months ago he has only seen my son twice, my mom a bit more. They said they couldn't find anyone to play guitar when I asked a while ago. I told them at some point I would have told the church too bad it's my grandson's birthday especially since they told them almost 2 weeks ago and my parents said they didn't think it was that important. I told them not to come at all then all of the sudden they said they would come and just cancel church then if it was so important. I get that my son won't remember the party anyway but its the point I think. Other key points here are that when I was young I had multiple parties where I invited a ton of kids and maybe like 2 kids showed up and I just think it's kind of messed up that they saw that and don't mind not coming to my kid's parties growing up. I just don't think a day of church service is more important than my son's special day. You can worship god and not feel required to go to church everyday. I am also not religious at all though so I think they get defensive when I say this. Thirdly they have chosen other things over me many times. Drugs, and my ex I broke up with over 2 years ago still lives there rent free who I keep asking to tell him to gtfo and they haven't still. Thoughts?

Tl;dr parents go to church all the time, mom sees my kid a decent amount, dad doesn't due to parkinsons yet goes to church all the time. They said they didn't think it was that important to call of going to church because dad plays in the church band. I flipped out and they said they'll come now but its going to be drama most likely.

Edit: look I'm accepting my judgement I just feel like a paragraph isn't enough to give proper context in things like these. You get people asking for info and people saying things are irrelevant. I don't want to argue I just am wondering if I properly represented my case. I also feel like context can be pretty important as in I'm saying yes I may not have taken their feelings into consideration even though it was the only day that even barely worked however it seems very rare they take my feelings into consideration. Wasn't going out of the way to be an asshole in the first place."
"AITA for leaving my best friend when he got pulled over for a DUI? | Hi, I have only read reddit post up until now. I have something in my chest that I can't hold onto anymore. This happened about 3 weeks ago.

So the story: My friend just graduated from college and got a job at a different state. I was /am very happy for him and I wanted to celebrate with him. I asked him to hang out and originally we were going to go fishing, but he had to stay late and we ended up meeting in the afternoon. After a few minutes we did a coin toss on who was driving and it was him. We went to the first bar and ate, then we moved to a second bar had a few beers and left to go to the 3rd bar. Here is where it gets stupid.

We stayed in this bar for a while. I kept buying drinks and everything was on me. I'm not gonna lie, I drank way more than I could handle, we met some dude and he started drinking with us and I remember was me smoking a cigarette with them. I then browned out..... and when I woke up in a car, the dude on the passenger seat and then my buddy on the driver seat. I thought everything was okay until I heard ""yes, officer."" I was stunned, I didn't know what to do. I was also very drunk at this moment and started throwing up... A lot. At this moment the dude in the passenger seat told the officer that I was very sick and he needed to get me out. the dude pulled me to the side of the street away from view( i think) and I proceeded to vomit everywhere.... I asked him about my friend and told him I did not want to leave. But he insisted and told me that if I stay I would just get him in more trouble and get in trouble myself. Me being drunk, I got scared and just went with him. The dude got his friend ( or maybe his girlfriend) to pick us up and told me that I should fill up her car since they were helping me get home and I did it, it would be the same price for an uber anyway.

I got home, I tried contacting his family but my phone died and it had throw up on it and I was not able to charge it due to moisture. I tried to instagram message his brother. I tried for an hour or so but I was so drunk I couldn't even log in to my instagram. I then passed out and I woke up sober, panicking that I FUCKING LET MY BEST FRIEND SLEEP IN JAIL. I then called the jail to pay his bail or get him out, but they informed me that he was going to be released in a few hours. His brother contacted me and I told him everything, I tried contacting him when he got out but he never picked up or responded.


Am I the asshole here for not planning ahead and leaving my friend because I thought it would be for the best?

Honestly, I am sorry, I should've been more responsible and I hope you're doing well bro. I understand that you don't want to talk to me anymore because I left and you should be angry because I left you and I shouldn't have done that. I honestly thought that if I stayed I would have made it worse for you and I thought I could go home and get you out as soon as I could. I fucked up man."
"AITA for calling a club owner a “short little leprechaun” and telling him that he would never find a girlfriend after not taking down a Facebook photo of me? | throwaway because some work colleagues know my real account.

Last weekend I (22F) went to a club with a few of my best friends. My friends all look absolutely gorgeous and get approached by men a lot. I’m going to be completely honest and say that I’m definitely not as attractive. I’m not overweight, but I’m definitely chubby, I’m 5’11,  and I have a large, crooked nose and small eyes. I know I’m not that attractive, but I’ve come to terms with my cruel hand in the genetic lottery. Anyways, I never usually go clubbing, but it was my friend’s birthday. Let’s call this friend Eva. We were all dancing and having a good time when Eva approaches the club photographer and asks him to take a group picture of us. I hate taking photos because I feel really self-conscious, but it was Eva’s birthday so I smiled and posed in the group photo. Fast forward a couple of days later. The club posts all of the photos from the night, including our group photo. Literally all of the other photos had no caption, but our group photo had the caption, “Who’s up for a game of Russian Roulette?”. This was obviously alluding to the fact that I am ugly whilst my friends are all drop-dead gorgeous. Random people found the post hilarious and started sharing it on Facebook and tagging their friends. The photo had about 300 laugh reacts before I messaged the club’s Facebook page and asked if they could take the photo down. They told me to lighten up and that it was just a joke. I got really annoyed because they didn’t even apologize, so I messaged the club owner (his Facebook was public). He told me to “get a grip” and to “understand the humor of the situation”. Now, one thing about this guy: he’s quite short. Like, 5’1. He shares all of these Facebook posts about Tinder and how unfair it is to short men and how “fat landwhales can find a man easily”. So, I knew that his height was his biggest insecurity. But I was angry. So I told him to fuck off and told him that he would never find a girlfriend due to him being a short little leprechaun. Eva thinks I went too far, and she’s scared that our entire group will get banned from the club. AITA?"
"AITA for ""not supporting my girlfriend""? | My GF and I were on a public transit train where the seats in front of us faced us.  A couple about our age, mid to late twenties, sat down across from us.  The man across from us coughed a couple times and the first cough he didn't cover his face immediately but turned his head as to not cough towards our direction.  A couple seconds later my girlfriend pulls her shirt up over her face and holds it there. With a bit of an angry look.  I felt embarrassment that she did this and I asked what she is doing.  I was embarrassed cuz the couple is facing directly at us and it seemed like a rude thing to do.  She said she was trying to prevent getting sick.  I made the comment ""will that really prevent you from getting sick?"", and she got really upset with me.  Saying I don't support her and that it would help and I don't know more about her regarding medical issues.  She went to school for pre-med.  It turned into a big argument where we sat in silence for the next half hour.  

So AITA for making that comment and causing this argument?"
"AITA For outing my friend about her gastric bypass surgery? | Throwaway account. I know how this sounds, but hear me out. I have this friend, I’ll call her T that had gastric bypass surgery about 2 years ago. She’s been pretty discreet about the surgery and has only been open about it with family and close friends. I completely understand her wanting to be private about it even though it’s pretty obvious, as she lost quite a bit of weight in a really short amount of time. So here’s where the trouble is, recently T has made some pretty rude comments about a friend of mine (that she is not close with, but knows through mutual friends) who got a boob job. She was basically making fun of her and calling her shallow for getting plastic surgery in front of a group of people that didn’t even know this girl. After quite a few of these comments, I finally chimed in and said something to the extent of “shouldn’t you be the last person judging someone else for getting a surgery that altered their appearance?” I didn’t even say what the surgery was, but again to those who knew her before the surgery, it’s pretty obvious what I was taking about. She got very quiet and blew off my comment, but then later on in private said that it was fucked up of me to say that and that she had her surgery for “health reasons.” Mind you, she has had a range of health issues since her surgery due to her not complying with proper diet/exercise/avoiding alcohol etc. so it’s kind of a stretch for her to say that the ONLY reason she got her surgery was to be healthier. I think it’s great she had the surgery, regardless of her motivation to do so, and I’m glad she is happier with herself, but I don’t think it’s fair to criticize other people for electing to get surgery that will also make them happier with their body. So, AITA for calling out my friend for being hypocritical about her own appearance-altering surgery?"
"AITA for timing my coworkers smoke breaks? | I am a gas station attendant who is currently enrolled in college. I always work with this one older lady and she always seems to take forever when she goes out to smoke. Her breaks are usually about 6 or 7 times the whole 7 hours I am with her. One day I got fed up because she usually just sits at the other end of the counter and reads the newspaper while i take care of the majority of customers and do all the chores to keep the store clean, so i decided to start timing all of her breaks. Up until this point i did not take a break and once i saw that her breaks were over an hour almost every day I felt i could at least take a 45 minute break. Am I the asshole for using this to determine how long my breaks are?"
"AITA for not wanting to have any cake at my wedding? | Hi Reddit. So I am in the process of planning my wedding. I will be getting married soon-ish and it will be a pretty small wedding. It is going to be about 40 people. We will be getting married in our backyard. We have not spent all that much for the wedding as I am making my own wedding dress ( i am a hobby tailor ). We splurged on food and drinks tho.

I would guestimate that we have spent a little over 2k at the wedding. Which compared to other weddings is very cheap.

So now to the problem.

I hate cake. I can eat one bite and feel completely grossed out. I have tried different cakes. Cakes with no fondant, cakes that have a fruit filling, etc. But I just don't like them.

So I was thinking of swapping the cake by chocolate fondue with strawberries and maybe have some cupcakes on the side for everyone that does like cake. I also looked into cakes and they are expensive for weddings ( converted around 400 dollars ).

My future husband was not very thrilled by the idea. He isn't as sweet tooth but he wants to do that ""feeding each other the cake"" ritual thingy. My argument was, that we can feed each other the chocolate fondue and that I want to enjoy the moment, which I wouldn't with cake. He told me it was one bite and after that, we could have something else and order chocolate-covered strawberries if I wanted.

When talking to my best friend, he told me that my future husband was right. Also, that fondues were super messy and people would enjoy cake more than fondue. So his opinion was also that I should grind my teeth for a moment and to order some chocolate covered strawberries. I feel like I should not have to do that on our big day. I also think that my future husband is not so hot on the cake but on the ritual. But maybe I am being a bit of a bitch here. So Aita?

&#x200B;

Edit1: he doesn\`t want a small cake, he doesn't want pies. He wants a big beautiful wedding cake. The one that he has in mind costs about 450€ and is a 3 tier.And to point out, I hate cake. it is not a... if it's there I\`ll eat it. I will have the bite of cake for minutes in mouth trying to swallow it and after that my stomach closes up and I get nauseous. The last time I ate cake was when my mom made me a cake for my birthday and expected me to eat it   (the same thing happened here... minutes trying to swallow and then a queasy stomach the rest of the night

&#x200B;

Edit2: We came to a compromise. We are going to get a cheaper cake with strawberry toppings and he is going to feed me a strawberry and I am going to feed him a cake . Also, I find it comical that people really downvoted me for saying that the alcohol-free wedding was a request from my future husband and not from me."
"AITA for saying I didn't want to get lunch with my husband anymore? | Hey Reddit, 

I haven’t been able to concentrate all day because I feel like TA but I thought I’d ask the masses. 

My husband and I both live and work in Boston and we have pretty similar work schedules, leaving plenty of time in the evenings to be together. Over the past two weeks I enrolled in intensive therapy to help with an eating disorder so I’m away for most weeknights, not getting home until 9:30. I also need to get into the office by 8 AM to be able to leave early to get to the session on time. This has led to a lot of stress and overall lack of weekly happiness on my end. 

At the same time, my husband is having a really tough time at work. It’s a myriad of the usual problems—a boss that doesn’t care, too much work, no support, etc. The biggest problem is they canned his boss so now he has the workload of two people, no promotion, and they hire new people for his team but only in their Canadian office, not the one in Boston. So he still has no help with this and it’s been nearly a year. 

Our initial plan was to meet up for lunch on the weekdays because by the time I get home from therapy I end up simply going to bed because I’ve been out for 14+ hours. This would allow me to see him at least once during the day. Unfortunately, due to his work issues he hasn’t exactly been joyous during lunch. The past couple of times we’ve met up for lunch he’s been in a HORRIBLE mood due to experiencing some issue at work, whether it's a nasty email or another new hire in the Canada office. He’s unresponsive, unenthusiastic, and the entire time I’m on the verge of tears due to his lack of interest in cheering up and just hanging out with me. 

I’m having a really difficult time dealing with his bad mood during my one hour off in the entire day, so today I told him I couldn’t get lunch because “it stresses me out so much.” It did not go over well--he's not speaking to me. I feel horrible because he doesn’t have a big support system so I am the only one he has to talk to, but I need to try to have just one hour of a genuine break in the day to get me through the next 8-9 hours without his piss-poor attitude and sulking making our lives worse. AITA?

EDIT: I skipped therapy last night to go home. I apologized for how I behaved, we agreed to both be more positive during our lunches together, and he agreed to seek therapy (and will look for a new job as soon as he gets his end of year bonus)"
"AITA for insisting that my gf, who's NEVER handled a baby/kid before, gets mothering advice before we get a baby of our own? | My (22M) girlfriend (24M) and I were discussing our plans about having a kid recently. This discussion turned into a disagreement, before turning into an argument that left a bad taste in both of our mouths.

Now let me tell you, when it comes to having experience with handling kids, we're opposites. She's never even held a child in her arms before and I've handled my two younger siblings during my teenage years by myself, so the knowledge is still fresh with me.

Back to the story. She agreed that she'd be the SAHM  and I'd be the breadwinner and I told her, ""well in that case, you have to start learning how to handle a kid. I can help you."" She said no, she doesn't need help and that she can learn on the job since she'd be attending to the baby 24/7 and has lots of time to do so anyway.

I told her handling a baby isn't going to be that easy and the least she could do is get advice from the internet or from me in person, but she kept on refusing.

We got into an argument about it, me saying that the risks are too great and it'd be best if she just plays it safe and her saying that I worry too much and I'm not ""trusting"" her and that I can leave the babysitting to her since I'd be the breadwinner anyway.

I knew this was going nowhere and wanted a different perspective from this. So I asked my parents and older sister (who's a mother) and I'm half-right and half-wrong according to them, which lead me to this subreddit.

Jury of Reddit, give me your judgement on this. I'm waiting."
"AITA for kissing my friends girlfriend? | Title sounds bad, but let me explain. I (19M) was at a party and my friend (Jacob) and his girlfriend were there. This was the first time I met his girlfriend. Another friend brought some molly for a few of us, this was our first time trying it but we were with a couple people who had done it before. Molly makes you very happy and confident and makes you very affectionate towards people. Jacob, his girlfriend, me and 3 others all took some. We were all talking and it came up how we each lost our virginity. I told them that I was still a virgin and that I had never had a first kiss. Jacob's girlfriend offered to give me my first kiss and I said ""no I couldn't do that to Jacob"" (who was in this conversation). He said it was fine if I wanted to since it didn't mean anything, so we started making out. Jacob saw the whole thing and kind of congratulated me afterwards.

The next day I was talking to Jacob about the party and said it was funny how I kissed his girlfriend. He had clearly forgotten about it until now and got annoyed. He told me I shouldn't of kissed her and the only reason he said it was okay was because of the molly and alcohol. I said that me and his girlfriend were also on the same drugs as him so he couldn't really blame us if that was his excuse for allowing it. He said it is different and we shouldn't of actually gone through with it even if he did say it was okay.

AITA for kissing his girlfriend?"
"WIBTA for figuratively and possibly literally telling my niece to cover up? | My wife's niece is visiting and staying with us for a week. I'm all for being independent, grown up, and exploring your freedom, I'd rather she not do it under my roof with my teenage boys around.

My wife left for a business trip and my niece is taking it as a cue to let loose. Shorts so short they're glorified belts. The skimpiest of shirts, and worse.
WIBTA if I tell her, or get my wife to tell her some simple rules:

* Wear enough (bra or a thicker shirt) to cover your nipples

* Shorts that come at least somewhat down your legs.

* No lounging in just a towel except in your room. 

WIBTA here?"
"AITA for disputing a charge at a sandwich place after they completely messed up my order? | I know it definitely sounds like I’m the asshole but hear me out!! 

Before I went to work, I went to a popular sandwich chain and placed my order in person. They have 3 breads: white, wheat, and cheddar. I order cheddar and the roast beef small. The one worker reconfirmed the order and bread. They had a line and were working on a few sandwiches at once. They have a combo of toppings like Mayo tomato oil lettuce oil and seasonings and you can order that combo as “The Toppings” I said I didn’t want tomato and I wanted everything else.  

I get to work with 15 minutes before I have to start and open my sandwich, it’s the wrong bread, there’s no mayo and oil... only lettuce and onion. Just a dry sandwich. I didn’t see them make it because the cashier rung me up while it was being made. Unfortunately I didn’t get a receipt either. So I called the store, talked to manager (sorry I know it’s a Karen move)and said the sandwich I ordered was completely different from what I got aside from right size and right meat. She said there’s nothing she can  do. 

I opened my bank account and disputed the charge. Seven dollars isn’t a lot but I felt like it was money wasted. Am I the asshole??"
"AITA for getting mad at my friends because they don't invite me when they go out? | I'm the biggest introvert I know, but I do have some close friends. Our friendship is good most of the time (I'm the giver tbh, it's not like they ever do anything for me). The thing is that I really don't like going out because I'm an introvert, I just don't want to (plus I'm dealing with depression). However, I would like to be invited, even if I don't feel like going out with them, but they decided they just won't tell me anymore and go out without me. AITA?"
"AITA for giving my concert ticket to another girl after my friend said she only wanted to go with me as ""friends""? | I am 24M and I have a friend who is 21, she is really nice and we've known each other for a year. She is my sister's acquaintance and we met at my sister's birthday party. I have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. Lately I feel like I've been getting vibes that she likes me back.

Last week I won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. She also happens to like this singer so I asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. I said I can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. She said she'd love to go, but only as friends. She says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. She told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. I said I'll think about it. I was quite hurt because honestly I don't have much experience with rejection, and I was annoyed that she turned me down. 

Today, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. She immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. Still, I'm taking her out for drinks on Friday. But just now, the friend who I asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. I told her honestly that I already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.

When I told my sister about what happened, she said I'm being really douchy. She says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and I should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. I said she can't understand because she's not a dude. Because let's me honest, if I had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my ""friend"" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously I'm taking the second one. AITA for just being honest about what I want?

**EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed...

But the part where she says she’s not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. She likely said she’ll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. So why would I make the experience awkward for the both of us when I could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **EDIT OVER**"
"AITA for telling my ex's friend about how and why we broke up four years ago when it came up in the conversation? | Throwaway account, ESL, European (F23).

A bit of a backstory. I was a shy, nerdy girl in HS. At 17, I started going to LARPs, my confidence grew, got my first bf, mutually broke up with him, was single for a while, at 19 hit it off with another guy, got a second bf.

Leo was my age, liked a lot of the same stuff, was fun to be around. We weren't serious yet, just a lot of texting and some fooling around during events. Even the majority of our LARP friends didn't know yet. About a month in, he just stopped texting/calling me while we were apart. I didn't want to be ""the clingy gf"" and we were to see each other in cca a week so I thought I'd wait.

Then I found out that Leo met another girl (Tina) during a LARP and was a goner for her. It spread through the grapevine quickly (our country LARP community is small enough that everyone knows at least a friend of someone else).

I was hurt, not because I was in love but because of how I found out. I thought I deserved at least a text with an explanation instead of the avoidance he had done. Anyway, Tina had a bf so she turned Leo down, then I ended things, too, though I had to literally track him down during our next LARP to clear air between us. I had one binge night of sad songs, chocolate and wine and then moved on.

I started uni, met up with LARP friends living in the city and met Tina. Yes, that Tina. We clicked, started to hang out and four years later we are best friends. Very tactile and affectionate best friends who hug and kiss (on cheeks) frequently. Leo and how I was the one who ""got"" Tina in the end is a well-known story in our friend circle and we often laugh about it.

Last weekend, Tina and I attended a small, sci-fi focused con. They had a WH 40k section so I browsed some stalls, flirted with some guys, really hit it off with one. So as we stand there chatting, someone suddenly goes ""Kay?"" and there Leo is. Turns out he ran the stall with his friend with whom I was flirting. At this point, Leo is an amusing anecdote from when I was a teen so I do the whole friendly ""Haven't seen you so long, how are you doing etc"" and get ready to go back to flirting. The friend asks how we know each other, I go ""Oh, we used to date until he dumped me over a girl who didn't want him"", the friend goes ""Really? His loss."" and flirts more. Leo seems to be getting pissed and that's when Tina comes in, we hug, she kisses my cheek, tells me she's going to order our food and if I have any requests, I say just the usual, she leaves. The friend asks if she was my gf, I say no, she's my best friend and ""actually the girl Leo dumped me over"". At this point, Leo stomps off in a huff. The friend seems embarrassed over this but I shrug it off but the mood was spoiled so I sort of went to other sections. Leo later sent me a message on FB about how I embarrassed him in front of his friend by being so flippant and flaunting it all.

Am I the asshole for being open about reasons for our break-up in front of his friend?"
"AITA for not paying the tow fee for my guest's car? | My friend came over and he parked in a spot that he assumed was guest parking, but my apartment complex does not offer guest parking and there's signs all around warning people not to park without a permit. I assumed he would know not to park inside by reading the signs. He said he didn't see any signs so he got towed. He thinks it's my fault I never offered explaining the parking situation so I should pay for the tow. But I think its common sense to read signs and it's his responsibility to ask if he was unsure where to park. Who's responsible for the towing fee?"
"AITA for saying 'hail satan' to people in the street shouting off about jesus? | I just find it really funny, they get so upset and annoyed over two little words, like it's worse to them than telling them to fuck off.

I'm not a satanist, or a devil worshiper, or anything, but if you're going to throw religion in my face and annoy everyone trying to go about their day by shouting about jesus in the middle of the street, you deserve it. They should be respectful of everyone else's religions and viewpoints and not try to force theirs on everyone."
"AITA for not wanting to go to Eiffel Tower with my boyfriend | Final update:Hi, we just came back to hotel, I haven’t looked through replies but I noticed few people wanted an update. I even messed up days in og post,I was so nervous.He said we’d go on Sunday, I thought Sunday was tomorrow. We went today.

So, when I posted the story I was expecting 20 comments maximum. I also made a throwaway because my now fiancé uses Reddit. The post ended up on front page of the sub and he saw it. He decided to mess with me of course. 

We went to restaurant. It wasn’t as high as I expected, we had fun. He acted completely normal. When we were leaving I thought that he just wanted to have romantic dinner and nothing else. I wasn’t extremely upset, but I was kinda bummed out. 

He insisted on going for a walk. We walked in streets for little bit. He said he’d take picture of me, and kneeled down “to get better angle” and just pulled out a ring. I froze, he just started laughing, unfortunately I love him so I said yes, then I hugged him and made both of us fall while people were watching us. So..it went great!

***

Me(21M) and my boyfriend(25M) of 3 years are in France for 2 weeks.  

Yesterday he told me he had reserved table at restaurant on Eiffel tower. I don’t really want to go. I’m scared of heights, I don’t have phobia or anything but I just don’t like it. I told him that I didn’t want to go and he got really upset. I also told him that he could go alone if he wanted. I have no idea why he freaked out so much. He said he wasn’t mad at me but he was really upset. He’s still kinda quiet now and isn’t talking to me normally.

Update: I’m a dumbass, I didn’t even think about him possibly proposing. I said sorry and we’re going in 2 days. Thanks for judgement :)"
"AITA for discussing periods/female bodily functions with my friends in front of my brother? | My brother agreed to let me have the living room to myself today after I gave him a week notice that I was gonna have a mini party cause I'm a senior in HS and want to have a last get together before we all graduate.  Apparently there was a bunch of football games on today and around 9ish I asked my brother if I can have the living room around 3-7ish and he told me off saying how football is more important than my friends.  I think thats absurd cause he can just go watch his stupid sports in his room or just record the game for later while I have friends coming over that can't be rescheduled till much later.  

He was adamant that he wasn't gonna leave so me and the 5 friends that did show up (all girls) decided a good way to get him to watch it somewhere else was to sit right next to him and talk very loudly and in detail about our period and how our female bodies work.  My brother hanged in longer than I expected but the second I started talking about all that he got up and left.  I watched tv and had my little get together with my friends.  

I think what I did was funny but I do feel a bit bad about it but he had other options to watch the games and I couldn't reschedule my get together with my friends 

AITA?"
"AITA for putting in a bad word at work for an ex girlfriend? | Title is pretty self explanatory. I have a job that's somewhat desirable. We go through bodies like candy because management doesn't want to hire pot smokers. Sounds really fucking dumb to me but I don't get paid to think.

Ex messaged me on facebook asking to throw her a bone. So I told my manager she can't really be trusted. 

She cheated on me when we were about 18 and I broke it off. For what it's worth, I genuinely don't trust her enough to have her work here, if it were my choice. I might have acted a bit out of spite but if I had been asked I wouldn't be able to recommend her for fear of my reputation getting ruined when she pulls some bullshit."
"WIBTA if I complained to the air stewardesses about the obese man who was uncontrollably taking part of my plane seat? | Title says tldr but : 

I was in a cheap economy class flight and I was in the middle, and said man was in the isle seat next to me. 


I don't know how much he weighed but roughly 100-110KG, and compared to me 85kg his ass took up about 5% of my seat,  to the point where it was uncomfortable for me to sit there. 

I sucked it up throughout the flight but I think it's unfair that I paid for my seat and a guy was taking a portion of it, making my flight even less comfortable.  

WIBTA if I complained about this?"
"AITA for telling a kid the truth about the military? | I'm an assistant teacher at my current school so I can get my teaching certification. The school has a few kids from America (currently in Canada) who  are going to school here instead of America because their family landed a job in Canada for a while, military, etc. Well, a few days ago I was talking to one of these kids and he said when he graduates this year he's going into the military. I asked him why he was doing that and he said that he wants an easier time paying for college and the free medical insurance. Now, I've never been in the military, but I've dated a few soldiers and also have a few family members in the military, so I know some details. He was absolutely GLEAMING when he talked about the medical insurance, because he said he'll never have to worry about anything anymore. I told him that that's only partially true, and that the bill (in America) does work, but not as well as he may think, and that the VA will absolutely cut corners to save money. I told him that it's still a great idea for an easier time with college, but don't focus on the free insurance too much if that's his main reason for joining. He was upset by this but didn't say much else. 

This morning I got called down to the office and the kid's dad was there with the principal, apparently the kid has a conversation with his dad about this and the dad was FUMING, saying I was ruining his kid's dream of being in the military. AITA for being blunt about it?

**Edit: I forgot to mention I am from the US and came to Canada for college.**"
"AITA for getting angry at my girlfriend because her dog is overprotective? | My gf has a 5 year old german shepherd. He’s a great dog and can be friendly, but anything he even slightly determines to be a threat towards her and he becomes very aggressive. Even when we have a light argument he will perceive me as a threat and bark and growl at me aggressively. Not even yelling loudly but just having raised voices.  I feel ganged up on and feel like I can’t ever have a disagreement for fear of her dog retaliating. It’s like he can sense even slightly tense body language and immediately tries to neutralize the threat. 

Sometimes when I try to walk towards her or near her(for any reason) he gets in my way and blocks my path. If he’s lying on the couch and she walks away into the room, and I go into the room after her he’ll immediately jump off the couch and bolt in front of me and get to her first. I assume this is because he doesn’t trust me.

At first it was amusing but now it’s annoying and downright threatening at times. I finally decided to call her out on it when we we went out and she got very defensive. Claims that I’m just jealous that her dog loves her and that if I would stop “being an asshole” then he wouldn’t act that way towards me."
"AITA for buying my sons houses but not my stepdaughter? | I'm 48M, girlfriend is 44F, her daughter is 21F, my sons are 23M and 25M but they're mostly irrelevant to this post. I've been dating girlfriend for six years.

Years ago I bought both of my sons homes. I told them both the same budget, go find a house you like and let me see it, and I'll buy it for you. It was college graduation gifts sort of. I promised the same to my stepdaughter: graduate college, get a home wherever you want with a $200,000 budget. I firmly believe you can't get far in life with the current apartment rental rates, so this takes a major load off of shoulders.

Well, she graduated this past April and my girlfriend is bugging me to get the ball into motion on getting her a house. The thing is that when I made that promise years ago, I assumed we'd be married by now. I want to get married, but she doesn't want to. I told her I don't feel comfortable buying a house for someone ""not officially in the family"" if that makes sense.

Now the promise is if we get married, she can have a house, but I did make a compromise I could buy her a house but it remains in my name. My fear is I buy a house for someone, my girlfriend and I don't work out and split, then I've basically bought a house for a stranger.

Am I being an asshole here? If it makes a difference, my girlfriend is a SAHM, stepdaughter lives with us. Stepdaughter works in a hospital right now but it's relatively far (city over, 40\~min drive). I'm retired but have large savings, so I'm the only one with the money to make it happen."
"AITA for hiring someone for a commission that my husband hates. | My husband and his childhood best friend had a major falling out two years ago, and haven't spoken since. His ex friends wife is a very good professional artist, and does commission's regularly. I love her style so I sent her a request for a commission for a funny cartoon for my brother's birthday. I really thought it was no big deal. Apperently his ex friend called him saying that I was trying to ""snake back into his life"" by paying his wife to do this commission for me.  My husband is just upset he didn't know - he isn't upset I spent the money but he said he would have told me his ex friend would have freaked out (I was fully unaware this guy had a serious mental illness and has been known to go ape shit like this over little things)  and now  it's like a bunch of old dirt has been dug back up. His friend has been BLOWING up my social media account saying I'm an asshole for making him have to have contact with us again even though I never contacted him and all of our communication has been through her etsy. My husband is upset because said guy has gone back to the fight that ended their friendship and just wishes I would have used a different artist so he never had to hear from him (my husband and I have both now blocked him so he can't contact us)  I really just wanted the cute cartoon (which I got and it's adorable) and I really believe in helping local artists make money so I didn't want to contact a stranger. I didn't intend for any of this to blow up into all this drama.  
So Reddit, AITA? 
TLDR; My Husband's mentally ill ex friends wife drew me a cartoon on commission and is now having a total breakdown about it."
"AITA for cancelling on 60 people? | For some context, I am a teenager that just finished school and will soon be going to university.

My parents are currently on holiday and me and my friend (who we will call Mark) decided that, despite my parents' wishes, we were going to invite around 60 people to a party at mine to celebrate the end of school. I thought my house would be a mess by the end of it, but that no serious damage would be done. 

The day before the party was supposed to take place I invited Mark over to plan the party, as well as try out a new bong that I had bought in preparation.  An hour before Mark arrived he asked if one of his friends could come as well. I said yes. Mark, his friend and I sat around my house smoking and laughing. Mark asked if it was okay if another of his friends came and I agreed.

About 10 minutes later Mark's friend and 6 other people, 2 of which I have almost never spoken to just walked in. As in they literally, just let themselves in because i hadn't thought to lock the door. I also hadn't given any of them my address and would have said no to most of them coming.

They weren't aggressive in any way but they started rifling through my drawers, smoking without asking and acting like the house was theirs. They asked if they could smoke outside and I flat out said no because my next door neighbours were all in there gardens and I knew that sitting outside smoking out of a bong wouldn't go down well. I went upstairs briefly and when I came back down half of them were outside and the other half were talking about how great the party was going to be and how fucked up my house was going to get (these were the people I barely knew and weren't even invited.)  I started to realise what the party would actually be like and told everyone to leave. Almost all of them could see that I was pissed, knew how disrespectful they had been and left straight away but one of them, I basically had to push out my house because he ""wanted to get a better hit"".

After this, I started to seriously reconsider the party. I felt it had gotten too big and there were too many people coming who I just could not trust to not break anything or let in people who I didn't want there. I waited until I had sobered up then I messaged everyone telling them it was off.

Since this has happened some people have been understanding while others have been desperately messaging me to have it anyway, as well as some subtle insults over Twitter. At this point, I couldn't believe how some people were acting and it became apparent that a few just wanted a 'Project X' style fiasco. Despite knowing that this was the case I couldn't help feeling like the villain for telling everyone it was off, and I am still devastated that my high school legacy will be the guy that cancelled the gaff of the century 24hrs before it was supposed to start. I probably could have still had people over if I dramatically shortened the list but honestly my heart just was not in it anymore.

So AITA for acting in the way I did?"
"AITA for firing a guy who just found out he had cancer? | I was a supervisor for some years at a local manufacturing plant with a strict policy on attendance. This happened within days of me getting my promotion.

I took over a department that had been without supervision for a while and as such was in pretty bad shape. The employees were basically running wild because they had been able to do whatever they wanted for the better half of a year, including missing as many days as they wanted with no repercussions. This is what I walked into. I immediately started doing warnings for attendance and other issues to try and get the department in line. One employee (I'll call him K) I wrote up when I first started had missed several more days than were allowed according to policy, and the only reason I didn't fire K was because no one had written him up about his excessive absences. In my write up, I explained that if K was late, or missed any more days his employment would be terminated. Two days later, K came in 2 hours late. I brought him to HR and terminated his employment as I had promised. As I was walking K out he told me that it was pretty messed up that I had fired him the day he found out he had cancer, that i had basically killed him by taking away the health insurance needed to fight it. I had some discretion to cut him some slack, but didn't, even though I felt bad. So, AITA?

Edit: I found out about his cancer diagnosis after terminating him, while escorting him off the premises"
"AITA for displaying discomfort with a woman that brings her infant to class? | Long story short, today in class this woman brought her child, who kept crying and making noises during the lecture. She had to get up repeatedly to take him out the class, and it kept breaking my ability to focus on the teacher. She would look at me, laugh it off and say sorry, as I told her that she should consider putting the little guy in daycare. She scoffed and said that she can take her child where she can; and acted like I was the one being obtrusive. When the kid started screaming I told her to ""shut her baby up"", where three other girls found my comment offensive. The teacher didn't mind me saying it. The kid then kept pulling my pants and so I pulled my leg away and caused it fall (on accident), which I don't think is my fault. She placed her phone on the desk to record the video and then stood behind me as she tried to hush her baby. Her friends kept scoffing at me when I ignored her crying kid. I just wanted to attend class.

"WIBTA if I asked my new potential roommate how much her disability pay was? | I (19f)  been trying to find a roommate to in with in November. I’ve met this really nice chick (20f) and we’ve been just chatting and laying out what we would want. 

I’ve let her know I work full time, she said she doesn’t currently work but is on disability pay from the government. I know that’s a fixed monthly income and that it doesn’t always pay the most. My concern is that she doesn’t get that much and that a lot of the shared supplies around the apartment may end up falling on me since she wouldn’t have much left after she pays her bills. 

Would I be the asshole if I asked roughly how much money she got monthly?"
"AITA for buying a cake when my wife is trying to lose weight | So my wife has decided she absolutely must lose weight this year. Don’t ask me why, she’s not overweight at all, she’s 5’4” (162 cm) and weighs I would guess 120 or 130 pounds (54-58 kilograms).

Anyway she stopped buying any sweets at all when she goes shopping. I’m not overweight either, and I don’t really want to change my eating habits. So when I went to the store I bought a cake for dessert over the next week or so. 

She got upset and said that I’m trying to undermine her weight loss by tempting her into eating cake. Like, no, I want cake. If she wants to lose weight she can just not eat the cake right?

Anyway a friend said that I should support her by not getting sweets, but another friend said that she’s being ridiculous. So AITA?

Edit: this subreddit is about as helpful as my two friends lol. Basically an even split"
"AITA for bringing my own food to my friends house? | About a week ago, I got invited to a friend's house, let's call her Emily. Emily and I aren't that close, I've just joined her school, so I don't really know her or her family that well. Emily invited me to her house, and I was pretty excited as I don't get invited to people's houses often. I'm 14 and Emily is 15. When I arrived at her house, everything seemed to be running smoothly until it was time to eat. I've always been told to eat everything on my plate if I'm at a friend's house, but I'm autistic and there are some things I can't stand because of my sensory issues. To avoid the problem of eating things, I packed myself something I knew I could eat in my bag. When we sat at the table, I took out my food and started eating. Emily got pretty angry with me, and her mom also got mad. They both know that I'm autistic. For the rest of the time I was at their house I felt uncomfortable and out of place. When I got to school, she'd told my friends and they agreed that I was a little rude. I don't think I was that rude, but I might have been."
"AITA for freaking out to my boyfriend of 7 years that if he died, I wouldn't know legally if I'd lose everything too. He got upset and I didn't let it go. | I (25f) freaked out to my boyfriend (25m) about a hypothetical situation that I wouldn't know where I stood if he just suddenly died. We've been living together for around 5 years. I'm a student and he gets half of my student loan, which doesn't cover much but it's a situation we're happy with while I study. 

The house is in his name, and I was freaking out about if his parents could show up and kick me out and take all our stuff if the worst does happen. He got a little upset that I was implying his parents would do something like that. I tried to clarify that it wasn't that I thought that's the kind of people they were. I explained that it was more a freak out that although we live like we're married,  I'm legally a nothing and because of that in the midst of the worst thing I can imagine happening to me, I'd lose my home too and I don't know if I could do anything about it, or if it even worked that way. I was saying to him if the worst happens, I'd be on my own with nothing, with bills in my name and his folks squabbling over what's mine and what's his and I wouldn't know if I even had any rights. Also that I need to graduate fast and get my own stash because fuck that situation.

He still didn't really get it and told me to drop it because I was just upsetting him. I obviously didn't drop it at all because he wasn't getting me and I was trying to clarify that I wasn't upset about not having stuff if he died, or insinuating his parents are assholes. I was upset that I have no idea what would happen and if the worst does happen, I wouldn't be prepared. Also if his parents do decide to be assholes, I'd be really screwed because I haven't got my shit together yet. It ended with him saying I'd probably have to get rid of our dog, sleep on my dad's couch and go on benefits. I know it was a morbid topic and I was being a nutcase, but I thought his response was immature. 

AITA for pushing it when he asked me to stop? I thought I was being pragmatic (following a dumb ass freak out about a rhetorical situation), but I guess it was a little cold-hearted. What do you guys think?"
"AITA for asking my sister to watch my kid while I went to class and being pissed when she said no? | (REPOSTING THIS BC FUCKED UP TITLE LAST TIME, DO STILL ACCEPT ALL JUDGEMENTS FROM ORIGINAL!)

Obligatory disclaimers; have been Reddit lurker for long time, saw videos about this sub on YouTube, finally made account to post this. On mobile, so shitty formatting is shitty.

I'm a young single dad (22 with a 5 y/o). Kiddo's mum is, to put it kindly, a deadbeat drug addict who flip-flops between actually attempting to be a decent mother and having absolutely zero contact with our daughter at all. I have full custody and mum gets supervised visits when she can be bothered to show up but aside from that sees very little of our girl. I'm also a uni student and I'm pretty fucking proud of myself for managing to buckle down and do so well in my degree while raising a kid at the same time. I'm blessed that my university provides free childcare for students with kids and that I have an absolutely wonderful upstairs neighbour who is generally super reliable as a babysitter if I need to be anywhere in the evening.

My sister identifies as ""childfree"", which is whatever. She doesn't want kids, that's her choice. She's always been quite standoffish with my daughter and doesn't particularly enjoy spending time around her alone, however she's promised me before that she'll take over in an emergency. A couple weeks ago, I had a night class that is compulsory attendance on my course. My neighbour ended up not being able to look after my kid for this as she had a fall and had to go to hospital (she's much better now if you're worried!). I was stuck for a babysitter last minute, believed this constituted an emergency and asked my sister if she'd watch my kid for an hour or so while I attended the class (class is \~45minutes and it takes me \~10minutes each way to get too and from uni.) She flat out refused saying I ""knew how she felt about kids"" and that I should've been more responsible in finding a backup babysitter. I rang a couple friends but nobody could take my kid on such short notice, and she was sick with a pretty bad head cold at this point so I didn't want to take her to class with me. Ultimately, I ended up having to miss my class. I won't fail because of this or anything, but I will lose attendance marks and it'll bring down my overall grade.

I'm pissed at my sister. Not like furious, but pretty annoyed. I get that my kid is my responsibility and as a parent I have to make sacrifices, but my sister was home and not doing anything at this point and my little girl was mostly sleeping the entire time I would've been at class anyway. I know she's not fond of kids, but I wouldn't have asked her if I thought it was a legit emergency. She thinks I'm a dick for being annoyed, I think she's a dick for not helping me out. AITA here?

ETA: wanted to add a couple of potentially salient points. Not trying to sway anybodies judgement here, I get that it's my bad for not having a back up plan, but these are just a couple of things I feel I should've included originally.

* there aren't any grandparents in the picture who could've helped. My parents are both dead and the maternal grandparents, of their own volition, have met kiddo a grand total of twice in her whole life, both times when she was a baby.
* I definitely should have sorted a plan B, even if it's finding a local teenager who does babysitting or something in case my neighbour can't help. Didn't bring it up in the post originally bc I'm not trying to have a pity party here or anything, but I don't have much of a support system at all. As I said, kids mum is a drug addict and so was I until I knocked her up. We both agreed to get clean when we found out she was pregnant. I stayed clean after kiddo was born, she hopped straight off the wagon the second she was out of hospital and has no desire to get back on it. All that to say, I burned a lot of bridges and my support system is shitty at best so I struggle to find people to help out with stuff. As I said, not saying that for pity points or to sway anyone's judgement, just clarifying *why* I don't have a Plan B (will definitely take steps to make one in future).

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: I've commented this to a few people now, so I feel I should add it here as I guess it provides some further context to this situation that I skipped bc character count: my sister has *never* liked children. Like never. She's 10 years older than me and didn't play with me at all and barely spoke to me when we were kids until I was like 7 or 8 because she didn't like little kids. She also told me the first time she met my daughter, a few days after she was born, that she wants to be as uninvolved with kids as far as possible. Basically meant that, unless there's an emergency, she won't babysit for me (as established here), she won't lend me money for anything towards my kid unless it's putting food on the table (to be clear I don't expect financial support, but there was a time when I was truly desperate and needed it and she helped me only with bills and feeding myself - was getting nappies and formula from food banks. I'm not complaining or trying to be ungrateful for the support she gave her, just giving an example), and I don't take anything emotional or mental health related to her if it's to do with parenting struggles, only if it's something outside of that. This was well established when kiddo was tiny, so I knew what I was getting into, but this is just to prove the steadfastness (is that a word?) of her child free-ness."
"META: What happens to assholes after receiving their judgement? | Hey assholes! I’m really curious about what happens after you get your asshole judgement. I know humble pies are hard to swallow and no one wants to hear that they’re the asshole. I assume most people would only post if they thought they had a good shot at NTA. 

So please tell us what happens to the situation you posted about after your judgement. Do you accept your judgement? Do you apologise/make amends? Do you regret your wording in the original posts and/or still think the judgement was unfair? And do you think being judged the asshole lead to a positive outcome in the end?

Huge thanks the assholes that have already updated their original posts! They are enjoyable to read! "
"AITA For having a shotgun elopement and not telling my close friend? | As the title states my boyfriend (well now husband) and I had a shotgun elopement at the county clerks office last week. I told no one except my brother, sister, and parents. He told his best friend who served as our witness.

We or more so, I, have been incredibly quiet about the pregnancy. I told my parents, brother and sister, and three close friends when we found out. We’ve kept the whole thing off of social media.  Husband is way more outgoing and social and thus has more friends and has told a lot of them about pregnancy and about our plans of getting married. 

The day after the elopement we sent out our baby shower invites. On my side it is family and the few close friends I told about the pregnancy from the beginning.  As our return address we put Mine&Husband Surname and then our address. 
My close friend texted me and told me she now needs space from me to process that I got married without telling her and that she “got the wind knocked out of her by finding out on an envelope.” I explained to her that we basically told no one and did not want to make a fuss about it because right now us getting married is more of a legality, insurance thing. Our main focus is our baby and the celebration around that. Husband and I are attending a wedding in two months of a friend of his and two months after that a friend of mine is also having a wedding so as to not take away the shine of those longer relationships/ engagements/ long planned weddings we just didn’t want to announce that we eloped. We also didn’t want to bombard everyone we knew with oh we’re pregnant, oh we’re moving in together, oh we got married all in rapid succession. Yes husband and I talked about all these things but the timeline was sped up due to pregnancy. 

I told my friend that she was one of the first and only people to know about my pregnancy which to husband and I is a much more important and bigger commitment. I told her because I love and trust her and wanted to include her in that life changing event. 

She has told me that me getting married is life changing to her and that I don’t need to explain myself to her, I’ve already made my decision and she needs time and space to process and sort all of this out. She acknowledges that it may come across as her being selfish but she thinks she’s just being real with me."
"AITA for smoking on my balcony | Edit 2: well, fuck. whether or not I am an asshole, it seems i need to just stop smoking, period - on the balcony is the first step.

So, I live in an apartment complex that has banned smoking in the apartments but allows smoking on the balconies and in common areas. I'm not a heavy smoker but I do enjoy it and probably smoke like 5-10 cigarettes a day depending.

My *direct* neighbours on all sides are not smokers and have the habit of leaving all their windows open (all day and night). I am NOT the only smoker on my side of the building (there are like 5), but I know my habit is gross and I don't enjoy the idea of sending unwanted smoke into people's windows. I live on the fourth floor, so walking downstairs every time I want a smoke seems like an unfair burden just to be 'polite'.

I have the *right* to do so, but it still feels like an asshole move. My question: am I the asshole for smoking directly below a neighbour's open window? Part of me feels gross for doing it, but part of me also figures that ""that's life"" and if they don't like it they can just close their windows or pass a policy banning smoking in the common areas.

edit: thank you to the people concerned with my health. I've quit before and intend to again, but as anyone with a nicotine addiction could tell you: relapses happen."
"AITA if I ask my boys to put the toilet seat down? | Lately when I go to use our guest bathroom the toilet seat is always up. I told our boys that if they can’t put the seat down then they need to use their upstairs bathroom only. 

My husband and I have our own bathroom in which he always leaves the seat up and I could care less bc it’s our private bathroom. I am trying to teach our sons basic manners . For example, if they went to a women’s apartment for the first time and used her restroom I would hope they would put the seat down. My husband says I was stretching for using this as an example to try and teach manners. 

Well my husband went off on me bc he says the woman is being lazy for not just putting the seat down. Women can just as easily put the seat down as the man that lifted it. 

Thoughts????? Am I the asshole here?"
"AITA for supposedly humiliating my boyfriend in front of a waiter? | This happened before everything shut down, but it has recently came up again and I wanted to get an outsider's perspective.

I (23f) have been ""dating"" Eric (31m) for around 8 months now and this happened 1.5 months ago. I say dating in quotes because he never wanted to put labels on anything after coming out of another relationship, which I completely understand, I've done the same in the past. I came up to him because I felt him getting distant all of a sudden, and he said I shouldn't worry and added ""I don't worry about you like that, since we aren't even in a formal relationship"", which hurt me, but he said he would make it up by taking me on a ""real date"" after a while without one.

He wanted it to be a surprise, but it moderately fancy, modern restaurant. There was only an issue: it was an Asian seafood restaurant and I have a very minor allergy to fish and, while I won't die from eating it, oceany smells leave me queasy, so I don't like seafood in general. He knew that since I've mentioned it plenty of times, but he said ""your allergy isn't super strong, right? they might have something without fish in the menu, too""

Turns out they didn't have anything seafood-free outside of desserts. When the waiter came, I asked him if they had anything without seafood, to which he replied with a confused look, so I added ""yeah, I'm sorry, this is weird, but I have a mild allergy to seafood and my boyfriend brought me here anyway"". I could see the waiter stiffling a chuckle before saying he would try to get me something to eat. He ended up bringing me what seemed like an amalgamation of accoutrements from other dishes, roasted yams covered in crispy shallots with a bit of spicy relish on top, it was really good.

We finished eating, I gave the waiter a big tip from my own pocket, said I was immensely grateful for rescuing my night and asked him to thank the chef, too. We went back to the car and Eric blew up at me, saying I had humiliated him in front of the waiter and probably the entire kitchen staff, too. He also didn't appreciate being called ""boyfriend"". I mentioned he could just have remembered about my allergy, to which he said that he couldn't possibly remember every single tiny detail about me and that I shouldn't complain since he was trying to be nice.

Fast forward to now, I'm living in his apartment (rent free, his parents own it) and I said he shouldn't have been rude to our UberEats driver because he took a wrong turn and got here late, so he blew up at me again asking if I ""wanted to humiliate him in front of another service worker again like that night in the restaraunt"". He mentioned that event in a group chat we're in with a few of his friends and they mentioned I could have worded things better to not throw him under the bus.

So, AITA for calling him out in front of the waiter? I'm not used to fancy restaurants so I dunno about their etiquette."
"AITA for changing the Netflix accounts? | Let me start by saying my husband and I provide the Netflix account for several families. We dont mind doing this because my husband's aunt shares their hulu account with us. 

Each account on the Netflix is supposed to be for each family's use, plus the kids account--all 5 slots are in use. A while back, we had an empty slot because a family member decided to pursue their own account so they could do what we do now (we provide netflix, you provide hulu sort of a deal). During that time, my husbands 14yr old cousin decided she was going to set up an account on the account, which wasn't a big deal because there was no others at that time but she did not ask to do this.

Fast forward to about a month ago when my parents asked if they could use the account for when the grandchildren come over ""of course!!!"". So I deleted his cousins account to make room for them. NBD right? 

Apparently wrong, because the next morning I wake up to angry text messages from the 14yr old AND her mother. The 14yr old is scolding me about how she lost all of her shows and that she lost all respect for me. Her mom is scolding me for deleting her account with no warning, and that it was shitty to do since she asked to have it in the first place. She called me immature (both of them), which I have no idea where that came from since there was nothing that would have proceeded this being seen as retribution or something against her. 

That wouldnt have been so bad, but THEN (oh yes, there is a then) his cousin makes it a point to sit in the stairwell with her phone on speaker so I can hear her mom reiterate this point AND offers to buy her a Netflix or Disney+ account ""Whatever you want"". 

I could go on and on about this untitled brat, but what I wanna know is this:

AITA for deleting her unauthorised account to make room for my parents?"
"WIBTA if I spent more money on a vacation w/my siblings now that I know how much money they make | My siblings & I always vacation together.  We get along great & have kids that are the same age.  Most are upper middle class except one who we thought was solidly middle class.  Bc of this we always book low cost vacation homes, mostly in “off” location (just outside the place we are visiting), w/minimal amenities to keep costs down.  Well I just found out the one we thought was “middle class” makes more than all of us (not a ton but more).  I gave him the WTF look when I found out & he just laughed & said “What?! I like to live below my means.”  So I’m in charge of booking our next vacation home & I’m not interested in a luxury 5 star resort but also not interested in staying at an “off” location anymore bc it’s a real pain to deal w/carting all the kids stuff around for the day.  It would be much more convenient to stay someplace we can run back to for an hr or 2 during the day to change clothes, eat or let the kids rest.  But, of course, more convenient locations cost more money.  WIBTA if I just booked the more convenient location now that I know we can all afford it even though the 1 doesn’t WANT to pay that much.

EDIT:  Info - I just send links to the places I’ve narrowed it down to & wait for feedback.  I just wouldn’t include links to places that are less convenient/less money.  Then I pay for it & they reimburse me their portion.  (he picks the cheapest regardless) 

Look we grew up together, I get it & I’m not into spending a ton either but I honestly thought he was BTcheapA by making us cart all the kids stuff around when we all could just spend a bit more for convenience.  So I guess we cater to him again ...

EDIT 2:  I did not chose to be the one to book this vacation. They decided I should do the research etc & I agreed to.  Also, at this point there is NO SET budget.  I’m just getting an idea of how much different areas cost before passing options along."
"AITA for not filling up a borrowed vehicle? | Background info: my parents are both employed, and although nearing retirement are earning great money. My wife and I are also both wage earners and are generally fine; we are coming off a month of mortgage and rent so things are a tiny bit tight right now. That said, one tank of gas won't put us on the dole. 

I borrowed my parents' pickup to finish a move from the house we are selling. I had used it a couple weeks ago. A couple weeks ago, I borrowed it around 1/4 tank. During the move, I filled it all the way up and returned it with the needle between 1/2 and 3/4 tank. 

This time, when I borrowed the truck, the gauge read empty. The light came on ~20 miles into my usage. The other day, my mom made a comment that I should ""make sure to fill the truck up"" before I return it. I pointed out that it was on empty when I got it, and I'd already filled it once. She said it shouldn't matter. I said if it were my truck, I'd be happy enough getting it back with half a tank. She said ""I guess times have changed!""

I am grateful for the use of their vehicle, and this isn't a hill to die on, but I'm just curious to know what Reddit thinks. If I return the truck as it is now (~3/4 tank), WIBTA?"
"AITA for letting a guy quit while I was firing him so I wouldn’t have to pay severance? | I’m a small business owner and I had to let one of my employees go today. 

I called him in and began to explain that he was being let go and why, and he stops me and goes on a bit of tirade, you know, “I’m the one who makes this place run. I’m the last guy who should be getting fired.” And I was sitting, letting him get it out of his system. Then he says: 

“And what’s more, you can’t fire me. You can’t fire someone who doesn’t work here. *I*. *QUIT*.” So I seized the moment and said “You’re quitting?” 

And this is the PG version but basically he said  “You’re damn right I am!” And I said “So you’re resigning your post, you are choosing to not work here anymore, you are leaving your job?” 

He said yes, he said a few other things, he left. I processed his removal as though he’d quit. I no longer had to pay him severance of any kind. 

Now I feel a bit badly. Because I know getting fired is tough and you sometimes react off the cuff, I’ve been there. 

But he did go on a loud, insulting, profanity laced tirade making statements against me and his coworkers and our clients, and most importantly, he really he did quit. 

Am I the asshole for letting him quit instead of giving him the benefits he would have been entitled to if he were fired?"
"WIBTA for not loaning my friend $2,000 and causing him to get evicted? | Guy in question is a very close friend, was a groomsman in my wedding last year and everything. He’s been having some extremely bad luck recently. Last week, he caught his partner of six years having an affair, and they ended their relationship. His partner has since moved out, leaving him to pay the rent in their shared apartment by himself, and as if he weren’t already dealing with a shitty enough hand, his car just broke down and the mechanic quoted him roughly $2,000 to get it fixed (blown head gasket and some other issues). 

He called me freaking out about an hour ago, explaining that he can’t afford to pay for both the repairs and the increased rent for the next three months, when his lease expires, and he’s going to have to choose between losing transportation to his job or being evicted. He asked if it would be possible for me to loan him $2,000, to be paid back in $200 monthly installments through the end of the year.  

I could comfortably afford to loan him this amount based on my current savings and salary. However, I’m hesitant to front him the money because, well, it is a significant amount of cash. I loaned him smaller amounts a handful of times when we were in college, and he always paid me back, but it was never more than $50 or so … I worry that if for some reason he can’t/won’t pay me back, I’m going to really resent him and it’ll permanently damage our friendship. WIBTA?"
"AITA for leaving my cousin’s destination wedding early? | My cousins come from a wealthy family. They never understood why my family wasn’t as wealthy as them. They always assumed my parents hid money. For years her family would put my family in financially tough situations.

Where I come in is my cousin’s wedding. She announced a destination wedding. I’m married with a kid on a single income. We live ok but we don’t vacation because we can’t afford it. When she said her wedding is in Italy I knew we couldn’t go. It’s been my mom’s dream to go to but she couldn’t afford it either. I saved up a lot of credit card points so I offered to fly her out there.

Once my mom knew she could go she wanted my dad and little sister too. I had already bought their tickets with points when I told my cousin I couldn’t afford the trip and was sorry. Tickets would have cost $2000 each because of Labor Day weekend and the only way I could was flying out 3 days earlier and stay 3 days after the wedding. Total cost $1000 each. 

She replied “but I spent $500 to go to your wedding.” My wedding was local and near an airline hub. The venue had dozens of hotels and restaurants nearby and a short ride from the airport. Her wedding venue was a villa in the middle of Tuscany, 3 hours from Rome, no restaurants or hotels nearby. We were forced to stay on the villa property. 

Guilted now into going, we decided to make the best by visiting other European cities. My aunt asked my parents to take my 90 yr old grandma, ruining their tours and my plan to drive the 5 of us to the villa. That got squashed. Then we find out that she’s doing a 4 day wedding and I’m in the wedding party so I need to be there all 4 days. I had to make changes and lost money on rebooking and had to cut out a city.

At this point we were upset by the guilt trip, the enormous expense, asking us to babysit my grandma (who is in no physical shape to travel), itinerary changes, and that we needed to leave our child with my in-laws. We showed up at the villa late after a flight delay and one of the first questions we get asked “it must be tough leaving your kid behind?”

We’re at our limit so we go to our room. There’s no AC, it’s 83 F, windows are open but there’s mosquitos, and the mattress is 2” thick and hard as a rock. We didn’t sleep until 4am because of the welcome party and heat. When we get up at 7 breakfast is delivered. It’s 1 croissant each in a brown bag left at the front door. This is where I lost it. It dawned on me that they didn’t care about guests, especially those that don’t have money. We spent thousands to go to the wedding and they chose the location that was easy on them. They flew into a smaller nearby airport, had a personal driver. Money wasn’t an issue for them. 

At that point my wife and I knew we were only going to be miserable and I would explode so we left. We packed, said goodbye to my parents, drove back to Rome to continue our vacation. Am I the asshole?"
"AITA For asking my wife to leave the bedroom if shes going to be using her phone? | My wife likes to scroll through Facebook (for hours) when she goes to bed. Usually this isnt a problem because I typically go to bed an hour or so before her because I go to work very early in the morning so I'm asleep by the time she comes to bed. Occasionally she will come to bed at the same time and lay there looking at her phone. It pretty much lights up the room even at minimum brightness and makes it hard for me to get to sleep. Last night this was the case and after asking her to turn off her phone so I can sleep, she got all pissy about it so I told her ""If you want to be on your phone, please go downstairs, I am trying to sleep here"". She got up, grabbed her pillow, and walked out saying ""you know, this is bullshit, it's my bed too"" and slammed the door. She ended up sleeping on the couch. She texted me a few minutes later saying she just wanted to lay in bed, not be banished to the livingroom.

Edit: Some people are saying to try an eye mask. I have before and I dont like them. I have a hard time with things on my face."
"AITA For not paying for my daughters trip when I said I would? | In the past I have told each of my kids (3 in total) that I will pay for them to go overseas backpacking for a couple months after they graduate before they start working full time.

Oldest son went to Australia, had a blast. Middle child went to Asia, also had a blast.

My youngest daughter is about to graduate and wants to go back packing through South America and Mexico... by herself.

I’ve since reneged on my promise unless she picks somewhere safe. I don’t think she is safe backpacking alone through those counties as a young women by herself, and if anything happened to her I would 100% blame myself.

I’ve told her to choose a country In Europe/Asia/Oceania. She insists on Mexico and South America. Her mother (ex wife) called me up called me a controlling prick.

So here I am. AITA? I think I’m being pretty reasonable here."
"AITA for not wanting to be in the delivery room when my girlfriend gives birth? | I’ve been in a long term relationship for 7 years. My girlfriend doesn’t believe in marriage and has turned down the notion of me ever asking her, but for all intents and purposes we both plan on spending our lives with one another.

Gf is due to give birth in January 2020. I’m obviously over the moon excited, and can’t wait. First baby for both of us. 

Now, I’m sure I’m going to be laughed at on Reddit here, but I’m an incredibly squeamish guy. I believe this stems from when I was a kid, I threw up at camp and there was blood in it and some bullies rubbed my face in it holding me down in my own sick. 

Since then the smell or sight of blood makes me dead faint. I get sick, I get this weird numbness in my ass, I just for whatever reason can’t handle it. I literally pass out if I’m around blood. Many years of therapy later, I’ve just accepted blood is a no go for me. Even if I myself bleed, I have to look away from that shit straight away or I’ll end up throwing up. 

I’m ok handling it on tv etc but when I see it IRL I can smell it and taste it in my mouth and that’s where things get weird for me.  

So I explained to my gf that I’m with her for literally every step of the way but I don’t think I can be in the delivery room. Because she knows about the blood thing, I explained to her that that was my reasoning and that obviously I didn’t want to stress her out even more by throwing up or passing out, I especially don’t need medical attention on me during a time when all the attention needs to be on her. 

She became very defensive and said that I’m being an asshole for not even trying to enter the delivery room, and that I’m being selfish. I said that I know if I try and go in I’ll end up feeling unwell and that it’s better to just work around my limitations instead of me trying to be in there and then needing to be escorted out.

I spoke to my Gf’s mom because they’re best friends and she told me that I was basically not a man if I couldn’t handle going in there, so I’m feeling pretty upset and concerned over this because it’s not just me feeling light headed, it’s me actually blacking out 

~~AITA because I don’t want to compromise on this?~~

UPDATE: My girlfriend decided to read through these responses just out of curiosity. She’s changed her mind and told me it’s okay if I don’t want to be there, and also told me she loves me and we are completely cool. She also apologized on behalf of her mom since she wasn’t aware about her telling me to man up , which although was unnecessary was also completely appreciated. I’m the luckiest guy in the world and I’m v grateful that she changed her mind. I told her I’m gonna try and stick it through anyway but just knowing I have her blessing to wait outside is a great relief. Thanks for the ones who wished us well also. Y’all classy.

UPDATE II: some people are wondering how I plan on being a good parent if I pass out at blood. Others are demanding that I go to therapy. I’d like to point out that *I am still in therapy* for this issue (and have been for years) and my doctor feels that once I have my own child I will hopefully be able to deal with it without too much trouble. Apparently it’s exceedingly common and I’ve spoken to more than one qualified person who’ve told me a simplified version of ‘once your kid actually gets here it’s a different ballgame’. If anyone who has some knowledge of this wants to weigh in and explain better than me I’d be grateful. 

I’m getting a few pm’s that are becoming hostile so all I can tell ya is that I plan on being the best father possible and I’m gonna try my hardest *not to faint* if my kid ever skins a knee or gets a bleed."
"WIBTA: Vegetarian refusing to work on meat-related advertising account at work. |   

As the title says, I’m a vegetarian. And although I’m not one of those militant vegetarians, and on the whole very pragmatic about it, vegetarianism is something I do feel very strongly about.

**Current situation:**

My company works on an account for a meat-focused restaurant chain helping them to promote their stores. It’s been a client for a couple of years now and sits within my wider team. Despite there being several occasions in the past where I’ve been asked to become significantly involved in the account, the company has respected my decision when I’ve refused.

I’ve not completely avoided the account, occasionally helping out with mechanical tasks like proofing or offering up other resources for the team to use. I’ve been ok with this level of input because it has never involved much thought from my side. Essentially, it would happen the same with or without my input so I might as well help my team (who I’m on good terms with) and I don’t feel like I’m betraying my beliefs as a result. 

Anyway, due to some changes at work, I’m being asked again to take on more responsibility with the account. Initially I was asked to lead the overall account as day-to-day client contact  – something I was able to push back on and convince them was not a good idea. However, they are still asking me to play a core role behind the scenes, leading the strategy and execution. In contrast to the current situation, I would need to contribute thinking and actively use my skillset to help promote a cause which I believe to be inherently bad.

**WIBTA for refusing to take on this account?** Some more info below to help you see things from both sides:

**Why I might be an asshole:**

* · I have the capacity to take this on at the moment. It would also most likely end up with someone who doesn’t have much extra capacity to support if I refuse.
* · Other than me being a vegetarian, I’m probably the best person in the company to be working on this account, based on my skillset and other experience
* · I’ve worked on the account before, as mentioned above, so it may look like I’m just playing the vegetarian card as it suits me

**Why I don’t think I’m an asshole:**

* · This is a long-held belief of mine that’s well-known in the company. It should be obvious that a vegetarian shouldn’t work on this account, and when I have supported in the past, it’s been clear that it is only in a very basic capacity and has still been a considerable compromise on my part
* · The minute I start trying to think about ideas for the client, I feel this huge contradiction and can’t allow myself to think any further. In all honesty, I’d be happy if this restaurant chains goes out of business so it’s hard to think up strategies that are designed to do the exact opposite
* · Agreeing to contribute to something that goes against my beliefs is the definition of selling out. Even if my job was to be threatened (which it shouldn’t come to, but you never know), I should still stick to my beliefs. Otherwise, what’s the point in having them?"
"AITA for wanting my steak well done and wanting the same quality steak as my boyfriend. | Basically the title.


My boyfriend likes to cook. And one of those meals we have on occasion is steak.


I like my steak well done where he likes his more rare. I have asked him, time and time again, to make sure my steak doesn’t have a lot of pink. Nevertheless, I continue to receive bright pink steaks. Now this would be fine if he forgot once, but apparently it’s not a matter of forgetting. He thinks that steak that’s cooked well done doesn’t have the same flavor as one that’s raw. Sure, that’s probably true, but I like my steak well done and that’s why he’s refusing to cook it like that.

So what inspired this post was, as you can guess, a pink steak. Today was the day I found out why he wouldn’t cook it well done for me. And now he’s saying that he will refuse to buy me the same price steak as he’ll buy himself. He wants to buy a 20.00 steak for himself and a 10.00 one for me because apparently there’s no point to cooking an expensive steak well done.

He thinks that cause we don’t buy steak often it means that he’s NTA, meanwhile I disagree.


Edit: He has given me food poisoning from it before.

Final edit:
We’re both laughing at the replies here - some of you guys go crazy over your steaks! 

Just to clarify a couple things - I like medium rare steaks and well done, I just have some stomach issues (IBS) that is really hit or miss when it comes to food. Hence why I “prefer” them as cooked as possible.

Anyway, thanks for the input! He’s going to keep the quality of meat the same for me after this, even if I do get a couple of “you’re eating leather” jokes from him from now on. (Thanks for that haha)"
"AITA for expecting my girlfriend to share her Christmas Money. | So me and my gf have been together for a few years l and living together for 2.

I am notoriously hard to by for at Christmas, my hobbies need you have have an understanding to buy presents. Due to this i mainly get money/vouchers or house hold items and my family have started to put both names on the gift rather then just me.

Last year my mum gave us money for some tickets to a show i wanted to see but we were unable to go so ended up with cash about £200. I wanted to use most of it to buy a TV for our bedroom which she wasnt keen on i even said she could get somthing little aswell (like £20). She reinforced it was our money and it needed to be somthing we both wanted. I was a bit miffed as tickets were really a present for me and it was from my family. we ended up spending it on a day out and still have a bit left over which went into our holiday savings. 

This year her family mostly get her a big gifts and me a smaller gift which is fine, My Sister got us hundred pounds worth of resturant vouchers from which we will share. 

Her grandmother allways sends her a Christmas card with money in this year it was a addressed to both of us. When she opened the card she put the money in her purse.

 I challenged her on it saying its addressed to both of us we should share, she maintained that it was really for her and that the card was shared but the money was her gift. 

Im annoyed as it felt like money gifts from my family are shared and hers she keeps, it wasnt alot of money (£40) so i dropped it after while but explained id make sure my family split our gifts if shes goning to be like that.

Was i the asshole?"
"AITA for taking back a gift I gave to my child? | I got one my children a Nintendo switch, because her grades improved a lot over the last week. She loves it, and I have gotten her a couple games already, like Super Mario Oddysey and 1-2 Switch.

However, she recently confessed to me that she lied about her grades. I took away her switch and when she asked me why, I said that it was because of her lying and not confessing until later. I then said that I was having it for a couple weeks, and if she wanted it earlier her grades were going to improve. 

My ex-wife is mad and said that I should look into the cause of the bad grades instead of keeping the switch away from her. I retorted by saying that she must know nothing about parenting if she is the cause of me being a single mom now."
"AITA for refusing to work with a streamer despite working with all her friends? | Hello reddit, I'm gonna start saying that I'm a digital artist and I do commissions often because it helps me support myself through college (which is not art related). I've only been doing it seriously for maybe a year and a half, but I've taken commissions for up to 4 years.

Now, 2 years ago I was drawing quite differently and I'll be the first to admit it wasn't that good..I was trying to stand out in my art community so I was doing some questionable things with my 'style'. Here comes, miss streamer: I did a gift for one of her friends that I was(and still am) a fan of and she messaged me saying how much she loved it and how she'd want to commission me if possible. I was very flattered, but because I was trying to focus on studying at the time, I said I'd make it for free when I had a chance. She wasn't the only one i promised, and i ended up taking too many requests and i couldn't complete them all - later i made a public post saying i won't be finishing them and apologizing.

A couple of months after, she messaged me again wanting to know if I had commissions open, and this time I did! I gave her my prices, and after about 5 minutes she asks me if I could lower the icons (13$) as its 'too expensive for her and other artists -implies *better artists* - do it for cheaper'. Naturally, a little annoyed, I said no, that those are my prices and that I have no reason to give her a discount. I shit you not, this woman pulled a 'well, since you never did my request before, nor did you message me about it, I feel like its unprofessional of you not to lower a bit'. I told her in nice terms to go fuck herself and it sort of ended there for the time.

Now, I'm much more confident in my art nowadays and I'm lucky enough to get to pick my clients, but imagine my surprise when miss streamer comes flying in my message box. She was acting like any of our former conversation never happened (I know she knows who I am, she unfollowed me at the time and followed me back like a month after), and to be frank, I've been working with a lot of people in her community as I also have friends there. I refused her, what I thought was the obvious thing to do, I'm sure she could 'get better artists to do it for cheaper'. But uhh, I'm here because one of my good friends thinks that maybe she's changed and I SHOULD give her a chance. Personally, I dont really feel like it's my problem considering how disrespectful she's been to me before, but I'll ask you: aita?"
"AITA for getting annoyed by boyfriend's daughter getting into our bed in the middle of the night. | So I'm in a great relationship with my boyfriend and have also procured a pretty good relationship with his daughter, she is 11.  We live together in a committed relationship, share parental duties..This is not some fling and I'm not just a ""girlfriend"". I never wanted children but his pre-existing contion (joke, child from previous marriage) was not a deal breaker. Anyway, I have expressed the fact that this bothers me and I'm told by my boyfriend that it will pass and she'll grow out of it. He has joint custody so she is with us more than half the time. It completely frustrates me evertime I see her in the bed. I don't get it at all. Boundaries are already very limited with children, I get that, but no kids in the bed! I tried to rationalize that it's like my favorite kitty sleeping on the bed with us, but that only helped temporarily. I love this little gal so I don't understand why I get so pissed about it? I think it could be some good old primitive jealousy on my part. How do I get past it? But more importantly AITA for getting irritated?

Edit: added more information for clarity. Posts after a double shift at work are clearly tricky."
"AITA for thinking a cancer survivor is milking it? | With a title like that I have to be right?

A long time coworker of mine (I will refer to him as Mark) was diagnosed with stage two Hodgkin’s lymphoma. For context it is what I understand to be a very beatable form cancer. And by beatable I don’t mean into remission I mean gone. Cured.

Mark works with kids. He announced to the families that he had cancer and would not be working. Mark did not have short term disability. He had access to it but chose not to enroll. Mark did not qualify for government disability because as I understand it the treatment was not serious enough to merit the person not work.

A parent relocated to take care of Mark during treatment. A friend donated a house for them to live in rent free. His current landlord did not charge him rent during treatment either, under the impression he would need a place to live once his treatment was finished.

The families donated time and property to clean and furnish the house. The families then set up a meal system to provide dinner for Mark and his mom every night through treatment. The employer paid their Hulu subscription at the highest possible level. Coworkers donated their sick time.

The families created a go fund me to help with additional living expenses. His employer and coworkers sold sweatshirts and organized a fund raising event. Everything combined over $18,000 was raised.

The hospital covered the cost of treatment.

Mark went through six months of Chemotherapy, and after his twelfth treatment he was declared cancer free. Through all this he did not work but proceeded to snowboard, hike, and travel.

Mark decides not to move back into his old house and gives no advanced notice to his land lord or the other tenants. He plans to buy jet ski.

He clearly built a bank roll from peoples donations while everything was already being paid for. And is now deciding to buy a jet ski.

I think Mark is an asshole for keeping the excess money, and especially for even considering buying a jet ski, the pinnacle of luxury items. I know others that feel this way, but none of us feel we can openly talk about it since he survived cancer.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: For additional info a number of employees that donated either money or sick time are minimum wage, and if they’re not they majority still make less than he does and none have jet skis. 

Edit: For additional clarity on my stance, I think to say he’s milking it isn’t accurate. I just feel if you have excess money from donations in a situation like this you should either keep it and be low key about it or pay it forward and donate it. Buying a luxury item like this seems very inappropriate."
"WIBTA if I don't let my parents bring SOs to my wedding? |  Hi all, I (29F) have been engaged for almost a year now, but have not made wedding plans yet mostly due to a few reasons - 1 being that I don't want to waste money on a wedding, and 2 being that my parents are recently divorced and not on good terms. My mom had a boyfriend during her marriage to my dad and is still with him, and though I've tried to tolerate him, he's manipulative and insufferable. He's has said nasty stuff about his ex-wife and jokes about how my mom being married didn't stop him. My dad is off and on again with a very trashy woman only a few years older than me and every time I see her, she is completely shit faced and rude, and dresses like a cheap hoe at formal events.

So anyway, I recently found out I'm pregnant, almost 8 weeks today! My SO and I are very excited, but I would like to get married early enough to fit in the dress I already bought and not have to waddle down the aisle. I'd also like to get on my SO's health care ASAP. And of course, if we were worried about affording a wedding before, now I have to worry about paying for a freakin baby and buying a reliable baby friendly vehicle. While I would love to just run to the court house and sign the papers, my mom and my SO's family are hard against it. So a small simple backyard ceremony might be a good compromise. My parents are willing to help pay for a wedding which is great because it's more for them than for me. However, I feel I have to put my foot down and tell them they can't bring dates. I think my dad will probably be fine with it, but my mom will probably be a little upset. My mom lives with her bf and just attended bf's son's wedding so I'm sure she's expecting that I'll invite him to mine. (Bf was recently divorced when he contacted my mom and I doubt his kids know the details as far as him being a homewrecker, etc.)

Our wedding will be in my SO's state where we live, so it will be a lot of his friends and family meeting mine for the first time. I don't want to be the redneck family that has dad throwing punches at cheater mom's bf, the bf rubbing everyone the wrong way because he's obnoxious and overbearing, and drunk train wreck gf flashing her cooch in her tiny dress halfway through dinner. That's how I'm picturing it anyway, and I won't even be able to have a drink to help laugh it off! I'm not far along yet, but pregnancy has already made me short tempered and emotional, so I just want to limit the drama. WIBTA if I expect my parents to pay for my wedding, AND not bring their SOs? And I hate confrontation, but WIBTA if I didn't discuss this with them before I sent out their invitations?"
"AITA For not cleaning regularly around the house | I know how it sounds, but bear with me here.

I'm depressed, to the extent where getting up in the morning, showering, seeing friends or eating at meals time is just really hard. This hasn't been going on for very long, only a few weeks, and I've had a history of dipping in and out of really difficult periods for several weeks at a time every year or two. Publicly I put on a brave face and do my job, then come home and just wait for the next day to start. I would go to therapy, but right now it's just not a financial possibility. I'm really not here for advice on dealing with my mental state, I'm working on it the best wya I know how with the support of those around me, so I'd respect if people could keep their opinions on my health to a minimum unless it's part of their judgment. 

I'm in my own place but spend half the week with my family, and I have a long time boyfriend, Mark, who comes over to stay half the week with me and half with his family. We don't pay rent as its a family home I'm looking after. Since we spend equal time here (roughly) we do pay bills etc together.

Generally, we share the chores equally (the garden, trash, cooking, hoovering) but I'll do the deep cleaning and general tidying as Mark doesn't really notice or care that much once the place isn't a complete sty. So, lately I've been letting things slip a bit. I don't ask Mark to do anything extra, I either ignore it or just push it into a spare room or press, but I know that isn't necessarily fair. The house certainly isn't filthy, but it's not up to usual standard either. Sometimes when I feel down like this I'll have a manic clean and everything wi be spotless, but I'm not there just yet.

Mark contained that I'm not doing my share. He isn't wrong. I apologised and explained what's up (he knows about my past issues with my mental health) and just asked for some support and time. Again, the place certainly isn't that bad, but I wouldn't be inviting guests over either if you know what I mean. 

He said I'm being selfish about it, making him do an unfair amount of work. I said I haven't asked him to do anything extra, I'm just struggling with my responsibilities and if he wants he can just leave off his chores and take some time at his parents so he doesn't get bothered by the mess. Again, it's just untidy - certainly not unhygienic or filthy. I feel like I don't even create much mess in this state - I don't use the dishes, I have my own laundry basket, once I come home I basically don't move until bed. Not that that's much of an excuse - it's both our job to keep it tidy regardless of where the mess comes from. 

AITA for hoping for compassion? If I had a roommate feeling like this, I would think I'd be supportive. I know it's not his problem or his fault, but I can't really help it right now. I don't want to sound like it's a cop out,  but I know I just need time (a few weeks) to get myself back on track."
"AITA for wanting a shelf of the fridge all to myself? | 
Edited for clarity. It seems a lot of people are upvoting a comment that said my reaction was petty, and all my clarifying explanations were voted down. Very confusing. I didn’t do this after she said no. I didn’t “react” towards her in anyway. My comment about the butter was genuine, and in no way sarcastic or mean spirited. Sometimes I think people downvote without actually reading anything. 

I recently just started going to the gym because I am unhappy with my weight. I’m working with a personal trainer and doing a program that requires I do meal preparation from a specific cookbook. I now have to prepare seperate lunch and dinner from my wife, who refuses to eat what I’m cooking. This means that I buy my own individual groceries, while my wife orders from those companies that deliver fresh meals in individual bags that you cook yourself. These bags take up almost the entire fridge. I organised the messy fridge, and gave myself a single shelf in the process so that I could keep my groceries and meals in a single place. 
After I did this, I told my wife and asked her to leave that shelf for me. She got really pissed at me and called me selfish. She said she didn’t want to have to think about where she’s putting things in the fridge. 
This blew over with her agreeing it was okay, but today I saw a new tub of butter sitting on my shelf. I genuinely thanked my wife for buying it for me, as I had just mentioned I was out of butter the previous night. She acted surprised and said she just bought butter it wasn’t especially for me. I clarified my question by saying I was asking because it was on my shelf. There was nothing mean-spirited about this comment. Literally a clarification. She said she forgot. I said nothing to her. I do not particularly care about it being on that shelf. I felt disrespected because we had already had a big discussion about it, where she said agreed it was okay. People are assuming I don’t communicate with my wife. This is not the case. A lot of the comments are extremely irrelevant because they assume something untrue about my reaction or our relationship. That’s what I get for coming to Reddit I suppose haha."
"AITA for refusing to cook my boyfriends steak rare? | I’ve been with my boyfriend for a couple years and normally we get on wonderfully and there’s 0 clash of personality. 

One of the things that we don’t always see eye to eye on is food- I love to cook and experiment with food, and he is very much a meat and potatoes kinda guy. 

I recently ate a steak that was well done that tasted REALLY good. I know there’s going to be a lot of people turning their noses up and saying ‘impossible’ but honestly, it was delicious and I wanted to try and recreate it at home. 

I asked my boyfriend if he would be interested if I purchased some steaks and I specified it was an experiment to give the well done steak a try at home. He said he was on board. 

On the day of I prepped and was ready to go. At the last minute he decided he wanted it rare. I was super disappointed and irritated because I wouldn’t have ordinarily bought the steaks midweek, it was specially to give this a try- and I was excited because I thought he could try it and I had a feeling he’d enjoy it.

I said I was NOT preparing him a rare steak. I said if he wanted to cook his own steak rare that was fine but I had been excited to prepare this for him. I ended up cooking my own steak and he ended up making his own. He’s been telling everyone and anyone that I’m petty and should have just accepted that he changed his mind."
"AITA when I say I'm Jewish (but I'm not)? | So I work in retail, and since the holiday season is here, I usually says ""Happy Holidays!"" to the customers after I check them out. This has cause some ""nice"" old ladies to correct me and say ""Merry Christmas to you too!"" or just flat out say ""you're supposed to say Merry Christmas.""

The area that I live in is not very diverse when it comes to religion, so I see how they're used to the Merry Christmas, but I'm an atheist (who half celebrates Christmas) and I want to wish all people happy holidays.

Since I'm very petty, whenever a customer corrects me or says Merry Christmas back, I say ""oh sorry I'm Jewish."" This causes them to stop for a second, and sometimes they say ""Happy Hanukkah"" and other times they say ""oh Happy Holidays then!""

More recently I realized this may be a assholey thing to do, since I'm not Jewish and I probably shouldn't be saying I am just so that the customers say Happy Holidays... but I guess my reasoning is it makes them think about the fact that not everyone celebrates Christmas and Happy Holidays is more universal. But still I could just be an asshole.

So AITA?"
"AITA for not letting my friend stay at my place? | This has been eating away at me for a while. The story is kinda long and boring but I hope you can help me settle this.

I have this very, very close and old friend, (fake name) Arya. I moved away from our hometown to a different country with my husband. We rent a place from some really nice people. I let her know she could come visit anytime.

A couple of months pass and she wants to come to the country we live in to see a festival. She asks if she can stay with us; unfortunately we planned a vacation at that time but I tell her it's fine and that I'll give her the keys to our apartment somehow. She has other friends she could stay with, but prefers having a flat to herself. 
At this point I already have some conflicted feelings about this, as I'm not totally comfortable about leaving the keys to anyone; it's a rented place and we never talked to the landlords about situations like this, and I feel they wouldn't be 100% happy about it. 
My husband is also generally uncomfortable with both using other people's places while they are away and letting people stay at his place when he's not there, but he's willing to compromise in this situation as Arya and I are really close friends. I love her vey much and don't feel like telling her not to come; I want to do this favour for her.

A few weeks pass and we don't get a chance to see each other (I don't fly out to our hometown and she doesn't travel where we live either). We both totally forget about the whole thing and just 3 days before we leave for our vacation I message her about it and ask if she has any friends I could leave the keys to. She does, and gives me her contact. Her friend is extremely rude and tells me she can't take the keys as she's busy, but lets me know I can leave them to her mom (?) at her mom's workplace (??) and that if she's not there when I come I can leave them at the reception (???). 

At this point I'm getting extremely uncomfortable and I tell Arya that I don't really feel like doing this and ask her if she could change her mind and stay with her other friends. She gets extremely angry and doesn't talk to me for weeks. When we finally talk again, she won't really explain why she got angry and says that it's obvious.

AITA in this situation for asking her to reconsider staying at out place? We never really talked this out and just ignore it now, but it was a pretty big fight.

EDIT: Forgot to add this relevant bit of info - she ended up staying with her other friend, so she didn't miss out on her plans. "
"AITA for telling my friend to find her own hobbies and interests instead of just copying whatever her current boyfriend is into? | Title says it all. My friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. Last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn’t realize gaming could be so expensive. She dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn’t even have Candy Crush on her phone.

So I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. I reminded her that she enrolled in BJJ class when she dated a BJJ blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as I write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (Thank God the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn’t do it).

After dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn’t have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

AITA?

Edit: Yep, I'm reading the replies, all 3K of them, it's all very interesting. Not gonna reply to any because reddit people can be weird, I know if I reply to a YTA with anything other than ""I'm sorry you're right"" people will say ""Accept your judgment!"" and if I reply ""Thanks"" to an NTA I will be told I'm just looking for validation.

Shout out to @Durvillea who made the effort to DM me the same comment she made here, to quote:

Looks like you are one of those girls who are always fat + ugly inside out that you have to be jealous with your rich + pretty friend who always gets attention from guys and has enough money foe different new hobbies. Stop being bitter and leave her alone. You don’t need to also be mean to stay single af as you already are. Lol 

Girl thanks for your attention glad to know you're so interested in my life you have to try to talk to me through multiple channels."
"AITA: paid friend to clean house with certain requirements. Requirements not met. Flipped out. | To provide some important backstory: I own a 
 farm in the country. I have 21 dogs, and a few of them are human aggressive. People who come onto my property are under very strict instructions on which dogs to interact with. I have a breeding pair of dogs whose puppies are worth 2500 a pup. 

I have a friend who I offered to let move into one of my spare rooms, RENT FREE, as long as she handled all the cleaning. She hemmed and hawwed, said she didnt know because she wants to have people over a lot and I wont allow that, the internet is bad, etc. In my head I was like wow this is so rude, this is an excellent offer and you're just bitching about it. I offered this a month ago and she is still deciding. One of her reservations, which I agree with, is that she likes having people over whenever she wants at her current apartment and I won't allow that. People can come over, with prior planning and approval. 

So she has a friend and his girlfriend. I like the friend but DO NOT like the gf. When the gf was at my house she insinuated wanting to steal Wade (expensive dog) because I ""overcharge"" on his future puppies. She also taunted Rajiv (my most aggressive dog) after I said specifically ""do not interact with her. She wont touch you if you leave her be, but if you mess with her she will bite you. Just walk around her."". She kept tapping at Rajiv's butt and running away and laughing. So I said, this girl is not allowed on my property. I dont want a dog stolen and I don't want her getting mauled or killed by one of my animals. 

So I told my friend, look the place is a mess due to my recent surgery and I need it cleaned. I will give you 400 dollars to clean it and unpack some stuff I have. She said can I invite my friend to help. I said yes but not his girlfriend. The cleaning needs to be done Thursday (today) while I'm at medical appointments. Do not use the dishwasher, it is broken. 

I get home this afternoon and the house has maybe 1/6th the cleaning done. The dishes are in the dishwasher, not clean. My friend is here, and so are her friend AND HIS FUCKING GIRLFRIEND. I lost my shit. Asked why the girl was here and she responded rather snottily. Said I wasnt asking her, I was asking my friend who said she insisted she come. I DON'T FUCKING CARE. I told the girlfriend to leave and she bitched so I called one of the dogs over and had him growl at her and she scampered. 

At no point did my friend say sorry, just defended herself. I gave her 50 bucks for the cleaning they did and made them leave. I then texted her saying the move in offer is rescinded and I am absolutely furious. She keeps complaining. I laid into her and texted about how I feel disrespected, I am angry and hurt, I'm now really fucking screwed because i needed this cleaning done, etc. 


Edit: the dog I had growl at her is a very friendly dog who I taught to growl on command for fun. I only did it because I had repeatedly at this point told the girl to leave and she wouldnt. 

The aggressive dogs are not breeding dogs. I got them all separately as rescues. I'm managing them and letting them enjoy their lives on my farm.

"AITA for not believing I should pay a larger portion of rent than my SO? | Hello reddit, this is a throwaway

Im currently with my SO of two years living downtown in a populated city. We have been living together for 7 months now on a one year lease which amounts to $1095/mo. We currently have that split at half and have agreed to this since before even looking for apartments. She works 30h a week at a bank that makes a bit over $17/hr. Which totals to about $30k a year with some OT. I'm an engineer for our city and make over double what she does per hour and almost push 6 figures. 

Lately she feels it's not fair to her that she has to pay half when I make a good deal amount more than her. I don't feel that's fair or equal, nor do I feel I should have to. Since before moving together, I volunteered to pay the utilities, groceries, and any other upkeep type costs. And I have and still plan to. I also don't feel I should morally have to pay more in this scenario because I I chose a career path that made money, went through schooling, licensing, internships, etc to get to where I am. Where she honestly has kinda settled where she's at when she had the full opportunity to go to school (Her parents offered to pay for it if she maintained decent grades). She says she's content where she works at and the level she's on; which I'm happy for her on that and support. But feel I shouldn't have to pay more because I choose to pursue and work towards positions of higher pay and status.

Additionally, she does have disposable income. After rent for the month, she has over $900 to spend on any other expenses that aren't bills and groceries. She does have a building savings. And I even spend money on her when I want to surprise her. Two weeks ago I bought a pallette for her that was $120. So I'm not stingy with my money. 

AITA? If I am, then I am. I have no qualms with changing my mind. But genuinely feel, all things fair, half is what should be expected.


Edit: Thank you for all the responses (YTA and NTA). I wanted to respond to a couple posts to help those reading.


>YTA. You earn 3x what she does, you should be paying expenses proportionally to what you earn. Groceries and utilities doesn’t make up for that. She’s your partner, not your roommate

Thank you for that. I guess I never really thought about it like that but it does seem like I'm treating this more as a roommate scenario in some regards. I do need to work on that. And as for bills and groceries, totaling it up, it comes close to the ""proportional amount"" that'd be reached via income. As I have a 4k calorie/day high protein diet and she enjoys furthering her culinary skills with some more expensive (And damn tasty) foods. So those expenses do come out to about 2/3 on my part.


>Info You’re missing an important piece of information here. Whose standard of living are you maintaining?

We're maintaining both of our standards, but mostly hers. I took a downgrade from where I used to live due to me not finding it fair to pay more for my standard of living. I also took a longer commute so she could have a shorter commute.


>YTA because you think you’re better than her: “Where she honestly has kinda settled where she's at” “ But feel I shouldn't have to pay more because I choose to pursue and work towards positions of higher pay and status“

Not at all. It's to point my thought on the feeling of paying more when I choose to pursue where she in the long run will pay less and less because she doesn't want to pursue and wants to remain where she's at. It's almost like a negative aspect that I have to pay more if I want to keep climbing rungs. And I've said I'm happy she's happy with where she's at. I support her. I don't try to badger her to keep going. I'd be an ass if I did."
"AITA for explaining why I don't have Instagram? | I (21M) don't have instagram, which is abnormal for someone my age. A friend I've made recently (21F) found out recently and when we were hanging out in a group she was really shocked that I didn't have it. 

She asked me why I didn't have it and I said it's not my thing. But then she was still confused and said ""No seriously what's the real reason"".

So I said ""I don't have insta cos I value myself and my self worth. I don't need the validation of strangers to feel good."" She looked quite offended. I later learned she's quite profilic on insta and has like 10k followers. 

Well she told my friend (20M) I was an asshole. I feel a bit bad, but I also feel like I just stated the truth. AITA?"
"AITA for sending a “rude” email to my teacher | I didn’t think it was “rude” nor was it intended to be 
Throwaway just because


So we had to do this assignment where we read an article and do a summary on it for a Major Grade when she was absent.
I did the assignment and that was that.
But it showed up as a 0 in the grade book causing my grade go from a high A to a low B. I emailed her about it of course. This is the following email- 
Hi Ms Teacher,
It has caught my attention that a 0 was put into the grade book for the ""Article Review Wednesday- Summary"" which has demolished my grade. The thing is, is that I DID do the Article summary, and was wondering if this was a mistake. I would talk to you personally, but you appear to be absent today. Please, whenever you have the time, look into this and hopefully fix the problem.
Thanks, KitCat

I didn’t receive an email all weekend. When I came In today I asked her if she received me email, and she said yes but then went on to tell me (in summary) how rude it was and you don’t tell your teacher to “fix the problem” in a super rude tone. I told her I was so sorry and I meant no disrespect and I’m sorry she read it like that. I already have a rough history with this teacher (this one specific teacher) and started to panic not knowing what she’ll do. She then told me I most likely turned it in wrong. I didn’t. It apparently was “the internet”. 
I asked my friends to read the email and then asking if anything was wrong with it. Majority were shocked when I told them my teachers reaction. And a few thought it was passive aggressive in the first place.
AITA?"
"AITA for not sharing my prescriptions? | I (16F) have a very weird skin type with few skin conditions, I have photo dermatosis and Psoriasis. I also have very dry and sensitive skin. 

A while ago my friend asked me about my skin and said it looked nice, to which I ofcourse said thank you, she then asked me what type of products I use and what do I do for my skin. I said that I don't think she should use the products I use as they are prescribed by a doctor and not for her skin, as she has normal/oily skin and has pimples (which I also pointed), and it can affect her skin badly. 
I recommended her to a dermatologist and said that he's good, I also said sorry her to her.

I thought that this would be the end of it but she had spread rumours about me and how I'm so arrogant and over confident of my skin. When I confronted her she said, ' You're too arrogant about your skin, you don't deserve the face you have.' I'm so confused what she meant by this but my other acquaintances are berating me about that? I just didn't want her to mess up her skin.

I don't think I'm TA about this, the only thing I can think that Im wrong for is pointing out her pimples, but you all can decide?

Update:
So people are thinking that prescriptions can only be bought with prescription from doctor, I live in a 3rd world country and... that's not how it works here

Clearing something else too, my friend and I have known each other for 4 years and she has pointed out my acne (and other features) while I did the same, even if she felt bad because of that. Spreading rumours is not okay. I am in no way arrogant about my skin

Clearing another thing, prescription here is NOT products but rather the list given to you by doctors, she specifically asked me what I use for my skin, to which I didn't tell her about any product as I KNOW that she WILL buy those products as she HAS done in the past.

I will accept all the TAs and ESHs because truly I shouldn't have pointed out her acne, but this does not give her right to talk behind my back. I have already apologized to her, before posting this."
"AITA if I angrily confronted my friend about his bad breath? | So I think I fucked up, and I need to know if I was an asshole. I am pretty sure I am because I lost my temper, but...an outside perspective would help.

I run a gaming group (tabletop games like D&D, for context) that meets twice a month. One player has absolutely atrocious breath. Like other than that his hygiene is good and he's a really stand up guy. I've taken him aside twice in private to mention the breath issue very gently to him, offered him a mint, but he pointed out that no one else said anything to him, and he thought I was being rather rude. Anyways I noticed the other players started...not sitting as close to him as they used to, and I was pretty sure it was due to his gross breath. I'd tried to be gentle about this already, but when one of them scooted away when he moved his chair closer, he got mad and asked why we were all avoiding him at the table. It was so fucking uncomfortable and awkward, so I blurted, ""Dude, your breath is fucking *horrible*. I've tried telling you nicely and in private, but you keep not fixing it. Have a goddamn breath mint, and we'll all sit closer at the table. Don't want a breath mint? Then don't bitch when we don't want to sit near you sometimes.""

He got furious that I said this in front of everyone and left the group for that evening, saying that he'd never felt more humiliated in his life at a gaming group and that I didn't have to be so harsh. One of my players was grateful at my outburst (since him leaving meant they didn't have to smell his breath any more) but felt that I could have been way nicer about it & probably went overboard. One of my players thought my behavior was absolutely appalling and felt that I should have rode out the bad night, talked to everyone first, and then come up with a politer plan where we could all have had a gentle sit-down with him about the problem. One of my players 100% supported me and said that if he didn't want to get chewed out, maybe he should have listened when he got feedback before. We've all known each other a while, and I think my swearword-laden outburst may have torpedo'd my friendship with the bad-breath player, in all honesty. He said he isn't coming back to the game night. 

I kind of don't think he deserved any more polite approaches; I feel like he was an asshole to me for brushing me off when I was nice, so I feel justified in how I handled this even though I suspect it probably does make me the asshole. AITA?"
"AITA buying snacks my sisters hate with our common money | I am older brother of a pair of twin sisters, 14 and 10. Every week our parents would give us some money for snacks in addition to pocket money, which 3 of us were to share. It would be put into a jar in the living room and we are free to take from it.


My sisters would usually take all the money immediately and buy snacks for themselves, hiding them from me. After a while I complained to my parents about it and they set a rule that snacks should also be kept in the living room cabinet. It was then they started buying snacks I dislike, like seaweed BBQ flavored crackers and potato chips. Since I wouldn't eat them, they still ended up eating most of the snacks. I would say that I don't mind since I am older and things like that but no, I do mind when it becomes a common routine for my sisters.


So I took the money from the jar first this week and bought a load of durian puffs. I like durian puffs but my sisters hate them. They got angry at me and said that I stink up the whole cabinet of durian smell, even their stash got affected. They complained to our parents about it and they are calling me an immature brat. Why is it that they can do it and I cant? So sick of letting the girls having their way just because they are the younger and majority of us, I just want to enjoy some durian puffs myself, not like I buy them all the time, just this once. AITA?


UPDATE: For those confused about ""14 and 10"" age I meant that I am 14 and my sisters are 11, I phrased it wrongly and also forgotten their birthday passed.


Also, we were not supposed to ""split"" the money into 3 as our parents want us to buy snacks together. As the elder one I was also supposed to give more to my younger sisters. So we kind of ended up 2 vs 1 most of the times."
"AITAH For refusing to celebrate Christmas and refuse to accept and give gifts? | So I'm a atheist. Recently I figured it was hypocritical of me to celebrate religious holidays such as Easter and Christmas due to being  atheist. 
So i told my family last year I won't be celebrating Christmas and not to buy me anything as I won't be buying presents except for the children under 16, (I did give some cash to my 17 year old cousin). 

So it comes to Christmas day and I get multiple messages of family members asking where I am. Obviously they didn't take my request seriously and presumed I would still show up. I told them I'm not celebrating and carried on. I was in work from the 26th to new years so I had little contact with the extended family. 

On new years eve I had multiple people come up to me and complaining and calling me the arsehole for not showing up and they were mad about not receiving presents or cards. I asked if they purchased anything and they all said only small things. ""So you can return them? Or give them someone else for a birthday."" I asked politely. 

Apparently this offended some people. The only person on my side was weirdly my grandma who was basicly the only person who took my request to heart. 

Now many if them are refusing to invite me to non-religious events such as weddings, anniversary dinners and birthday parties. While this doesn't bother me too much I feel annoyed. 

AITAH. Should I just suck it up and go against my none-belief or was I justified."
"WIBTA for being proud of my body and saying no to what I think is a ridiculous request. | In LA summer is almost over, and we have a last BBQ hurrah at my in-law's place. My sister-in-law recently had a baby and she's had a tough process through the pregnancy including a big C-section and a lot of healing. I've been helping her and talking her through it (my own sister had troubles too).

Because of this context, despite it being a pool party, my mother-in-law, who is incredibly sweet but also incredibly nosy texts me how her daughter still feels very awkward about how her body is healing and if I am to bring any swimwear to the party to make it a one-piece. 

Most of the rest of the crowd is going to be older people who are friends with their in laws and only a few couples of our generation. She tells me it'll make sister-in-law feel a little better. 

I don't even have a one-piece swimwear and if I am being honest, I was looking forward to a weekend lounging by the pool and relaxing. My husband doesn't know about this, and I'm not sure I want to involve him.

WIBTA if I tell her no, sorry, it's too late to shop for a one piece and I'll do my best or whatever? Or just skip bringing over beach wear and enjoy the party? But I was really looking forward to it!"
"AITA for refusing to tell my future baby’s name to my older sister? | (This isn’t my story but my aunt’s, who asked me to post it here cause she needed other people’s opinions)

I’m pregnant and should be due in a few weeks or so. I learned a while back that my baby was a girl and therefore chose her name in consequence. The only ones that are privy to this information are me and my husband and I’ve refused to share it with anyone else given that sharing your baby’s name prior to their birth is bad luck. 

Oddly enough, my older sister has been deeply hurt by this, bringing up many times the fact that she had done everything for me during my pregnancy, from letting me live under her roof despite the fact that she had 4 children (forcing them to all sleep in a room meant for 1 person) and that she severely lacked space already. She helped me get my appointments and it is true that if she hadn’t been there for me, I’d most likely have lost my baby. 

She said that she wasn’t asking for much, just wanted to know I trusted her and actually cared about the fact that she helped me but I don’t know, I think she’s just being selfish ? I didn’t ask her to help me, nor did I force her to pack her kids in one room and let me stay there for 2 months. I’m obviously grateful for it but now she’s making a huge deal of me not wanting to tell her my daughter’s name when nobody else knows. She even brought up the fact that I hadn’t made any effort to go see her ever since I left her home, but once again, I’m pregnant and she has a lot of kids so her house is very loud which makes me not want to go there. Couldn’t she just visit me if she wanted to see me ? 

TLDR : My older sister is angry at me for refusing to tell her my future child’s name because I think it’s bad luck

Edit: I should probably also say that my sister isn’t mad at me per say, she just expressed that she was hurt by the fact that I had been avoiding her ever since I left her home and that now I didn’t even trust her enough to tell her a simple name "
"AITA for “shit-shaming” my roommate? |   

I live with 2 guys my age in a 3 BR 2 BA apartment. I was friends with one (P) before we moved out here and the other was a friend of P (T). Before agreeing to live together I talked with P and he said they were pretty clean.

After 2 weeks I realize we have VERY different standards for cleanliness. I not a neat-freak but good lord they were gross. At first cleaned up after them, but once it became routine I spoke up and told them to clean up their own messes. They never did and I was left cleaning.

On Thursday I come home and go to the bathroom, but the toilet was to the brim with murky brown water and big doodoo chunks. We have 2 bathrooms. P uses one and T and I use the other. I come out and theyre watching TV. I asked “Who fucked the toilet?” knowing full well it was T. Neither of them say anything. “T I know it was you, can you go clean it up? Its nasty and I need to go” T says “Are you serious?” I respond “What? Its your mess.” He goes “Are you really shit-shaming me? Everyone is fucking ashamed of when they take a shit. Yeah ok I clogged the toilet. MY. BAD. That doesnt give you any right to go and talk about me shitting to the whole world”

Im lost and answer “Ok… but are you going to clean up the toilet or…?” T says “Dont know how” Even more lost I ask “Dont know how to clean or dont know how to use a plunger?” He yells “Dude not everyone is a fucking mechanical engineer and knows how everything works” I answered “You dont need to be a M.E. to push your shit down a tube” At this point P joins in and says “If you care so much why dont you just clean it up?” I answer “There’s no way Im cleaning up someone elses turds, this is on T”

Come Saturday the toilet is still clogged. Im refusing to cave because Ive been caving and cleaning their messes ever since we moved in. No chance I let them win this round. I decide to teach T a lesson and show him that his messes arent going to just “go away” by literally shaming him with his own shit. While they were out Saturday night I rigged the bathroom. I aimed an IR sensor at the door and mounted a servo to the back of the toilet with a cable snaking into the well and tied to the water feed plunger so that when T opened the bathroom door the servo would pull on the cable, open the plunger and allow water to feed into the bowl which, already completely full, would overflow onto the floor covering his feet in his own soggy, neglected shit.

That night T brought a girl home from the bar. I didnt know this until I heard the scream. She was the first one to go into the bathroom and tripped the trap. T came running out and I could hear him completely panicking. The girl grabbed her stuff and took off. I came out and T was still freaking out and I said “Shoulda just cleaned it up” And then went back into my room.

T cleaned up the mess and it reeks in the apartment but they didnt know I had anything to do with what happened. So Reddit AITA for “shit-shaming” my roommate?"
"WIBTA if I remove my ex-girlfriend from my friend group's extensive group chat? | Throwaway because feels necessary.

I (24M) broke up with my girlfriend (21F) of, like, 3 months after a hot and heavy relationship. The issue is, she was added to our large and long-running group chat at the forefront of the relationship.

This is a well-loved, bit-fueled, and long-running chat in our friend group. After we broke up I didn't remove her because we were still friends. There was a really weird time around Thanksgiving when she blocked me because of a misunderstanding but she remained in the group chat. She's since unblocked me, but it's still a really uncomfortable dynamic despite her finding a new partner. I can't really make jokes about being lonely and horny without her getting mad even though things have moved on. I want to remove her from chat, but I do care about her and I know she enjoys being a part of the chat - I'm just not sure this is a healthy dynamic.

She's not fully ingrained in the friend group, but people do like her. Nobody has said they'd really be mad if she's removed and that they understand the tension. WIBTA if I just remove her? I don't want to hurt her feelings but it's just so weird.

EDIT: I just want to say thank you to everyone who took time out of there day to give me advice for this stupid petty issue. Everyone, except for the person who said horny posting is cringe - your goofy."
"AITA for telling my girlfriend that getting her nails done is a waste of money | For some context, we've been dating for 6 months. We started dating right as she was graduating college and has not found a job yet. I'm a year older so I've been working to support us both while she is still job searching (we started living together a month into the relationship so that she could move out of her parents house). Every time she gets an interview for a job she wants, she insists on getting her nails done as she believes that this is an important factor when interviewing. 

&#x200B;

She gets very upset when I ""shame"" her for spending money on nails, because she was apparently raised to believe that this is a necessary step for hygiene maintenance among women. She assumes that I just don't understand because I'm a male. I've suggested cheaper alternatives like painting her own nails which she refuses to do because she is not as good at it as the people who do it for a living.

Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for calling my mom unfair? | Two weeks ago we had taco night. My mom made a bunch of meat, beans, corn, etc. My brothers got to the kitchen about ten minutes before me to make their tacos and as I entered, my little brother was finishing making his fifth taco and used up the last of the beef. I was pissed because they didn’t save me any and the meat is the best part of the taco. 

I told them to give me some meat and they ignored me and went to the living room and started eating. I went to my mom to tell her what they did and she didn’t even care. She didn’t tell either of them to give me some meat, so I had bean tacos instead. Not terrible but I was kind of mad about the selfishness. 

Flash forward to yesterday morning and my mom made eggs and bacon. I got to the kitchen first, followed by older brother, then my little brother about ten minutes later. I took one third of everything that was made, and my older brother took the rest even though he asked me if my little brother had eaten yet and I said no. What a dick move. 

Anyways, my little brother comes and sees that nothing was left, and tells our mother and all hell broke loose. She yelled at us that he hadn’t eaten yet, he is to eat first from now on, and that we shouldn’t have eaten it all. She then made him a separate breakfast. 

I think this is unfair because she didn’t do the same for me. I couldn’t even convince her to. Furthermore, I took my fair share, whereas he took way more than he should’ve. I called her out on it and she wouldn’t respond. Then my brothers said I was TA. I disagree. What does Reddit think?"
"AITA for ""flaunting my wealth"" at work, and refusing to stop? | 
EDIT: Yes, my boss is also my dad. But it is an ENGINEERING firm, so I didnt just get given the job. I have had to work for qualifications just like everyone else. I work hard and pull my weight as I would with any job. I did not start at a higher salary, I am on an entry level salary as you would expect from any one else. I did not mention this as when it comes to business the father-son dynamic is practically non existent, he is the employer and director and I am an employee and consultant. 
As for packages being delivered, it was every couple of months at the most frequent, not multiple times a day or even week. 


I work in a small engineering firm with about 8 people. We all make good money, but I am young, debt free, and have very few expenses. So compared to the older guys who have kids, mortgages, amd other stuff I have a pretty high amount of disposable income. I order expensive PC parts into the office, have a small collection of watches, and like to wear quality work clothes to make sure I look professional. Thats really all I do. I dont discuss salary with anyone, I dont talk about how much these things cost, I just wear my clothes and watches and occasionally get packages delivered. Ill talk about things if asked (one of my coworkers likes computers as well so will talk to me about my PC components) but I dont bring it up of my own accord. 

One of my coworkers, X, is the opposite. He is older, has 2 young kids, a house he is paying off, and his wife is unemployed. He dresses quite poorly for an office setting (ill fitting clothes, jeans, sneakers) however I have never made any comment on his attire or his situation. 

The boss pulled me aside the other day to discuss something, and it turns out X has made a complaint that I am making him uncomfortable by openly having spending money, which he does not have. I was asked to stop ordering things into the office unless absolutely necessary (fair enough) and to ""tone down"" my work attire. I asked what this meant, and was told to:
- Wear only one watch to work every day, instead of changing the watch to match my clothes.
- wear more generic style business shirts 
- wear a more plain pair of leather shoes

I said no, that is unreasonable. As long as I look professional it shouldn't matter what I wear, and if that makes people uncomfortable then it's their issue, not mine. So unless their is a formal change to the dress code I will continue to wear what I have been wearing. I also said that if the boss wants everyone to look unprofessional that's his call, but I didnt agree with it. I was then told to expect a formal warning and that we would have a further discussion on friday (tomorrow). I dont think im wrong, but i would like an outside opinion on the matter.

AITA for this?"
"AITA for doing the same thing as my wife? | My wife recently decided she doesn't want to give oral anymore. Her reason is that she doesn't like it and so doesn't think she should have to do it. Ofcourse she's right, no one can force her to give oral, and she's entirely within her right to refuse oral to me.

That said, I've always hated having Friday night dinners with my in-laws. My in-laws are nasty judgemental people and for the last 10+ years I've spent almost every Friday night - when I should be relaxing from a long week's work - with people that I honestly detest on some level. Why do I do this? Because it makes my wife happy and I want her to be happy.

So I told my wife that's fine - she doesn't have to, but that I'd also like to stop doing something which I hate - spending every friday with my in-laws.

She says I'm an asshole and that the situations are different. I disagree, we're both stopping something we hate despite it making the other happy. I think we're both within our right to do so and neither of us are assholes.

"AITA For asking my friend for a beer on my birthday? | This weekend I went on a big camping trip with my friends, my boyfriend and some of his friends (who at this point I know really well and I consider friends too).  I bought a bunch of food and drinks and paid for all the camp sites.

It was kind of a hectic and stressful weekend and I had to actually kick someone out for fighting and keeping us up all night. I hadn't really slept.  Eventually we were all sitting around the fire and I didn't have any more beers left and I really wanted a beer. By this point though all of my closer friends had gone to bed and it was just me and my BF and his dude friends. The only person with beers left was one of my boyfriend's friends who I have always gotten along with and I even drove down there. I asked him for a beer and he said no because he only had a few left.

I wasn't super drunk or anything, it's not like I had drank all the drinks I brought, I had been sharing everything with everyone.  All I wanted was one last beer on my birthday camping trip and he said no.  I then proceeded to get kind of mad and I kept asking him. I know it was immature but I couldn't believe he was serious. I told him it was my birthday and that I would buy him more beer when we left the next day etc. etc. Probably being sleep deprived and stressed out fueled my anger. I did remain calm and didn't yell at him or call him an asshole. Again I was not belligerent or wasted, I just wanted a beer after a long day.

My boyfriend then told me I was being annoying and to stop pestering him and that I was being a fiend and all this stuff and I was upset at him because it was my birthday and I had literally shared everything with his friend and everyone else and now he wouldn't give me a single beer. We got into a huge fight over it and kind of agreed to disagree. It's been two days and he's kind of brought that he still thinks I was being a brat, which still makes me mad.

I told my other friends about this and they think that he should have just given me a beer, since a. it was my birthday and b. he had drank a bunch of my beers and eaten my food and he still had a couple left. My BF's friends think I was being really annoying and entitled and that I couldn't use my birthday as an excuse to get a beer.

Was I being the asshole for asking him for a beer?

Edit: the next day I did go up to him and apologize for pestering him and he said ""I wasn't that bad"" and did not apologize but we are ""okay"" now. I'm just kind of annoyed that by BF still thinks I was a brat and didn't stand up for me mostly.

Edit 2: I should have mentioned this before but earlier in the day I had asked my BF to ask 2 of his other friends to leave. They were a couple and they ended up fighting super loudly all night long keeping everyone up and upsetting my friends.  He said he would but kept putting it off and riding his dirtbike or whatever and I finally got fed up and just asked them myself (they were cool about it and totally understood). So part of the reason I was so mad at him was because he first did not do what I had asked him and then he didn't stand up to me to his friend and instead called me a brat."
"AITA for how I spoke to a Starbucks employee? | The other day, my dad's fiancé asked if I could pick up her daughter from school and wait with her at a nearby Starbucks until she came to take her home herself since I would be in the area right around the time her school was let out. I agreed to do so, and when we got to Starbucks, I bought her a snack and a hot chocolate and got myself some water. 

My dad's fiancé ended up stuck in traffic, so she was even later than she expected. Soon, it was ten minutes until closing time (6 PM) and she still hadn't arrived. At this point, one of the employees approached us and informed us that they would be closing in ten minutes. 

""Okay, thanks,"" I told her. ""We'll pack up our stuff in a few minutes."" 

She nodded and left. I only had my laptop out, and I was nearing the end of a sports news article. My stepsister (well, future stepsister) was playing a game on her phone. 

One minute later, the lady comes back and says, ""Nine minutes until closing."" 

Okay, I thought. That's a bit strange considering she was just here, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe she just forgot or something. 

I repeated what I said to her earlier and she went on her way. 

However, one minute later, she came back *again* and said, ""Eight minutes until closing time."" 

By now I was getting pretty annoyed, but I kept my cool and replied, ""Thanks, we'll be packing our things up in about two minutes."" 

She left. 

And then she came back yet again and said, ""Seven minutes until closing time."" 

At this point, I finally lost my temper and snapped back, ""Yeah, I heard you the first three times you came over here. I don't need you to give me a countdown."" 

So, what do you think? AITA for how I spoke to her?"
"AITA for wanting to swim laps in my neighborhood pool? | I just moved into an HOA. I pay a monthly fee which covers maintenance of common areas and amenities, including a pool.

The pool has a number of rules and guidelines, one of which is that any resident can request a lap swim at the top of the hour for 20 minutes. For example, at 2:40 p.m., I could tell the lifeguard I would like to swim laps and they would clear the pool for 20 minutes. The pool is small so even if two children were playing in the pool with one person swimming laps, the children would get in the way of the lap swimmers.

Yesterday, I requested a lap swim and everyone had the clear the pool while I swam. A woman came up to me after I had finished swimming, and told me that it was rude to have everyone get out so that one person can swim laps. I told her it was in the rules I received and she said no one ever requests a lap swim because it inconveniences everyone else. She told me to go swim at a gym if I really want to swim laps. I told her that I pay a fee to swim here, just like she does, and I don’t want to pay to use a gym as well.

AITA for wanting to swim laps in my neighborhood pool?

EDIT: It's actually common for many pools to have ""adult swims"" where children must clear the pool for 10 minutes every hour to take a break. In our pool, we allow children to swim laps with the adults if they wish. I can only swim at certain times: 12:40, 1:40, etc. until 8 p.m. on the weekend. (Pool hours are noon to 8 p.m., Monday through Sunday.) Other swimmers may swim at any other time unless an adult or child calls for a lap swim. We don't have mandatory clearings of the pool every hour since we have two guards. This only occurs if someone (an adult or a child) wants to lap swim."
"AITA for “ruining” my friends shirt | I know the title sounds bad , but hear me out. So a couple days ago my friend and I were in our art class together , and she came up to me and put a little bit of neon blue paint on my brand new jeans. So I wanted to retaliate (as a joke, because she was laughing at the time too) and I got some brown paint and put it on her “expensive” (I didn’t know it was expensive at the time) red shirt. When I did she moved a little and so it was a little more than just a finger print of paint. So she got mad at me, because and I quote “I just put a small amount of blue paint on your pants and you ruined my shirt”. Other kids in class agree with her and say that I took it too far.
I’ve tried apologizing
What do you think?
So AITA? 
Please let me know"
"AITA for skipping my niece's birthday because I'm beefing with my sister? | My sister and I don't get along. I used to envy and worship her. Our relationship crumbled when she would nag me about why I haven't moved out (can't afford to but I pay rent) or gotten a career (like I've haven't been interviewing but coming in 2nd or 3rd). She would always say how she did everything on her own and no one helped her. I found out that my mother was the one who helped her get her first professional job and assisted her financially. That really pissed me off that my sister would lie to me like that so I stopped talking to her.


Things got worse when she married this rich stuck up snob who looked down on us. He loves my sister but dislikes her family. So I distanced myself even further. To be real, I felt like she didn't want to be associated with us and that is cool.

She has a daughter and I have no relationship with her. This upsets my sister. I agree to a do-over with my sister because she really wanted me to go to her birthday party. I have never met her. As the day approached, my sister started acting weird. She'd tell me not to come if I was going to beef with her husband. I don't care enough about him to beef with him. He's the one who doesn't like me. Then she says it's not a big deal if I don't come because it's just cupcakes as if I was expecting a fucking full course meal. So I decided to skip it. Not worth my time. I have enough problems.

Because I didn't go, she's furious at me because I said I would go. Either she's pretending or is so glib that she alienated me. I bring that up and she says I'm making up excuses."
"AITA for loudly calling out a group of women who were making fun of another woman? | I was at a shop buying some clothes with a long line. A group of three women were behind me in line, and it looked like a mom, grandma, and teenage daughter. Ahead of me a few paces in line was a gorgeous woman with very obvious fake boobs. She was dressed in a semi-revealing outfit (some sideboob, some cleavage) but was well put together, was polite to the others around her, etc. 

Well the three women behind me started snickering and making little comments about the woman the whole time I was in front of them. They were nasty slut-shamey comments, comments about her body, her fake boobs, etc. I glanced behind them and they must have thought I was in agreement with them or something because they got a little more loose. 

I got really fed up with it and as soon as it was my turn, I turned around and said, ""Hey, is there something you wanted to say to the woman at the register? The woman you've been talking about?""

All three of them looked shocked and the grandma said something like ""No...""

I said ""Well then why were you just making those nasty comments about her? Did she do something to you?""

""No...""

""Wow, you're setting a great example for your daughter, tearing down other women like that. I bet she's going to turn out to be a real winner.""

The two older women started to turn red and the teenager looked like she was about to cry. I went up to the register and they were dead quiet. After a second the teenager started crying and all three of them put their clothes aside on the display racks next to the line and left. But not before the grandma spat ""You had no right to talk to us that way, you nosy little bitch.""

I felt bad for making the teenager cry but she was a part of it, too. But a couple of people in the line made little comments about minding my own business and respecting my elders. Sorry but I think respect is earned, not taken for granted. Does that make me the asshole?"
"AITA For wanting a cake I already paid for? | Hey everyone, so I’m a bit conflicted and I want some judgement on whether or not IATA.

Last Friday I ordered a cake from a family owned bakery in the area for my mother. I was told the cake would be done by Saturday afternoon, and should pick it up then. So far everything is good, I pay the full price for the cake and go about my business.

When Saturday rolls around I run into a slight medical emergency which occupies my till late after the bakery has closed. At that point I had nearly forgotten about it. Regardless, I received no call from them, so I figure I’ll simply pick up my cake Tuesday (The shop is closed Sunday and Monday).

So today I walk in and ask for my cake. The young lady goes into the back and after 15 minutes of searching they can’t find my cake anywhere. As a compromise, they offer me a display cake, which I gladly accept. 

About 10 minutes after I leave, the shop calls me and informs me of the situation. Apparently, since I was unable to pick up the cake Saturday they threw it out without telling me, which is why they were unable to find my cake. Since I took one of the cakes, the lady asks that I pay for another cake for the one I took from the display.

Am I the asshole for not wanting to pay for the second cake, considering both parties had a miscommunication?"
"WIBTA if I (f23) told my boyfriend (m29) that I’d only move in with him if we had separate bedrooms? | I’m sure the obvious answer at a glance is that I’m TA, but I’m still gonna go into detail. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 9 months and his lease is ending in less than a month. He was living with his ex (they were together when they originally moved in over a year ago) so renewing their lease together was out of the question. He says he can’t really afford anything in our city without a roommate and I’m currently living with my mom since I just finished college. So it would be the obvious choice us to move in together.

With our age difference, it’s important to note that I’ve never lived with an SO, while he has moved in with girlfriends in the past, sometimes out of necessity, despite only being with them for a short while. I’m a lot more hesitant in this regard, and it seems like it’s a much bigger step for me than it would be for him. One that I don’t want to rush into and possibly strain the relationship. But he’s been saying it’s either that or he’ll have to move because he can’t afford to live in our city alone.

I was considering telling him the decision for me to move in with him might be made easier if I knew I would still have my own space (ie, my own bedroom). This isn’t to say I wouldn’t still be spending most nights with him in his, but just so that I can still be alone when I feel like I need to recharge my social battery and check in with myself, since I have a history of social anxiety and depression. He also has a 5 year old daughter that he would have on the weekends, and if I had my own bedroom, it would make it easier for them to share his, when she was there (according to him, she’ll cry if he isn’t there sleeping with her.) 

WIBTA if I brought this idea up to him?"
"AITA For going to 'expensive' restaurants in sweatpants and a shitty t-shirt? | It's in Seattle if that matters. It seems people are a lot more casual here.

I was eating at a steakhouse I like and there was a family there who were there for like an anniversary or wedding or something. Bunch of people all dressed up obviously big get to do. 

I didn't think much about it at the time but I was talking to some people online and they said that you have like a basic responsibility to dress up at least a little at these places. The atmosphere is a big part of the experience and that I'm kind of ruining that. Also that it shows lack of 'respect' for people around me.

AITA?

EDIT: How do I flair as asshole?

I totally don't get why people care about the atmosphere (I'm there for the food) but if they care and I'm not respecting that...I'm the asshole.

I'll be ordering my food ahead of time and leaving with it from now on. "
"AITA - Not all Canadian's are Nice | Backstory: I am from Ontario Canada. Everyone goes 20km/hr over the speed limit. Its a $200+ fine and 2 demerit points if you are going below the speed limit; known as 'impeding traffic'

Event that I am questioning if I am an asshole: I drive the same route to work every day, it is a two lane road that goes down to one lane and then goes back to two lanes again. The speed limit is 50km/hr for most of it. I know exactly where all of the potholes are on the road. I have blown out a tire in the past on a bad pothole. I was driving along and caught up to guy doing the speed limit. I leave a respectable amount of space between us. He slowed down to doing 35km/hr. I was getting a little annoyed because that was much slower then the speed limit so I went to pass him when the lines went from solid double yellow to dashed yellow. There was no traffic coming in the other direction. When I started to move into the other lane to pass, he swerved in front of me so that I couldn't pass him. I moved back into my proper lane & followed behind the guy again. I would have just kept following him but he slowed down to 20km/hr. After the car passed us by I went to go and pass him again, and he swerved in front of me again to keep me from passing.

When it starts to go back to being two lanes again, there are nasty blow out potholes in the right lane. We hit the area where it becomes two lanes and I am thinking, okay. I am in a higher vehicle, I can survive the potholes if I'm careful. And I get into that lane. EXCEPT; I know that this asshole in front of me is going to get in front of me to cut me off... So I let him get in front of me, and he isn't paying attention to the road, and I quickly merge back into the left lane (there is no traffic behind me) and as I drive by him, he is laughing his ass off at me because he thinks he has screwed me over... Then he blows his tire on the pothole that I knew was in that lane.... Does that make me an asshole?"
"AITA for not lending my pajama shorts to my cousin to wear when her swimsuit bottoms ripped? | 

Went on a trip to the mountains recently with my family. The place we were staying at was up away from the city. We actually had to take motorskis to get up there.The big draw of the place was some natural hot springs where we could all relax.

By the time we get there it’s getting dark so we decide to wait to hike up to the hot springs the next day. The next day we’re getting ready and putting our swimsuits on under our clothes so we only had to change once out in the cold.

When I get out of the bathroom My cousin and her mom were looking at her swimsuit. It had gotten snagged on the bathroom cabinet and had a big rip.

 I go to fold and put away my pajamas in my bag. My aunt notices and then says my cousin could just borrow my pajamas bottoms.

When I say they’re the only things I brought to wear to bed my aunt says she can lend me a pair of sweats.

I don’t sleep well with long pajama bottoms at all. I always end up waking up too hot and feeling strangled with them twisting around my legs.

So I told them no because I knew I wouldn’t sleep well if I was forced to wear sweats. If she borrowed my shorts they would probably be wet and clammy by the time we hiked back to the cabin. Even if I was able to get them dry by bedtime it’s kind of weird/gross to me to be constantly switching off wearing my shorts for the whole weekend.

I could tell my aunt was annoyed with me saying no. She ended up cutting up her sweats into shorts. But they looked pretty bad and uneven because we didn’t have any scissors.

When we got to the hot springs another group was already there at the hot springs. It was pretty fun because they had other kids our age. 

My cousin though didn’t have fun. She was really embarrassed getting in and out of the hot springs because one of the other kids said something about the cut up sweats she was wearing. I didn’t find this out until later.

The next day my cousin said she couldn’t find the cut up sweats (she ended up throwing them out) and asked to borrow my pajama bottoms again. I again told her no because I would still need them for that night.

My cousin was taking a really long time getting ready so the rest of us went on without her, her mom, and her dad. Her mom and dad ended up coming to the hot springs later. 

I didn’t hear what they talked with the other adults about (I was with my other cousins on the other side of the hot springs), but I did see my aunt give me an angry look a couple times.

My cousin didn’t come out of her parents bedroom until the next morning when we were leaving. 

Since then my aunt has called my mom and they got into a fight about me not helping out her daughter. She was saying I ruined the trip for them and my cousin didn’t even get to enjoy the hot springs once."
"AITA for showing little gestures of affection to my girlfriend while out to dinner with her family? | For some background, my girlfriend and I, 22 and 23, have been together for 3 and a quarter years. I'm an affectionate man, I like to put my hand on my girlfriends leg and also give her short (few second long) back scratches under and/or over the shirt on her lower back, which she really enjoys. 

With that said, Im showing those gestures of affection to my girlfriend while we're out to dinner with her dad, uncle, and grandma. 

The next day I get a stern talking to from her grandma about how my manners are misplaced and how I make my girlfriend look like a slut, and supposedly the rest of the family agreed, despite them not bringing it up, or being like the type people who care about a lower back scratch in public.
My girlfriend and I were shocked by the sudden outburst from the grandma. 

AITA and in the wrong here?"
"AITA for expecting that he works at my father’s deli until he finds other work? | My boyfriend lost his job in January.  He was working tech support.  He’s been looking for something similar to what he was doing, but he’s still out of work.  He had to borrow money from his family to cover his half of rent/bills.  

My father owns a deli and has offered him full time work until he finds another tech support job.  My boyfriend doesn’t want to though, he says that he’s awful at that kind of thing.  I explained that at most he would have to make a sub, but probably he would just be stocking shelves and cleaning.  I have a feeling that the real reason he doesn’t want to take the job is out of pride.  He’s been out of work for two months though and I feel like it’s time to swallow it and take the hand up.  "
"AITA for walking away from a flight attendant as she was lecturing me for using the first class bathroom? | I fly frequently - three or more times per month - with an airline not always know for the friendliest customer service. I have premier status with the airline, so I generally get to choose my seat and get the row directly behind first class if I’m not upgraded.

Last night I was in the row right behind first class, and had a flight attendant who had been acting particularly bizarrely to my fellow passengers (super stringent with rules, reprimanding people for little stuff, and making extra announcements outside the norm for flights like this).

So before landing, the FA makes this announcement about how if you need to stow your carry-one or use the bathroom, you should do it now. I wouldn’t say this is a common announcement, particularly given how casually but still urgently she worded it.

This announcement created a massive rush for the back bathrooms, and the line was at least four people deep. That said, there was no line for the first class bathroom, which was *only three rows ahead of my seat*. 

I needed to use the bathroom, so I went ahead and used the bathroom up front in first class.

When I exited the bathroom, the flight attendant was directly outside the bathroom door, so close I almost hit her with it (she had obviously been waiting for me).

She proceeded to angrily tell me that I had used the wrong bathroom, etc. Franky, I’d had a long and difficult work day and didn’t feel like listening to her lecture. So I said interrupted to say “thank you for telling me” and walked away.

She proceeded to follow me to my seat and in a voice loud enough for many to hear said “it’s extremely rude to walk away from people when they’re talking to you, don’t you think?”

At this point I just ignored her and she stalked away. 

AITA here? I get that there are safety regulations and stuff, but I’ve used the front bathroom before and no FA has said anything. I also know FAs have really hard jobs, but I don’t feel like I did anything to purposefully make her job harder. Frankly, her lecture felt like a bombardment and totally unnecessary.

TL;DR: Used the “wrong bathroom,” got yelled at, walked away, got followed and called rude by the flight attendant,

EDIT: Thanks all - super interesting opinions in the comments, and fascinating how divided people seem to be. I think it’s safe to say that we both made some iffy decisions, and it’s always better to ask first.  

I’m headed to my third of six flights this week soon, so I’ll get lots of chances to practice using the bathroom without pissing anyone off.

EDIT #2: This doesn’t matter much, but I am a woman. Only mentioning because it’s getting confusing reading all of the comments mentioning “her” and realizing they’re about the FA, not myself. *Either way - interesting how philosophical this post has become. Thank you all for your opinions.*

EDIT #3: Wasn’t gonna update but some of y’all have skin in the game. I ended up reporting the situation. The airline apologized and issued some award miles (which for the record I didn’t ask for)."
"AITA for not paying part of my friends ticket that he received while high? | So weed was recently legalized in Canada, and my friends are having a field day. For context, I'm not a fan of smoking it myself as I don't really like the feeling, couldn't give two shits if anyone else smokes though. So the five of us are in my friends car and they all (including the driver) decide to smoke while I don't. 

My friend then decides to drive to the local pizza place, but is pulled over by a cop for (rightfully) smelling the scent of marijuana. My friend gets a $500 ticket and expects everyone to pay a share. The other 3 agree to pay but I don't, because to me, I was neither the driver nor did I smoke any weed that night. Their point is that I was in the car and didn't offer to drive.

So Reddit, AITA?"
"AITA for disliking Little Caesar's Pizza? | Yesterday me and my friend decided to try out Little Caesar's Pretzel Crust Pizza. I bought the pizza, we went to my house, and we tried it out. Me personally, I didn't like it. It just had a average pizza taste and the pretzel crust didn't really add anything other than a slightly saltier flavor. I didn't care for it and I made my thoughts known to my friend. Believe it or not, he was actually mad at me. 

He starts saying stuff like ""You always act like you're so smart."" and he told me off for using ""big words"" and ""trying to sound like a food critic"". I was confused by where he was coming from. He then starts telling me that it's the best pizza he's ever had. I said to him ""You must not have had many pizzas if you think that THIS is the best pizza."" That was enough for him to just snatch the whole pizza box from me and say that he's having it to himself since I don't like it. And guess what? He eats the entire box and not only that, but he was also using a piece of crust to wipe up an any excess grease from the inside of the box and he was eating that as well. 

It was disgusting what he was doing and I had to step in and call him out when he just lazily tosses the empty box on my floor. I told him to pick it up and toss it, but he says ""Not until you get better taste in food."" Was he seriously this upset about me not liking this pizza? I then snapped at him and said ""I'm not gonna get lectured about good taste from someone who comes from a white trash family who eats nothing but fast food every day."" He just left my place and that was that.

Am I at fault over this? I admit that I may have crossed a line with my white trash comment, but he started it with overreacting to my reaction to the pizza. What do you think?"
"AITA for tipping food instead of money? | For lunch today, I ordered five sandwiches for me and my friends from our local chain. The Uber eats guy arrived 20 minutes later with 6 burgers instead of five.

I checked my order and it turns out I made a mistake and didn’t know what to do with the other burger (I didn’t argue with the delivery guy). I decided to give the 6th burger (with fries and soda) to the delivery guy as a tip.

He seemed surprised but basically left and seemed happy. However, when I told this to my friends I was grilled and they told me that I was treating the delivery guy like a homeless person who begs for food and that I was a cheapskate. 

TLDR: I accidentally  ordered an extra combo burger and decided to give it to the delivery driver as a tip

Thank you in advance"
"AITA for telling my sister to look up her questions on google instead of asking me? | AITA for telling my sister to look up her questions on google instead of asking me?

So I (16 M) have always been interested in Minecraft. I used to play a lot more a few months ago, but I started getting interested in other games. I still know how to play though. My sister (15 F) just started to get into Minecraft because she needed to have something to do. Anyways, when she first started, she asked for help when it came to controls, crafting, and stuff like that. This was about 2 weeks ago and she’s been doing pretty decent. She still plays like a new player but she’s having fun so that’s what really matters.

So lately I’ve been getting slightly annoyed because even though she’s been playing for 2 weeks, she keeps asking me for help for everything. She’ll ask me how to craft something, what biomes to find certain things in, and easy questions like that. I wouldn’t really mind if she wouldn’t ask like 10 questions every time she starts a session (not an exaggeration).

So yesterday I was chilling in my room listening to music and she asked me how to do something (it wasn’t something that couldn’t be looked up). I answered and said “hey, can you just start to look up you questions first?” And she was like “okay I guess I won’t bother you anymore” in a clearly annoyed voice. She hasn’t bothered me anymore but she’s been pretty stand-off-ish. Was I TA?"
"AITA for getting pissy at a cleaning company feedback that they gave to me ? | As honestly as possible:

&#x200B;

I ordered a 7h15min cleaning for my 55m2 ( 592ft2 ) appartment ( filthy af, I know ), and told in the description that "" there's lots of garbage and dust "". The cleaner did an amazing job and I praised them in the feedback form that they sent me.

&#x200B;

Shortly after the company sent me an email that "" these kinds of clearance cleanings (sry no idea what's the correct term) don't belong to us, we expect the appartment to be in reasonable order and shape "".

&#x200B;

I assumed that the company knew what to expect when the time was 7h15min for relatively small appartment but then they send me this crap. I'm beyond pissed right now. In their T/C they don't say anything about "" cleararance cleanings "" nor do they specify anything about overall tidiness.

&#x200B;

The subtotal for the cleaning was 304eur/338usd which to me is a huge amount of money and personally I felt kind of belittled and ridiculed after the feedback THEY sent ME, which isn't a norm in Finland. Prior to their feedback I hadn't sent anything, just read it like 10min ago.

&#x200B;

I replied to them that "" use a little bit of common sense and read the description and duration and don't send me this if it's not what your company does. thanks to the cleaner, from now on I'll use another company. Either call after the order or add it to your t/c "".

&#x200B;

So AITA for getting salty at their feedback ?

&#x200B;

Kind of minor sort of stupid thing to ask but appreciate the feedback.

Edit: my reply to them.

&#x200B;

Edit2: Since this has got a lot of attention there's a couple things I'd like to clarify:

The service was prepaid and I decided time and date. I've used their services before and booked 6hours, this time the situation wasn't nearly as bad and I thought 7hr15min would suffice. Which it did IMO, the cleaner wasn't perfect but was never expected to me. I think he did a great job, solid 9/10. I'm perfectly fine with the cost as it was exactly what I decided to pay for. 0 complains about that or the cleaners work.

&#x200B;

There were no biohazards ( condoms, roaches, bedbugs, rotten food, broken glass etc ) or anything like that. More like empty snuscans, beercases, pizzaboxes, clothes etc. Imagine a teenagers dirty room when mom yells to him for the 5th time to clean your shit. That was my appartment."
"AITA for contemplating reporting my neighbor to the HOA rather than speaking to them directly? | I own a home in a suburban neighborhood. There are a wide range of people in said neighborhood. Some young like myself, some retirees, and a good amount in the middle. Along with that, there are some people who take great pride in maintaining their house and property.  I consider myself one of those people. At the other end of the spectrum, there are people in this neighborhood that treat their house like a dumping ground. My neighbors across the street are those people. 

To put it lightly, they are rough looking hillbillies. Hillbillies that have somehow ended up in the suburbs.  I believe it’s an older mother that is playing host to her adult son, his gf, and I believe a sister but she’s not around all the time.  I have tried to be neighborly and wave at them or say hi whenever I see them, but they never return the gesture. We are basically strangers.

My problem with them is the disarray they leave the exterior of their house in. There are usually piles of garbage, old appliances, dilapidated pieces of furniture, etc etc piled up in front of their garage door or roadside. For example, they have had a broken dresser on the curb for almost an entire month now.

I have no problem confronting people, however based on their actions and appearance, I would assume they wouldn’t take kindly to me knocking on their door and asking them to clean up their property. And I know I wouldn’t take kindly to them retaliating to me asking said question.  I predict it would cause problems for months or years to come.

So....AITA for thinking about skipping the possible confrontation and just reporting them? Bear in mind also, this HOA hasn’t shown that they’re very committed to upholding their duties. There are a lot of houses like this scattered all over the neighborhood that have been that way for months, so the HOA clearly isn’t giving them notices or fining them.  This particular house just happens to be the one I have to look at all the time, hence my issue with them specifically."
"AITA for refusing to FaceTime? | I’ve been friends with Kelly for 5 years. She was a mentor to me when I was a kid, and we became close when I was in college and then getting into my first job. She’s about 9 years older than me. We talked regularly on Marco Polo, as I traveled a lot for work and she is a stay at home mom to 4 kids, so we could send videos back and forth as we went about our days. 

I started a new job 4 months ago and moved across the country. I’m in an office now, so I don’t spend as much time on Marco Polo. I also have been trying not to be too wrapped up in my technology/social media because I want to be living life and creating new habits. When I explained this to her at first, she said she didn’t believe that was my reason and would call me (3-4 times a day if I didn’t answer, usually when I was at work and couldn’t talk - this happened multiple days in a row). She’d then Marco Polo me and ask if my boyfriend and I had broken up, if something had happened, asking why I was being this way. I explained again, it’s not you, it’s not personal, I’m just trying not to be so attached to my devices. She told me a few days later when she left a voicemail at 9:30 a.m. that if she didn’t hear from me in a few hours she would call the sheriff’s office in my town because she was worried about me. I replied a little bit later and said under no circumstances should she ever do that — if she’s truly ever concerned, maybe reach out to my mom and ask her first. Then she started FaceTiming me. 

The first time she FaceTimed me, I did not pick up. I sent her a Marco Polo a few hours later and told her I do not use FaceTime. I don’t like that other people can call me randomly and I have to be video ready to talk to them. I politely asked her to not FaceTime me. Send me a Marco Polo if you want to video chat and I’ll get back to you. She said “I know you used FaceTime with your mom & dad and your boyfriend when you got your new dog, you told me so.” Yes, that was literally the FIRST time I had used it. I very rarely use it with my BF because we are long distance and yeah, we like to see each other’s faces. I was annoyed that she was trying to throw a lie in my face that I had never even claimed?

It’s been about 3 months since all this. In that time, she’s FaceTimed me a dozen times and I have never once picked up. I feel like, I told her not to FT multiple times bc I don’t like it, that should be enough of an explanation. I have started replying a little faster to Marco Polos, but not immediately. She left me a text last night saying “are you okay? are you mad at me?” because she FT me when I was already in bed, and I didn’t reply. 

AITA for ignoring her like this? I know she is lonely, but I feel like my boundaries deserve respect too. She can always message or Marco Polo me. I just don’t like phone calls or FT out of the blue when it’s not urgent (and she has friends/family who aren’t 1500 miles from her who could help if it was urgent). I don’t want to be a bad friend, I just don’t know the right way to handle it."
"AITA for not wanting to share a hobby with my friend? | Background: both my friend, Lisa (23F) and I (22F) are somewhat artistic, at first it was fun, but lately it feels as though everything is a competition sometimes, as if she wants to ""one up"" me, if I talk about buying a drawing tablet, Lisa suddenly decides she wants one as well and beats me to it, if I start painting watercolor, Lisa decides that's her new paint of choice as well, Lisa could go months without making art but as soon as I make something and post it on social media, Lisa immediately starts working on a new project so she can upload similar new art to social media as well, etc. it's gotten to the point where I don't even want to mention anything I'm doing art-wise because I'm afraid Lisa will copy me or ""one-up"" me.


It doesn't help that Lisa never seems to be enthusiastic of my art anyway, she'll never re-post it or compliment it, and if anyone mentions it she'll say something akin to ""oh..that's nice""


Recently, I've gotten into making custom cosplays/ cosplay accessories you normally couldn't find online, and Lisa now decides she would also like to make cosplays and sell them as well, great, except for the fact that we share almost 80% of our friends on social media, and I'm the only one who does this sort of thing right now. I take a lot of pride in my work and I wouldn't really appreciate the competition, so I wasn't sure how to react when Lisa told us (me and a couple other friends) but she could tell in my tone that I was not enthusiastic of the idea.


If Lisa wanted to practice making cosplays on her own, sure, that would fine, a lot of people do, but the fact that she also wants to sell them is what bothers me, especially considering that she doesn't even need the money, her parents pay her rent, car, school, etc. makes A LOT on unemployment right now, etc. I feel like she only took an interest in this whole thing because she sees me doing well in it, when there's a million other things she could be doing/selling.


I know this might sound trivial and maybe even childish and conceited, but am I the asshole for not supporting Lisa's potential side business? I have no idea how to tell her what I'm feeling or even IF I should tell her. I have plenty of other artistic friends as well but they seem to do things at their own pace so I never felt this way about them, I feel childish even complaining about this and petty for not being happy for her when she told me but I'm not sure what to do."
"WIBTA if I tell my boyfriend I want to spend Christmas alone at home rather than with his family? | I cut ties with my family about 2 months ago. I was doing fine at first but eventually a lot of mixed feelings started appearing.

It is really painful cutting ties with your family and the way it happened was not smooth of course. It feels like they all suddenly died. 

My boyfriend doesn’t know that I have been feeling extremely down. He thinks I am fine when in reality I’m really not.

I can’t even hear the word “mom” without feeling uneasy. Even though she damaged me a lot I still miss her a lot and love her. We just couldn’t function together. I know that separating from that environment that almost killed me was the right choice, but it is still really hard to go through the feelings of disconnecting from your family.

Christmas comes around and this is the first time I won’t spend Christmas with my family, which was usually not a bad experience back at my aunt’s house. I spent thanksgiving with my boyfriend’s family, and although his family is amazing, I felt anxious the whole day. 

I just kept wanting to tear up.

Since I woke up today in Christmas Eve I been feeling very nauseous and nervous. My hands won’t stop shaking and I start crying out of nowhere.

I just don’t know if I’ll be able to go through 2 days acting like I’m okay when I know I am not. I would rather stay home alone.

But my boyfriend has been putting a lot of effort into our apartment and has been helping me a lot economically and mentally to what he understands, so I feel like an asshole asking for that. 

So WIBTA if I asked to stay home?

Edit- I also wanted to be clear- because of past experiences it is really hard to communicate when I’m not feeling well. It is something I have been working on with my boyfriend and he is aware of that. It isn’t like I expect him to know everything. It’s just something I have struggled with (from issues with my family)."
"AITA Making my vegetarian daughter make her own meals | Title basically sums it up I guess.

Daughter has decided she wants to be a vegetarian. I love meat and it’s very rare for me to go without some kind of meat at dinner. 

My daughter naturally expects me to accommodate and cook vegetarian options for dinner too. I told her that if she wants to be vegetarian she can make her own dinner.

Wife told me I should cook veggie dinners for her, but shut up quickly after I asked if she wanted to start cooking dinner instead.

Naturally I am now the asshole in all of this.

AITA?

Edit: daughter is 17"
"AITA for not offering my Friends And Family discount to my friend? | I work at a hotel that is part of a large, multinational hotel company. This company gives us a certain number of discounted nights for employees and a certain number of nights for Friends and Family. 

F&F discounts are usually 25% to 50% off regular rate. They are usually a very good deal for the type of hotels (mostly mid-range, extended stay, or higher end), but lower-tier hotel chains or motels may be cheaper (and a bargain shopper who only cares about price can almost always find a cheaper room at one of those lower-tier chains.)

A friend of mine was traveling from the Pacific NW to Ohio for a funeral in the family. Due to physical issues that would make sitting in an airplane seat for hours be extremely painful, he was going to drive so he could take frequent breaks.

Before he left, we were hanging out and talking about the trip, and he kept dropping obvious hints that he wanted to use my discount for hotels along the way. But he would not come straight out and ask. He would say things like, ""I'm not sure what all I'm going to do. There might be nights I have to sleep in my van if I can't find a cheap hotel."" He is on a fixed income, and paying for the trip had been a concern for him.

I sympathized with him, but didn't say much about it. Enough to show I was listening and move the conversation forward. Over the course of the evening, he brought this up several times and made several hints. I would not have minded him using my discount, but I felt (and still do) that he should've asked, not just drop overly dramatic, obvious hints.

When he came back from his trip, and we were hanging out again, he brought it back up, got angry, and yelled at me for not offering him the use of my F&F discount. He said I should have picked up on his hints and offered the discount, that's what friends do, and I have issues picking up on social cues that I need to work on. (Note: I do have social issues, including picking up on cues or second guessing cues. My friend knows this. But this was not the reason I didn't offer.)

He called me an asshole and basically accused me of being a bad friend. I told him what I said here: I feel a person should ask to use a discount, not just passive-aggressivly hint at it. He said he doesn't feel comfortable asking people for discounts and stuff like that, and I should have offered after he mentioned he might sleep in his van.

Every other friend of mine, and family members, will ask to use my discount when they need it. If it's available, I help them book their dates. My friend knows this. 

I would have helped him with the discount if he asked, but him just dropping hints made me feel like he was trying to manipulate it out of me, and I didn't like that. 

We have barely talked since this last argument, and the way he came at me about it (along with other things) has made me reconsider my friendship with him. So, AITA for not offering the discount, instead of playing dumb and waiting for him to ask?

Edit:
Regarding the financial aspect of this and how the discount works. The discount is per night, with a certain number of nights per year total. The discount is different at every hotel, depending on a number of factors such as location, brand, regular rate, etc. This is why it can range from 25-50%. When a hotel gets to a certain occupancy percentage, the discounted rate becomes unavailable and cannot be booked, but existing reservations at the rate are of course honored. This is why I cannot guarantee the discount will be available.

As to the financial circumstances, yes, he was worried about it. But I have explained how the discount works to my friend when I previously let him know I'd be willing to let him use it if he let me know he wanted to. He knew it wasn't always available and he knew it wasn't always the cheapest. If price was the only factor for him, I know for a fact there were cheaper options he could have stayed at. They would not have been as nice of a hotel, but also not a sleazy, dirty horrible place either. Him hinting at having to sleep in his car struck me as emotional manipulation, and that is what I objected to so much."
"AITA for rejecting men shorter than me? | So recently I've joined good old tinder looking for love and have been chatting to a few guys. Theres one guy I'm talking to who seems cool but from his profile I have no idea how tall he is, so I just ask him. He gets all weird and cagey and lets me know he's 5'9. I sent back something like 'ah rip I'm 6ft' and he replies back 'so?'. I then kinda told him I just didn't really want to date anyone shorter than me and he launched into how I'm a horrible shallow person and I'm like every other girl wanting a guy that is at least 6ft. Not going to lie his rant kinda shook me a bit. 

&#x200B;

Like maybe it is shallow but god damn I just want to feel like a female for once and feel small and protected. I feel like bloody Sasquatch with all my friends who are like 5'2.

"WIBTA for wearing a hijab as an athiest? | I live in a very religiously diverse but uniethnic country. I'm specifically from a village of only 3200 and my high school is very small with 250 students total. On the positive it's a highly casual atmosphere, on the negative classes are very limited. 

If we want certain classes (like career programs) we have to commute during the school day to larger cities for that. I'm in a program for early childhood education at a large school (3200 students - same amount of students in that school than people that live in my village) in the closest city. The problem is, that school is incredibly strict. 

The uniform is very lenient at my home high school, but the city high schools uniform is very specific. It was determined us part-time students will be excluded from full uniform as long as we abide by a strict formal dress code. 

I want to get my hair dyed a ""loud"" color. My home schools head teacher confirmed this would be no problem here, but the assistant head teacher at the other school said I wouldn't be allowed to participate in any classes there if any unnatural hair color was showing. I've been considering wearing a hijab during my trips to the other school, but some peoole (ironically non-muslims) have noted that would be insensitive and would make me an asshole. 

WIBTA for wearing a hijab as an athiest to conceal dyed hair?

"AITA for telling the truth | So after waiting a substantial amount of time for my lady friend to get dressed. She walks down the steps and ask me ""Does this dress make me look fat?"" It was a sleeveless dress she had back fat/meat hanging over the sides. Similar to a small flying squirrel's wings. I mention the ""overflow"" and asked if she was going to wear a sweater or shawl? She replied ""No why would I? Are you saying that I look fat?"" I said ""You're not fat. That dress makes you look fat because the way it fits"". She was livid and told me she didn't feel like going out anymore and to lock the door behind me once I leave."
"AITA if I spoke with an employee's therapist? | As usual, hear me out.

I had an employee, we'll call her Sarah for story purposes.  Sarah came into the job through a reference, and was absolutely a good employee for the first 3 years we had her.  But Sarah is a former addict, and has been through rehab many times.  About a year ago, Sarah's best friend died from an overdose, and Sarah herself relapsed into drugs.  She eventually got caught and ended up stealing from our store and was subsequently fired for this.

I advocated (as a manager) for bringing Sarah back a few months later, as long as Sarah didn't have access to any money.  My boss agreed, on the condition that Sarah see a therapist regularly, and brought Sarah back.  It's been a whirlwind of a ride, and Sarah has done some shady things on her reemployment, including more potential stealing as well as vague depression induced thoughts.

Sarah has actively told me who her therapist is, and the therapist is a regular customer (I've known them about 6 years).  I know the therapist is bound by certain confidentiality laws, but WIBTA if I asked if they had about 3 minutes during their lunch break in which I could discuss some of the troubling things Sarah has said to me out of concern?

Edit: I absolutely did not make this clear, and I'm sorry.  Sarah told me and my other managers that she was seeing this specific doctor and we were free to contact Doctor anytime we wanted to corroborate her stories (she's a great liar).  I know that Doctor can't corroborate anything, unless they happen in their sessions.  I am only trying to give Doctor some info I think Doctor needs.

Edit #2:  Thanks for all the responses.  I've read through all of them, and have gotten some good ideas on how to go about addressing this issue, as well as insight on determining if I even need to address this, and have gotten some great perspective from both sides of the situation.  I am not sure what I will do going forward, but whatever happens every response has helped me really evaluate how to best help Sarah and what may be overstepping boundaries."
"AITA for telling a coworker that the office is NOT a daycare center? | I work for a local government office, in a large complex with a whole lot of people. When their kids are sick or when they don't have a sitter for their kids, they take the day off from the substantial leave that we're allowed per year. My entitled coworker feels that when she doesn't have a sitter, it's perfectly fine to just bring her 5 year old in with her for the entire day. The kid ""camps out"" under this coworkers desk, laying on the floor, being constantly told to ""Ssssh"" and left to amuse herself with an ipad and toys. This coworker also does not ask our supervisor beforehand if it's alright to do this, she just brings the kid in. 

Also, when she has her kid here, numerous people come over to our office to chat and coddle the kid and ""meet"" the kid and baby talk the kid and it's really disturbing when you're trying to concentrate on writing or creating graphics for a project. 

This morning, I heard her come in and she told her kid to say hi to me. Coworkers says she didn't have a sitter today. I said, ""you mean she's here all day again?"" She said yes. I asked if she asked our supervisor if it was okay. She said, ""No, he'll know when he gets here."" I told her that the office is NOT A DAYCARE center and she should use the leave she has to stay home and watch her kid.
All day she's been whispering to people about how I'm an asshole to telling her this and how I don't like kids. I love kids. Just not in the office all damn day! Am I the Asshole here?"
"AITA For thinking that my wife spending money on app micro-transactions is a waste of money? | So basically the title says it all. But my wife has played a couple different games on her phone and usually they are puzzle games where you get so far and then they don't let you proceed unless you wait or pay for ""gems"" or whatever.

So I have brought it up to her before that I think it's a scam and a waste of money to be spending money on these items that are basically just throwing away money it my eyes. Don't get me wrong we can afford it, but I am anti micro-transactions because of what games have done like Star wars battlefront from EA. I go out of my way to not spend money on useless items that maybe I will enjoy but I realize it's just throwing away money so I don't. Such as weapon skins or buying characters for games like Rainbow Six Siege with real money.

**(Edit: I do not spend money on micro transactions at all. People are getting confused thinking I spent money on Star wars. I was giving that as an example as something I do not spend money on that I think is wasteful.)**

&#x200B;

Usually when I have brought it up she gets irritable because her argument is we can afford it and she works too so what difference does it make if she wants to spend money on it. Which I understand, she works as well. However I didn't think she would spend too much money on the game.

So I get an email every time she spends money on the game because we are using my paypal. I looked at our account history and she has spend $30 on the game just this month. Which to me is insane. If she continues on this track she will have spent $60 on useless currency for a mobile game. I could buy an entire game or several on pretty much any platform including mobile for less than that and never spend money on it again.

I am considering bringing it up, but I don't want to be the asshole.. Should I not let it bother me? am I being unreasonable?

&#x200B;

**(Edit: So here's the consensus. I am an asshole for being controlling on what she spends money on. I agree. that's wrong and I shouldn't do anything like that. Being concerned about finances and overspending is reasonable though so I will probably propose a budget and we can discuss what's fair. and She will perhaps have a happy medium or another idea. We shall see. Thank you everyone for all the help!)**

**Edit: I've realized I'm a major asshole. Sorry.**"
"AITA for making noise in my room past a certain time? | I'm a college student and live in a dorm. On days where i can sleep in I do  but i was raised to not lay in bed all day unless you're sick. So I begin to do work on my computer and sometimes I need to watch videos. My roommate however sleeps until 2 or later in the afternoon. Usually I just leave and go in the lobby so I can be as reasonably loud I want but sometimes i like to just be in my room. So on days i stay in my room i think i'm not in the wrong for listening to my stuff out loud after 12 pm. It's not super loud, it' s just loud enough where i can hear it out loud but it's not obnoxious. I even walk around the room to make sure it's not loud across the room. One day she left me a note on my bed saying to keep it down but I figured to expect someone to stay completely silent until you decide to wake up is unreasonable especially if it's well into the afternoon. Am I the asshole for thinking this way?

&#x200B;

Edit: Why I don't use headphones

We both said in the beginning of the year when we first became roommates that as long as it isn't too loud we could listen to our things out loud. We both listen to our stuff out loud as long as it doesn't interfere with whatever the others listening to. But s I guess she's changed her opinion  now that shes suddenly annoyed by it but didn't tell me.

&#x200B;

Edit #2

Also, I posted somewhat because i thought it was hypocritical to ask me to turn my things down in the morning but when she wakes up she listens to things on her phone at max volume. We have talked about this and it fixes it for a few days but then it's back to square one."
"AITA for not playing along with my daughter who identifies as a mythical creature? | TLDR: My 15 year old daughter says she is a creature that she found by watching/reading Harry Potter. I've banned all Harry Potter related material and have canceled a planned family trip to Universal Studios . My daughter is having a meltdown in response but I'm not budging. Am I the asshole?

My family moves a lot due to my husband being in the military. My daughter's mainstay friends are mostly online but recently she's got into a new crowd at school who are... unusual to say the least. I try to encourage in person relationships so I've kept my mouth shut about their behaviour and have even been chauffeuring them to whatever they have planned for the day as well as giving them all pocket change for whatever catches their eye when they're out and about. I want my daughter happy.

One of these new friends has gotten my daughter hooked on Harry Potter which in itself isn't a bad thing. I was so happy she had found something new that excited her that my husband and I were planning on taking her and the friend to the Wizarding World for her birthday. I love when any of my family members branch out and try new things and I wanted to encourage the new interests she was developing. When we announced this to get things started to get weird.

All of a sudden she was wearing only black, her headbands with a unicorn horn, and wasn't changing her clothes at night. She would go to bed in shoes in all if I didn't stop to catch her at night. She has her own debit card that is connected to a bank account that she puts her money in. She used it to buy a pair of shoes that look like hooves. She tried to wear them to school but I managed to convince her that her feet would hurt too much so they've been blessedly sitting in her closet. My husband laughed it off as a phase but I was worried. Then she started answering questions in noises best described as ""person who has only been vaguely described what a donkey is tries to recreate noise"". She even used to play a game with her online friends every Wednesday but now she's not talking to any of them at all. She told me that they were being mean to her but I've never seen them even argue about little things so I don't know how much truth is there. I hated being around her and I hated myself for feeling that way. She didn't feel like my daughter at that point. I felt like she was trying to impersonate her new friends instead of just impressing them. Does that make sense?

Finally she pulls us aside one day and tells us that she didn't feel she is who she was born as and I think ""Okay! That explains so much. She wants to transition to a boy. We can start that and go through all of these bumpy patches as a family"" But no! She tells us that she's some mythical creature from Harry Potter. I exploded which wasn't appropriate for me to do, I admit that, but I stand by everything else. I told her she wasn't allowed to go watch the new movie, read the books, or watch the old films anymore. We took out everything Harry Potter from her room and I canceled the trip we had planned. My husband thought I had overreacted but he stands by me.

My daughter has completely gone off the rails. She's always been a good kid with a fairly even temper. Now she's yelling at us over every little thing, constantly tells us off, and is just plain miserable to be around. She told me I've stripped away her identity but I feel like I'm saving her from developing any social issues later down the line.

Am I the asshole for thinking that she needs to distance herself from something that has reached the point of pure obsession?"
"AITA for making my roommate replace my Apple TV? | A few weeks ago, my roommate and her boyfriend (Pat and Ian) stayed in a hotel (2/28-3/1) together and Pat asked if she can borrow my Apple TV. I agreed. When she came back, she never took the Apple TV out of her bag and set it back up. On the 12th I bought a new Apple TV. I had been looking at getting a new one for quite a while since the one I had let her borrow was a old and started to slow down. It was also a loaner from my sister and I wanted to get a new one and return it to her. I came home with the new one and Pat told me that it was good that I had a new one because she lost mine (I found out later that day that she had just left it at the hotel and had them hold it for her, only needing to pick it up). I was pretty upset at her at that point because not only had she waited over a week to tell me, but she also hadn’t gone to pick it up during that time either. She told me she was busy and couldn’t get it and I relented since she had been working long shifts at work. I informed her that night after she had left to hang out with Ian that I wanted her to pick it up before she came home. I got a text from Ian asking if I could drop it until the next day because she wasn’t in a good head space. I told him I’m pretty pissed but I’ll wait to mention it again. He said thanks and that was that. The next day (13th) came and I reminded her that she needs to pick it up. We talked about her work schedule and I told her she needed to get it on Saturday (14th) since that was her day off. I went to work and when I went on my lunch, she showed up with chocolate and said she would buy me food. I found out that this was her way of telling me she called and the hotel lost the Apple TV (she called the night before and had a breakdown in Ian’s car, hence the text from him). She told me that she wasn’t planning on replacing it, instead buying me food and games to make it up. I said that wasn’t okay and she needed to replace it. To save both our asses, I said I wouldn’t tell my sister what happened as long as she buys a replacement ASAP. She agreed. I messaged Ian later that night and told him how pissed off I was about this whole situation. I also mentioned that they treat me like shit (invite me out just to third wheel, talk shit about me over the phone with me in the same room, etc) and I’m tired of it. I told him I wanted a replacement ordered ASAP and I expressed my frustration to him because I took her into my household after she was kicked out of her house and I get this in return. Ian got really upset with me and said i’m materialistic and prioritizing an Apple TV over my friend and told me she spent all the money she had in her bank account on this (she gets paid more than I do, all her money goes to her credit card). He said he doesn’t want anything to do with me. I told him it wasnt my fault she cant afford and if she can’t afford to replace it, she shouldn’t have lost it. Am i the asshole here?"
"AITA for making sure that my son was celebrated alongside his teacher? |   

We just moved to a new district before the start of the school year. My son (8) has had a hard time adjusting and we’ve been doing all we can to help. One thing he really likes about the school is you can bring in (allergy free) treats on your birthday to celebrate with the class at snack time. It’s something he’s looked forward to for months.

Then we found out that he shares a birthday with his teacher. One of the students had gone to her mom and suggested they take the time to throw her a party the day of. We got a letter sent home from the room parents about sending in money to chip in for a cake and other goodies.  I reached out to the mom in charge and said “Hey, it’s my son’s birthday as well, do you think you could include his name along with the teacher’s? He’s really been looking forward to celebrate his birthday in class.”

I got a response saying “No, this is for the teacher. Your son can bring in his own separate treats.”

Here’s the thing, I know parents won’t want their kids having double the amounts of sugar. I could bring in fruit or something, but my son has been looking forward to having cake or cupcakes with the class. I reached out again and said “You really can’t see how this would hurt a little kid?” and she said that they wanted to celebrate the teacher, it wasn’t her fault that it landed on the same day as my son’s.

I knew that this wasn’t the teacher’s problem, so I went to vice principal and reported it. I said I know it’s silly, but it means a great deal to my son and if everyone’s celebrating the teacher and not him, he’ll be upset. The vice principal agreed that an adult birthday party should not come before a child’s and told the room parents either they put both names on the cake or there would be no party at all. The room parents complied.

Day of I go in to assist with the party and sure enough, both names are on there, but parents are whispering about me. The teacher and my son both get sang to and everything’s fine, so I didn’t get why it was such a big deal. However, now it’s clear I’m the most hated parent.

Was I an ass for this?"
"AITA for offering my girlfriend food? | My(39M) girlfriend(32F) is bulimic and has been since she was a teenager. She’s always on a diet, but lately she’s making an extra effort to lose weight and is on a strict diet. She religiously tracks her caloric intake, weighing everything. She has asked me not to talk about food or offer her anything to eat. The other day I brought home a wrap for us to share from Tim Hortons. She ate half and proceeded to spend the rest of the night eating a bunch of food then vomiting. Afterwards she asked me to stop offering her food because it’s ruining her diet. Tonight I made a rice pilaf dish when I came home from work and offered her some. She ate it and then she ended up eating a bunch of food out of the cupboards and fridge then locked herself in the bathroom for an hour with the water running. When she came out she asked me to stop offering her food, because she counts her calories and pre-plans exactly what she’s going to eat. She can’t say no when someone offers her food. If she goes over her calories for the day it makes her feel like she might as well binge, then she feels bad and vomits. She said she feels like I’m the only one standing between her and her goals. I feel like she’s blaming me for her inability to have self control. I’m going to try to remember to stop offering her food but I can’t make any promises. Am I the asshole for offering her food?

EDIT:
I know she needs help and she has gone to doctors in the past. She says that she doesn’t get taken seriously by doctors because she’s a normal weight, and she thinks losing weight will make medical professionals will take her seriously."
"AITA for wanting my sweater back? | There is a person in my friend group (I'll refer to her as ""F"") that I always thought was a little off. She's so sweet that its almost too much- it feels like she's only being nice to get something, if that makes sense? She always rubbed me the wrong way but since we have mutual friends, we have been ""friends"" for quite some time. I've also never mentioned my dislike for her to anyone else, and was always pleasant to her, up until this incident.

F once mentioned to me that it would be cute for us to get matching outfits. I found a shirt that I thought she would like, so I bought us both one. It was a cute but relatively plain white top with some lacing on the bottom that I thought would be a nice top for either of us to wear to work. Wasn't expensive, but wasn't cheap either. At the time, we were living far apart, so I mailed it to her with a card, explaining how I had one and we could match from far away blah blah blah. Didn't hear anything back about it.

Fast forward a few months, and we are both staying the weekend at a mutual friend's place to celebrate their birthday. We were going out to dinner for said friend, and all trying on various outfits we had packed, as girls do when deciding what to wear out. One outfit I tried on included this nice sweater I had (I think about $120). I decided not to wear said sweater, but it caught F's eye. She asked me if I wanted to play a game, and trade my sweater for a ""super secret"" item she had. She was REALLY excited and enthusiastic about it, and I didn't want to cause a scene (especially since it was my other friends birthday and I didn't want to do anything that would upset her/take the focus off of her). A part of me also didn't want to upset F, since everyone else likes her, and honestly didn't want to get on her bad side, so I agreed.

Hopefully you can see where this is going. The ""super secret"" item was the shirt that I had gifted F, thinking that she wanted to match with me. So I traded my expensive sweater for a shirt that not only had I gifted her and also paid for, but that I already owned! I was being ""re-gifted"" my own gift!

Initially, I didn't want to say anything to save her the embarrassment.. So, I let it go until the next week. I was unable to confront F in person, and she never seemed to be available for a phone call, so I had to text her. I explained that the shirt she ""traded"" me was actually one that I had given to her, and that I would like my sweater back. She denied it and said that she bought the shirt herself, and that its too late and she wont be giving my sweater back.

After a couple too many glasses of wine, I just unleashed years of pent up emotion. I called her fake, a liar, manipulator, and a few choice words. She ended up blocking me and we haven't spoken since. It has also really isolated me from my friend group, as most of them agree with her, and think that I should apologize for being mean.

So, AITA?"
"AITA for leaving my baby unattended while I go to the gym? | For disclaimer: I live in a main floor apartment and gym is right next door. From my patio door it's 30 second walk to the gym. I bring baby monitor and it still works that distance. 

I go to the gym for hour a night and have my daughter (9mo old) three day a week. I only go to the gym when she's asleep. I've only been doing this for month and not once have she woken up while I was gone.

AITA? FWIW I grew up in Switzerland before moving to Canada and leaving children unattended at home is somewhat common, not quite a social faux-pas as it is here. My ex-wife thinks this is the worst thing I can do to the child which I'm don't agree with.

Sorry for my poor English."
"AITA for taking two paid weeks vacation in a year as an in home daycare provider? | I started doing in home daycare last June and I didn’t take any vacation time between then and now. I put out a new contract which listed the dates I plan to be closed for 2020. Major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas and then two weeks off for vacation, not taken together, one in May for my sisters wedding and one at the end of August for a family vacation. I give my families one week in which their children are not at daycare that they do not have to pay, that can be their vacation or it can be used during one of mine. I have asked to be paid for every week during the year, except their one free week. 
I have a very upset father that thinks it’s “ridiculous” for me to have paid time off like that. AITA of expecting some paid time off when I work 5 days a week 12+ hrs a day?

I don’t suppose that it matters that I only charge $100-125 a week and I don’t keep track of hours. I’m open 7:30-5:30 and I have a lot of children all 66 hours and charge them no more for this."
"AITA for raising a complaint with a bar that threw away my ecig? | So I had a couple of drinks with some friends at a restaurant/bar last night and accidentally left my e cigarette on my table, I came back for it not even 5 minutes later only for one of the staff members to tell me that she had thrown it away.
I take responsibility for forgetting it, but I find it quite irresponsible of staff just to throw away someone else's property without entertaining the notion of keeping it in case the owner comes back for it. Especially since the e cigarette wasn't cheap either, I felt I should raise it with whoever is in charge. 
I don't want to get the girl in trouble, but at the same time she didn't even seem bothered that she had thrown it away and didn't even apologise. We were the only people in the bar (slow night, I guess) so its not even a defence to say they were crazy busy and she had to get that table cleared for another customer.
Maybe I'm over reacting, it just put a downer on the night since it was basically £50 just being thrown away with no apology or empathy at all."
"WIBTA for giving my 17 year old his first beer without my wife knowing? | Okay, context. My son is 17, completely responsible, and a good kid. Never gets in trouble, doesn't have any bad habits or anything else that would make me worry. We have a pretty close relationship, too.

Next week, I'm taking a couple days vacation, and he and I are going fishing one of the days. I was about his age, maybe a little older, when my Dad let me have a beer with him, and it is still something I remember. I asked him if he'd like to try his first beer with me while fishing, and he said yes. I said ""Don't tell Mom"", and he agreed. 

We're still married, still are best friends and really enjoy each other. However, I know she would tell me no if I asked if I could have a beer with him, because I know her.

WIBTA if I dont ask her and give him his first beer anyways, in a father-son moment?

Edit: it will literally be ONE beer, and we're not a family of heavy drinkers. I bought a 6-pack 2 weeks ago and still have 4. My heavy benders are when I have 2 wine coolers in a single afternoon. It's just one beer, and I'd eventually tell my wife, but I thought having it between us would make it a little more special."
"AITA for not honoring my son's punishment? | Update 2: I told my ex to cancel her vacation as my son will not be going because it affects my custody time. Yes, I told her it was okay but after her husband's stunt of saying he couldn't do the sleepover which was on my day anyways, I had to crack the whip. Let those two eat each other alive. They deserve each other.

Update 1: This HILARIOUS. My son's best friend mom emailed us an invite for a sleepover which is on my DAY. I was going to see if my son wanted to go, but my ex's husband said my son could not go as he was grounded. I can react in so many ways...


His mom and I are divorced and don't have much of a relationship. Cordial, but indifferent. Our son is now 11 and my ex remarried a few years ago but she was with the guy for some time.

We have 50/50. She requested that she have him for two weeks for vacation. I agreed even though this ate into my time with him. Apparently, he got into it with step dad and he got grounded for a week. Well, most of that week is my week with him before he leaves for vacation with them and she asked me to see to it that his grounding continues through my time. I won't see him for three weeks. I am not saying not to punish him. 

Punish him when he's on their time. 

I have no problems with him when he's with me.

I refused.

I already made plans to make most if the days that I have him and I'm sure as hell am not going to cancel those plans because he mouthed off to step-dad. I don't care much for step-dad anyways. What I do with my son on my time is my business and vice-versa. 

Also, I don't want to set precedent where I am the parent who has to do both sides of discipline.


Edit: Update: My son called him a ""freaking asshole."" My ex calls him the same thing when they fight. Her words, not mine. He learned it from her, not me. I don't open share my dislike for her husband. Maybe an eyeroll, but I'm too corporate and professional to do it in front of my son."
"AITA for making my daughter clean the bathrooms with her toothbrush as a punishment? | My daughter Brittany got detention today. Apparently, she and her friends were talking about careers and she said something like “imagine being something like a plumber or a custodian”. They then went on to mock those with those professions and specifically, Brittany said “wow, I would rather be dead then pick up garbage and shit all day”. Her classmate overheard them and reported all of them to the teacher because she was offended (her dad works as a plumber).

Her teacher made her apologize to her but to go one step further, I wanted humble her. I made her clean all the bathrooms with a toothbrush (obviously bought her a new one afterwards). It took about 5 hours total and afterwards, we had a talk about respect and how it’s disrespectful to mock any profession, no matter what it is. I thought I’d done a pretty good job at disciplining her, but my wife came home (she works 15 hour shifts 3 days a week, so doesn’t get home until very late Tuesday-Thursday). She was very angry and thought the punishment was way too far. I disagreed; she acted like a brat who believed certain professions were beneath her, and I wanted to humble her.

We normally agree almost 100% regarding punishments, so I didn’t even think to ask her (which she does the same for me whenever she’s disciplining our children). AITA for the way I went about punishing her?

Edit: I appreciate the discussion guys! I just wanted to add that I thought of a toothbrush and not normal cleaning supplies, because that would've taken an hour max, and she already cleans as apart of her daily chores. Telling her to do her normal chores as a punishment doesn't seem like a that big a punishment. Just wanted to put this here because a lot of comments are asking ""why a toothbrush?"""
"AITA for yelling at a women who wouldn't give my dad the fat from her steak? | Okay, so this happened last night and I'm still angry about it but my wife says I'm out of line.

Last night we went out to eat for my dad's 60 birthday. There were 6 of us and we went to one of those Japanese steakhouses with the hibachi table. Those tables seat 8 people, and it was pretty busy so we assumed another couple would be joining us. We end up at a table with a seemingly nice older couple. We make some small talk and all order our food.

When the chef comes out and starts to cook, my dad notices the chef is cutting the fat off of the steak and throwing it away. My dad nicely asked if he could just cook up the fat for him instead of throwing it away. (My dad LOVES the fat more than the steak itself). The chef cheerfully agrees and starts gathering the fat from all of the steaks to cook in a separate pile for him.

The women sitting at our table told the chef ""I don't want him to have the fat from my steak!"".

The chef was apologetic and said he didn't know she wanted the fat too and he will split it between them. The women assured him she didn't want any of the fat, she just didn't want him to have something that was hers.

This is when I spoke up and asked her why this was an issue. She replied saying that it was her fat and she could do what she pleased with it.

I told her it was pretty selfish to throw it away just so someone else couldn't have it. She furthered her argument by saying that she didn't want his hands all over her food, which made even less sense because it wouldn't be touching her plate at all.

We went back and forth a little bit before I gave up and told the chef to throw her portion away and just give my dad the rest, not before I called her out again for being selfish though.

This all ruined the entire evening for my family and for theirs. My wife is blaming me because I shouldn't have tried to take another person's food. Which I understand, to an extent. But she was just wasting it for the sake of not letting my dad have it. So, AITA for calling this woman out and wanting her to give my dad the fat from her steak?

EDIT: I know my title says I yelled at her, but I just used ""yelling"" more as a catch all for confronting her. My tone was super seasy going and chill the whole time. But my choice of words weren't the nicest.

Also, my dad was on my side and not embarrassed or anything if that helps. He is battling stage IV colorectal cancer right now and he said this stupid argument made his week. No blaming dad, please. He did nothing wrong and didn't ask for anyone elses fat, just his own

I'm honestly surprised by how polarizing these opinions are. But I'll come to the consesus that we all suck here (but I'll stick to my guns and say mostly her)"
"AITA For Effectively Ruining My Sisters Life Because Of What She Did | So, I’ve (F20) had a boyfriend, let’s call him John, John (M20) and i started dating when we were 17. I have a big family, I have my mom (F53) my dad (M55) my older twin sisters that are 34, and my younger sister (F19). My sisters both have husbands and kids and my younger sister lives at home and works for the family business. I live in a condo with boyfriend. He’s always been close with my family. Around 2 weeks ago i was ordering post mates on my boyfriends phone and he got a message from my younger sister. I was feeling nosy and opened up their message thread. For 2 months they’ve been hooking up and sending nudes. In that moment i flipped out and took screenshots, i sent them to myself and deleted the evidence. I acted like nothing happened and luckily the next day John was gonna go visit his mom in another state. The next day after he left to drive to his mom i sent them to my mom, my dad and both my other sisters. My whole family was disgusted. That day i left the condo because it’s in his name so i didn’t have any commitment legally to it. Then my sisters husbands helped move me into my parents house. It all happened in a day and when my sister got to my parents house all her stuff was outside the house. She tried coming in and my dad went outside and started screaming at her. My other sisters both went outside and they all yelled at her, and told her that she was a disappointment to the family. My dad fired her on the spot. (My older sisters husband is a lawyer so he gave my dad some legal advice on how to cover himself) He told her to get lost. She was crying and i came outside, i threw the condo keys at her and told her to go move in with my boyfriend since they’re so close. I told her i knew everything. Before she could say anything i went inside. There was some more yelling for about 20 minutes and my dad came in, he said my older sisters had to leave and we watched movies. I sent the screenshots to my boyfriend and blocked him. Over the past two weeks my sister has been trying to contact everyone. She had to be escorted off my parents property 2 times already. I heard from my friend my boyfriend got home two days ago and say my sister had been living at his house, he kicked her out and has been trying to contact me. She is essentially homeless and jobless and i don’t know or care what’s happening to her right now. I haven’t had to go to work since the issue that’s happening in the world. My family is completely behind me but my friends are saying i shouldn’t have done all that to my younger sister. The way i see it she deserved it. So, AITA?"
"AITA for boycotting? | I(34m) am a SAHD, my wife(32f) who is a Neurosurgeon, the primary breadwinner and as such makes more than enough for me to stay at home to take care of our child(3f) so that we can provide her with a stable home life without the need of putting her into daycare. I used to work but when we decided we wanted a child I stopped working so I could be with our daughter. 

I love my wife dearly but she's a tornado when she comes home. She calls her office organized chaos so I'm always having to clean up after her and our daughter. We've had many, many discussions about this because I do the cooking, the cleaning, wrangling our daughter, the laundry, run the errands, you name it I do it. I understand my wife is exhausted after coming home but so am I. I never get a break and she doesn't pick up after herself. If I don't get something done that day she makes comments like well did you play your ps4 today instead of finishing up? 

Which admittedly I do sometimes to destress and decompress when our daughter is down for a nap. Last week we were discussing this again and she told me (along these lines) I go and do my job outside of the house so you can do your job inside the house. You're not bringing in any money and aren't even close to working as many hours as I do or contributing the same amount of time for our family especially when you play your games. 

This hurt a lot and feeling unappreciated I decided to stop doing everything. I haven't lifted on hand other than to care for our daughter and she's been coming home calling me an AH for not upholding our arrangement. But I feel I'm not and she should appreciate the things I do contribute even if they aren't monetarily. AITA and just being blind to that fact?

Edit: for reference, my wife is a Neurosurgeon. So 50% of her workload is emergency surgeries. And on-call work can be pretty brutal with off-hours emergencies."
"Aita (or my husband and I) for letting our daughter and friend (18) drink on vacation? | Hello this is my first time posting on here! What a cool community!

Anyways, This happened in December. My parents own a timeshare in Cozumel, and every winter my husband and I go with just our family. We have an 17 year old daughter, and our twin boys at 13. 

This year, we let my daughter bring a friend of hers. It is her friend from school who is in her same grade, I have known this girl for 3 or so years now and she is very sweet. Now, they are both juniors in high school. My husband and I were young once, we know what’s going on, meaning we know kids are drinking. We have caught our daughter a couple of times, and we just educate her on being responsible. Meaning no cars or anything like that. We don’t necessarily punish her or tell her she can’t drink though. 

So vacation comes and goes, and where we stay it’s very easy to obtain alcohol if you’re a minor. I mean half the staff doesn’t card at the resort. So a couple of the nights the girls had some drinks, we were there with them most of the time so they had supervision. My husband and I didn’t think much of it. 

About a week after the trip, my husband gets a call from the father of my daughters friend. He is FUMING. I guess he found out via an Instagram picture that a relative showed him of his daughter on the beach with a margarita. (I had no idea this was posted). The dad was saying everything from us being the “worst parents alive” to “I can call the police and tell them you let my daughter underage drink and that is a serious offense”.  He wanted to come over and talk to us with his wife too. 

I talked to my daughter about this and she said her friend drinks, but her parents are kind of “nuts”. She called them strict but obvious, “I honestly think they believe we all sit and play with barbies still when we hangout” she said they would never expect their daughter to drink underage because she knows it’s illegal. 


We got another phone call from the girls mother promptly bitching us out. Saying their daughter will never be allowed anywhere our daughter is present. And how “lucky” we are that they don’t press charges. Which idek what charges can be pressed for this? The girls weren’t wasted. They were not even drunk it seemed, just a bit giggly. My husband and I thought eventually these parents have a rude awakening coming. 

We still talk about this time to time as this girl still hasn’t been able to see my daughter. Are we assholes for this?

EDIT typo in the title. I meant 17.

EDIT: i saw a comment saying it’s not my job to police her. If she knew her parents do not allow her to drink, isn’t that on her to follow her parents expectations? I don’t think that’s really on us."
"WIBTA if I hoard the good quality toilet paper from my wife? | Quick disclaimer I love my wife very much, but when it comes to this she favors quantity over quality. Her most recent purchase was a 36 roll package of some see through half-ply. Now this is some real John Wayne TP, it won’t take shit from anybody. I went out and got a brand laced with Aloe Vera and it is top notch, HIGHLY recommend. As a loving husband, I have volunteered myself to the guest bathroom for my privacy/her protection and am considering keeping all the good good in there for myself. With that, will I be the asshole for leaving her out to dry?

Edit: This is a light-hearted post. I did throw some of the good stuff in our master bathroom when I got home, just threw this up for debate :). She bought the big pack thinking it would last a while not knowing it was crap (pun intended). I joked with her about it before for those worried about our marriage and communication."
"AITA for sending my children to foreign middle/high schools because I don't trust the local school system? | My wife and I live in a western country. We are from the middle east but we attended university (graduate school) in the current country that we live in and we have lived here for almost 20 years now.

Unfortunately, the public education system in the country that I live in is plagued with tons of nationalist propaganda. Neither my wife nor I felt comfortable putting our kids in a high school here, so we thought about putting them in a private school. Unfortunately the private schools in our area also have agendas that we disagree with. Most of them are run as religious fundamentalist schools and we didn't want our children to go to such schools.

We ended up finding some great private boarding schools overseas that are well-renowned for their education so we decided to send our kids there when they turned 13. It is certainly expensive but we thought the education would be worth it. Now, six years later our oldest child is graduating and going to a good university and our youngest is still in high school overseas. They love the country they go to school in and they also love the school itself. They come back home to visit us every year during the winter holiday season as well as over the summer.

Our friends in the area that we live in think we are some sort of mentally insane conspiracy theorists because we don't trust the local schools. We have actually lost some of our good family friends over this situation. Many of our old friends and people in our town seem to think that we hate the country we live in and are some sort of radical extremists set on destroying the foundation of the country. This is not the case. We love the town we live in and the country we live in but we disagree with the direction that the country has been heading towards, so we wanted our kids to be educated overseas.

Are we the assholes here? I really like to believe that we aren't since we are just looking out for the futures of our children."
"AITA for not going to XMas church w/ husband and daughter and not giving reason why? | Currently fighting with husband and need honest judgment. 

Husband and I have been together for 11 years. At start, he was agnostic at best. I was indifferent but not raised religious. 

About 4 years in, he started to want to go back to church. He picked a super liberal church (no problem with that) and I’d go occasionally.  After our daughter was born, I agreed to baptize her and that she could go to church with him. 

Our daughter’s birth and my infertility have been very traumatizing to me and has worsened over the years (hello therapy) but I am angry at the concept of G*d and religion. Since we have moved, I have refused to go with them but have never been argumentative or judgy about it. It’s just their Sunday thing. 

Now fast forward to Christmas. My husband is livid that my family’s annual party interferes with Christmas mass at his new church. We aren’t hosting so I can’t change the time. 

But he kept asking why I wasn’t mad because I couldn’t go either. When I said I never would, he freaked out on me. He claimed it wasn’t fair that I wouldn’t tell him why I didn’t believe anymore. It got very heated. 

I don’t think it is fair to force anyone to go to church or share why they have moved away from religion. He doesn’t think it’s fair I won’t have a discussion with him on why I dislike church and my traumas around it since we are married. He also thinks I should play lip service and go on xmas because it’s Christmas and my daughter will be there. 

So AITA here?"
"AITA for keeping a jacket that was mismarked at a much lower price and getting the store employee in trouble? | 
I found an nice leather jacket for $99 instead of $299 at a small boutique. It was a fantastic find as it was really great quality.

One of the employees rung me up and I was out the door almost across the street to my car when she calls out to me from the side walk. 

I jog back thinking I probably forgot something, but she apologizes and tells me the jacket was actually marked wrong and wasn’t $100 and was actually $200 more. She then motions me inside saying she’ll reverse the charge if I don’t want the jacket anymore.

Took me a moment to process that. All I could think was fuck no had she figured it out a minute later I would be gone and I had a receipt proving I had bought it, so it was mine.

I just said “sorry, no. I’m keeping the jacket” and jogged back across the street to my car.

What makes rethink it was when I got to my car I stopped for a minute and could see her talking to who I’m guessing was her boss and they were were clearly angry at her.

Edit. I didn’t know the price was wrong until she told afterwards. The tag said $99.99."
"AITA for telling a guy with special needs to “just shut up already” at a sporting event? | So I’m watching a college basketball game, and there’s a guy who is yelling every time the opposing team has a possession. Like a deep “Ahhhh” sound...think the Tarzan yell, but without the varying inflection. Just...”Ahhhhh!” The entire time the other team has the ball. That’s like 50% of the game.

The guy looks like he might be in college (early to mid 20s). We go to games regularly, and I’ve never seen (or heard) this guy before. I see other people sitting near us looking at the guy, shooting him dirty glances, turning around to look at him, and a general feeling of annoyance is building in the area. My friend who knows we’re at the game is watching the game at home...and he texted me to ask if we could hear the guy yelling. So the fans at home can hear this dude on the television broadcast. Guy is being fucking LOUD.

I don’t know if anyone else asked him to be quiet. But I was tired of it. So on my way to the bathroom, the other team had the ball, so dude was yelling his head off. As I walked past him, I said, “Man, can you just shut up already?” And then he looked startled. I didn’t think anything of it, then made my way to the bathroom. As I was making my way back to my seat, a woman was waiting to meet me at the top of the stairs. She said that the yelling guy has special needs, and that it was really rude of me to tell him to shut up. I apologized to her, but I also said that it doesn’t excuse him yelling the whole game. I didn’t yell at him or anything, but I was definitely more than a little sassy when I told him to shut up.

My friends I’m with are split pretty about this issue. Some are saying I’m an asshole because I shouldn’t have said anything to begin with. My other friends are saying that special needs are not an excuse to be excessively annoying. I’m conflicted; I don’t know if I would have been as blunt had I known the guy had special needs...but I still might have asked him or the people he was with if he could knock it off. I dunno...so the only solution here is to ask reddit: AITA in this situation?

EDIT TO ADD: this whole occurred maybe five minutes after halftime, and he wasn’t yelling during halftime. Someone mentioned he may have been nonverbal. I saw what looked like him talking to the people he was with during timeouts and at other points in the game. After I told him to shut up, he wasn’t completely quiet, but it was more of what I would consider regular cheering, ie., yelling when the other team shoots, when they’re on the free throw line, etc."
"AITA for not explaining my tattoo? |  

Few months back, long distance GF, I'm visiting her 2 hours away. She brings me to a dinner/trivia/bar night with 5 of her friends (7 of us total) so they can ""meet her new man"". Light talk is going on while we look at menus. I have my GF on one side, and let's call him Stanley on the other side. Stanley is nice, everybody is, but I am uncomfortable. I'm an introvert with heavy social anxiety, so it's quite a task for me to have dinner in noisy public with 5 strangers in a strange town with a new GF where I am the only curiosity. I know it will be tough but I always try anyway. In fairness, I have unintentionally been rude or weird or standoffish in the past because I am so uncomfortable at things like dinner parties. I also have RBF.

I have tattoos on my Stanley-side arm. They're not easily recognized images or words, so I get questions. Sometimes I indulge, or I don't; my tattoos have long convoluted explanations that are boring if you aren't me. People asking assume it will be short (i.e. Its My Son's Birthday In A Cool Font type of shit). To politely boil them down to a quick soundbyte feels fake, so either a full breakdown (which makes me self conscious that I am talking about myself too long) or a polite nope are my options. For example, one is a musical math problem I came up with to track measures across 3 or 4 turntables for planning double drops while DJing. The short version I just gave explains nothing really, so a long version is the only way to answer. I actively read and use the tattoo while I play, so it's just as much a practical tool as it is art.

Stanley asks about the music tattoo. I like him, he is being friendly, but something in me just didn't want to talk about myself yet. I also am not comfortable outright saying ""I have social anxiety and could we talk about something besides my physical features and maybe i'll open up later"" because these are her friends and I'm trying not to be too weird. I just say thanks but it's hard to explain. He persists (no really, what is it), I say ohhh it's just some technical music thing. Dinner goes on, trivia goes on, for all I can tell a regular decent evening is had.

Months later GF says I was an asshole for this. She says Stanley was trying to help me be part of the group and I shut him down.  She says I made things weird, the rest of the table became uncomfortable, and says nobody asked me questions for the rest of the night. But we all talked about lots of stuff all night, I never caught any weird looks, everything seemed just normal.

She says if I don't want to explain it, then I should wear long sleeves. This, to me, rings of ""don't wear short skirts if you don't want male attention"" logic. But also, by nature I am very bad at judging a room, and performing common social niceties that are so easy for everyone else. So AITA for rebuking Stanley's questions?"
"AITA for refusing to give my girlfriend money for gass? |    
Me and my girlfriend have been together for about 6months. We live a 30minute drive from each other. I don't currently have a car and when we see each other she's the one driving here and to where ever we go. When we go out I always pay for the food or for example movie tickets. I do this because she is the one driving and spending money on gas. We almost exclusively see each other at my place and I pay for all the groceries and household items and such that we use here.  


Recently my girlfriend told me she would want me to give her some gas money since she is the one always driving us to places. I told her I was contributing by paying for our date nights and also pointed out we always hang out in my place eating food that I have bought. After that, she dropped it. Now she brought it up again insisting it is not fair I won't pay for half of the gas. Then I told her okay I would stop paying for our dates and she should also pay for some of the food that she eats at my place if we are going to start paying half for gas. She got mad at this calling me cheap and childish. I think I'm being reasonable and fair.  


Am I the asshole here?"
"AITA for making two girls cry at a party? | I know the tittle sounds bad but I can explain.

I went over to a friends dorm, and he had several friends that I’ve never really met before over. I’m introduced as being funny and we all start talking and drinking.

Eventually this game comes up and everyone seems to want to play it. Basically everyone has a sheet of paper that they write their name on, and there’s several different colored sections on the paper. In the middle there are diffrent cards, one for each color on the paper. Each card has a question on it, and you are supposed to answer it and try to be as mean and creative as possible. You pass your paper around until it comes back to you, and you read them all out loud, and pick the one you thinks funniest. Person with the lowest wins that round drinks.

I didn’t want to play but my friend insisted because he thought I would be good at it, and since he introduced me as funny, everyone agreed.

We play a couple rounds and I am loosing horribly. Everyone else knows each other, so my insults aren’t good, just generic shit that I can tell from them.

Then another person joins. She was a very large girl and a diabetic.

I’m getting schwasted and everyone is encouraging me to be mean. I say I don’t know you guys that well, and don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. Everyone assures me it’s just a game.

It’s the last swap of the round and I am blessed with the fat girls card. The question was soemthing about her doing everything right and if there was anything she can’t do. I said she can’t produce the proper amount of insulin.

It went over well so I kept going. “What advice will she give her grandchildren?” “She won’t live past 23 at the rate she’s going”. 

I insulted everyone and got to drink less.

The next day I see my friend in class and he’s mad at me. He informs me that two of the girls I insulted cried after I left, and that everyone thinks I’m an asshole.

I made it very very clear that I 1) didn’t want to play and 2) didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. I’m not even going to blame anything on being drunk, but I was told to be mean. I was told people could handle it.

AITA"
"AITA For changing Wifi Password on Roommate? | Tonight my roommate refused to pay wifi because someone is eating her food and she is sure it is me.

It is not me.

 She said the 2 other roommates also suggest it was me, backing up her claim. Nobody has any evidence they just think it because to them it is the most likely scenario. One of them is doing it and lieing, but I don't  know who that is. 

I tried to hash it out over group text but we got no where. When I tried to break down their reasoning and show them how there is no evidence at all they stopped responding. 

TL:DR
The roommate falsely accusing me of eating her food has declined two venmo request for wifi, stating she wont pay until the stealing of her food ends. I did not steal her food. 

Today I am changing the wifi password and refunding the two other roommates the money they paid this month for it. Theres no way to remove just one person from the wifi and they will surely share it..Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for not welcoming my children back in my life after their stepfather abandoned them? | **The tl;dr:** I have two daughters 22F and 20F with my first wife. I left them when the eldest was 4. She remarried and when my daughters were of age (16), they decided to take the stepfather's last name despite my protests. They slowly stopped keeping in contact and refused my visits. Stepdad skidaddled four months ago and they want to rejoin my life, I denied them. AITA?

**Full story:** We got married when I was 20, but separated when her mother fell ill and she wanted to move to be within close proximity. My job wouldn't allow it, nor could I find a comparable job where she wanted to move. It was downtown Toronto to rural Alberta, it was an impossible situation.

We had joint custody and I paid child support but no alimony because my wife was a trust fund child. She also stood to inherit railroading money, so there's that as well. I usually paid for any larger things they needed like new beds, dressers, etc furnishing for the girls' rooms but also uniforms, trips, and so on.

We both remarried and my wife and I had a daughter ourselves. She's 13F now. I met the stepfather of my first two daughters and he seemed like a nice enough guy. We all kept in touch and of course I visited my children two or three times a year for weeks at a time.

I don't know what happened but they slowly became distant. My two or three visits a year I was told to cut down to one visit for a couple of days around Christmas. My kids just weren't interested in seeing me anymore for extended periods. Then they decided to change their name, thankfully letting me know beforehand so I can vent my thoughts but ultimately they went with it. It's their life, I have no control over it, but I stressed how it hurts coupled with the reduced visit times.

Once the oldest was 18 she went no contact with me. Then when the younger was 18 the same thing happened. Removed from Facebook, changed numbers, and so on. I tried once to make an unannounced visit and they threatened to call the police, so I left. I want to stress I'm not leaving anything out here: I didn't do anything to warrant this, I don't know why they decided things would be this way.

I figured this was the end and our relationships were severed. I still had my new family, my daughter and wife, and we were doing okay. I decided to just leave my old life behind. I retired, I have a large estate which my 13F daughter stands to now inherit.

The stepfather up and left four months ago and suddenly my ex-wife and two daughters want nothing more than to reconnect. I think it's awfully convenient timing. Both my daughter reached out to me and I denied them, saying it's been over five years of a strained relationship at no fault of my own; they made their bed and now they need to sleep in it. Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for writing a fake review of my coworker to improve her work ethic? | TL;DR - had worst coworker in the world, learned she read our restaurant reviews and was self-conscious so I wrote a fake review insulting her customer service. She improved herself but I'm feeling guilty, thinking perhaps I could've talked to her again and convinced her better.

&#x200B;

I'm a manager at a small family owned business in a small town. One of my coworkers was completely lazy and we all had to remind her to do her job on a daily basis. She wouldn't greet customers and stare at them until they ask her for help first, she'd text her boyfriend throughout her shift, she complained about how tired she is and leave after working for an hour, and I got one customer complaint at the least about her every time she works.

&#x200B;

She hadn't been fired because she is the best friend of the owner's daughter.

&#x200B;

One thing I learned about her is that she constantly reads customer reviews and is incredibly self-conscious about how other people think of her. So I wrote a fake customer review recounting how the customer received terrible service from her, making sure to describe her (she has a very distinct hair colour and piercings) as best as I could, how she should be fired and how she forfeited a big tip.

&#x200B;

A week goes by and my coworker comes in with significantly less piercings and a completely different hair colour, as well as significantly improved her work ethic. After questioning her, she mentioned the review and knew she had to pick up her slack. It's been a few months and she's a model employee and a joy to work with.

&#x200B;

I'm feeling a little guilty now. Every single employee and our boss had talked to her and attempted to re-train her to improve herself, but it never worked. Instead of writing that review and keeping her on edge all the time, perhaps I could've attempted to talk to her and explain how shitty she's being.

&#x200B;

So, AITA?

EDIT: I would like to say that when I mentioned her hair colour and piercings in the review, I didn't mean that I was attacking her appearance, but to make her easily identifiable to herself when she read the review. I assume she changed her appearance to separate herself from the review."
"AITA for spending my money on donations towards a streamer? | So my mom kinda blew up at me last night and I wanted to know if I was in the wrong for this.

So I (15 M) get about $150 a month from my mom as my allowance, to spend on whatever makes me happy. Sometimes I buy video games, movie tickets, currency for games, etc, but this month I’ve been really into watching people’s live-streams. If you are not familiar with live streams, if you enjoy the streamer, you can donate to them. I found this one streamer that I LOVE and I have spent about $100 in donations to them this month for things like just showing my support, getting them to read my names, or other little things.

My mom saw that a lot of my money this month was going to the website, and asked me what I was doing on there, and I explained that I was donating to my favorite streamer. She got really upset with me and said that the $150 was meant for me and my wants and not to give to people that already have money. I argued that the $150 is my allowance and I should be able to do what I want with it, but she didn’t agree. She told me that if I spend an “excessive” amount on donations again for January, she’s going to cut off my allowance, and I think it’s unfair. AITA?"
"AITA for trying to sell a pdf? | As the 2nd college semester started in February, I bought all the books I needed included one in particular. A lot of the courses specify you don't need to buy the book to pass, but it can help you.

Fast forward to a week ago, a lot of students on the course chat (200+ people) complained that the book was unavailable anywhere and it was impossible to buy it. The content of this book (poems along with their translation) is shared by the professors in slides only during the lessons, so if you follow them you can manage without book. You can also find them online with the translation, but it won't be the same translation the professor uses. After I read some messages I wrote that since I had the physical copy of the book, I could scan the needed parts and sell the pdf for a symbolic figure (I paid with my own money the book and scanning take some time). No one replied so I thought no one was interested, so I went along with my day.

half an hour later, one of my friends contacted me and told me I was being an asshole for not helping our coursemates: since I had the money to buy it I could share it. I replied it wasn't completely necessary, and I was selling it for under 5$ so it would be a lot cheaper for them. He then proceeded to say on the group chat I was a bitch, and a lot of people agreed with him, saying means stuff and so. From my point of view, I was only trying to help and I didn't understand the reaction. AITA?  


EDIT: In my country, you can scan up to 25% of the book, which I was aware of. It would be a stupid move to scan the entire book and give it away publicly."
"AITA For Wanting to Split Living Costs 50/50 With My GF? | I'm M22, and she's f23 and we've been together for about 1.5 yrs. I rent a place by myself since I graduated and needed to move downtown for a job last June. My GF brought up wanting to move in together last week and I would love that but I told her she'd have to cover half the rent, utils and groceries. She said thats a huge dick move since I make around 80k this year and she's making around 45k. She even asked her friends and they said that I'm a douche and an ass for wanting her to pay half of everything. 

AITA?"
"AITA for refusing to bring my daughter's girlfriend to our family reunion? | I know I seem bad, but hear me out.
 
Traditionally family reunions only included family for us. That does include engaged and married relations, obviously. We usually don't let people bring their dates to the event. 
 
Thisn year, I got to host the reunion. My daugter wanted to bring her GF, and I just refused. She knows why I refused, but made it out to be that I was homophobic. Her words were ""Dad, just because Papa is homophobic doesn't mean I can't bring my date"". She then said that her sister got to bring her date last year.
 
Her sister got to bring her date since he was family. 3rd cousins, they didn't know it, and they broke up the very same day. Honestly a bit funny.
 
So, AITA?"
"AITA for telling a girl I just met that I don’t find her attractive | Ok so I was at a party with some friends and I was talking to my friend Christine. So Christine asked me if I thought another one of my friends “Laura” was cute and I told her that I thought Laura was cute but not really my type. Well about five minutes after this private conversation, I was in a bigger group and there was a girl “Michelle” who looked very similar to Laura. 
Well I couldn’t hide the fact that I had found a true doppelgänger to my friend Laura , who wasn’t at this party, so I mentioned to the group that Michelle was “giving me serious Laura vibes”. I never said it was a bad thing but Christine then decided to chime in and ask me if that meant that I wasn’t into Michelle (who already has a bf). So as to not try to stir up any awkwardness I told Michelle that I wasn’t really attracted to her because she wasn’t my type.  
She then decided to leave the group and I never apologized and we never really talked after that but I heard from her friends that she thought it was rude and was hurt by my words."
"WIBTA if I had an abortion and then told my ex I was pregnant with his child? | Okay so my partner and I of two and a half years broke up a few weeks ago, I've known since just before that I'm pregnant and I was going to tell him when I saw him in person that I was, but he broke up with me. I didn't tell him because I didn't want to put pressure on him to stay, as that would be unfair. I'm thinking about an abortion because I don't think I want children yet and honestly, I'm not in the best place mentally to take care of myself, let alone a child. Would I be the asshole if I told him after having a termination rather than discussing it with him before I go? I'm 12 weeks if that matters. TIA"
"WIBTA for missing a friend's wedding? | So to give some background, I've (23M) been friends with this guy (23M) since freshman year of high school. We used to be best friends all through high school and first year of college. Then around our 2nd-3rd year of college, we started to drift apart. We reconnected about two years ago and have been friends, but not as close as we were.

So, fast forward to 2 years ago, he proposed to his girlfriend of 3 years. A few months ago, me and some other people in my friends group got ""save the date"" notices.

Well, his wedding is now two weeks from tomorrow and we haven't gotten any other details. We don't have a time or a location, just a date. I talked to the other guys in my friends group and most of them aren't planning on going since he's failing to provide us with any other information and to be fair, I don't blame them.

I've debated reaching out to him to ask for more details but at the same time, I'm not sure if it's worth bothering since he hasn't bothered to send me or any of our other friends any info yet.

I'm having a housewarming party tomorrow since I just moved into a new place last weekend. I invited him and he said he might come. If he comes to that, I'll for sure ask him about his wedding and if he has any more info for me. If he doesn't show, I'm honestly thinking of just saying ""screw it"" and not showing up if he can't provide me with any more details between now and then.

WIBTA for not showing up? Should I reach out and text him for details?

UPDATE: I decided to reach out and text him just now asking where and what time the wedding will be. If he replies with that info, I'm there. If not, well then I'll assume I'm not invited and even if I am, not much I can do when he won't send me the info I need in order to show up"
"WIBTA if I have a bigger party than my sister on the same day she's having one at our house | Update: thanks for everyone's input when my sister came home today I spoke to her about a joint party and didn't mention anything about a stupid party as I realised from all the comments I just sound like a right dick. 
As I was talking about splitting the main area of our house which is a living room connected to a dining room connected to a conservatory. I suggest one group in the living and the other in the conservatory as our friends are of different kinds. I put forward the dining room table has hand food and the kitchen would have some actual good maybe take out. 
Upon hearing this my mum popped up and told me that my sister has been looking at houses with her family recently and she may not be at the house by that time. My sister replied ""I'd still have the party here even if I've moved out"" so I just told her we should split the house like I suggest as it's only fair. 
Thanks for the all comments and advice, me and my sister don't often get along and we butt heads often so the thought of a joint party didn't come into mind as everything is usually a competition with us. 

So my sister (24F) recently told me she wants to have a party on new year's eve but my (20M) birthday is on new years eve and obviously with it being 21 it's a big deal (I don't see why because I'm British so I've been drinking a long time) and she knows every year I have a party at our house because obviously it's my birthday.

When telling me and I objected she basically told me ""you're just going to have to deal with it we've already sorted it out in the group chat"" which I think is her and about 6 friends. I think this is a bit of a dick move as she already takes over the house with her boyfriend (23M) and her two kids a 4 year old boy and a 8 month old girl. So usually I'm cooped up in my room 24/7 unless I'm at uni or at my SO's I think it's unfair that on my birthday she wants to take over the house with her friends. 

So WIBTA for just inviting everyone I know and their mums (not literally inviting their mums) to my house on new years as a counter party and fill the house with people so her friends wouldn't want to be there?

EDIT: INFO my mum owns the house"
"AITA for using a connection I have with a business to potentially give my GF an edge on a job application? | GF is trying to apply to work in a local long term care home as a nurse. It just so happens that the company I work for donates yearly to their big fundraiser and I am the one who handles the donations and works with the fundraising staff on their end. I receive a thank you letter each year from them.

I recently mentioned to my contact there that my GF was applying and if there was a specific person she should address the cover letter to. I always think it's better to be able to address to a person directly vs. ""to whom it may concern"". Not only did my contact give me the name of the person, but offered to pass along Gf's application directly, which I thought was very kind.

GF thinks this isn't cool and that I am abusing the system. She feels that they may only hire her to make sure they don't lose the yearly donation (not true, it would have no impact on future donations either way). I think this is more of how business works. Referrals are still the number one way people get hired according to HR studies. She would still have to pass the interview and have the right skills for the job.

Some friends we asked seem split, so I came here to ask Am I the Asshole for using my contacts to help give my GF an advantage here?"
"AITA for jaywalking with my 5-year-old daughter or is my husband the asshole for saying I failed at ""my only job"" (parenting) | My husband and our two kids were playing at at a park across the street from a library. We were leaving and crossing the street to head to our car. The street is a one way street and there is a crosswalk in the middle. This is not a major city or anything. We are a university town with 95 thousand while school is in session, and traffic was light at this time. 

 My 5-year-old daughter and I were crossing the street together and we were on the sidewalk right across from our car. Rather than walk to the cross walk, I instructed my daughter to visually assess for cars and since there were none in sight, we crossed quickly. This made my husband livid. 

He said I was endangering our daughter by failing to teach her to go to the crosswalk. He said teaching her to cross the street correctly is something I should be able to do because teaching the kids is my ""only job"" and I failed. I explained that I instructed our daughter to visually assess for danger, looking both ways, before crossing and I thought this was adequate for this situation. He said it wasn't and that I didn't know how to teach her because I ""grew up playing in junkyards;"" (I grew up very poor and did in fact play in a junkyard as a child.) He then said I didn't know how to cross the street correctly because no one cared enough to teach me how. And then he said literally every mother would agree with him that I was incompetent and reckless for crossing the street this way. 


He said all of this in front of our children who are 5 and 2. 

I guess I'm just wondering if what he said was true and necessary because I'm an asshole for jaywalking or if it crossed a line. 

Insight appreciated."
"AITA for leaving my cheating wife and her child for good? | I like to keep this as short as possible and leave out any unnecessary details. If you feel like you need more information, just ask. Also, English is not my first language, so my wording might come over a bit strange at times.


So last week, due to a digital blunder, I did find out that my wife of 7 years has been cheating on me 5 years ago. When confronted, my wife did confess and I further learned that our child is a result of said affair - hence, it's not actually mine. Cheating is an absolute no-go for me and she knows that. So after I had the confirmation, I immediately decided to divorce, for which I will be filing soon.


Now when it comes to ""my"" kid, something in me changed as well. I always wanted to have kids but to me it's important that they are biologically mine. So I decided to not only leave my wife but also her child for good. It will be up to the the court whether I will have to pay alimony and if I have to, I will. But I will cut all contact. I know it will be hard for the kid and I know that the kid did nothing wrong. But neither did I. I didn't sign up for this so I am walking out. My soon-to-be ex-wife and her infidelity is to blame entirely.


Am I the asshole?




EDIT: Talking about strange wording, many people are critizing me for referring to the child as ""it"". Sorry about this, I honestly didn't know this was inappropriate in English."
"update: AITA for not wanting to be the maid of honor at my best friends wedding...pregnant and marrying my ex. I drove 7 hours to talk it out with her. | I got so many nice comments on my original, and my first ever gold,  I figured I owed everyone an update and sort of what I'm thinking now after getting a chance to talk it out with Tammy and see Gregory for the first time in almost 2 years. I needed the original is here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/aneyb5/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_the_maid_of_honor_at/


I posted the original on Tuesday morning. I pretty much couldn't focus on anything else so I took the rest of the week off to have a self pity party. That wasn't working so I just decided screw it, I'm going to drive 7 hours to see Tammy and just tell her how I was feeling. I texted her on the way and she said she was happy I was coming. I really wanted to address all the very good questions you good people had brought up in my post from Tuesday. 

So I got there and we basically hugged hello and I have to admit I was very happy to see her. What was so fucking weird is it was obvious Gregory was living in her place now. I don't even know why I hadn't even thought about this but he's a pretty messy dude so when I saw cereal bowls on the coffee table and socks on the floor (shit that used to drive me up the wall)...I was like wow...this is real. Thank god Greg wasn't there and Tammy apologized that she just didn't feel good enough to clean up before she heard I was coming. 

So our conversation basically centered around what happened and why she never told me. At first she was kind of talking around it to spare my feelings and I got sort of frustrated with her and told her to please just tell me what happened. So it turns out they went out as a group right after I gave her Greg's number and they just had an immediate attraction. They said that for the first few times they hung out it was all just reminiscing about our college days and never mentioned the attraction. I guess about two weeks of hanging out they kissed for the first time and she was so pissed at herself she blocked his number and didn't see him for almost a month. I guess she got lonely again, they ran into each other and admitted they had real feelings. She said she texted me and told me she wanted to talk about it right after they agreed to start dating (I found this out on my own on Tuesday after going through my texts, but since I was so busy I wasn't very nice to her) but she knew I was busy and really wavered on interrupting the most important time in my professional career vs telling me some very hard to swallow news. She said rightly or wrongly she decided to tell me in person when she saw me again. Fast forward a little bit I guess they so serious they talked about eloping after only two months and were pretty much living together. She said they had a drunken new years even party and just weren't careful and that's when she assumes she got pregnant. She said she knew then that it was an in person conversation she had to have with me, her first free weekend was last weekend. 


So I basically responded to all of this by saying I just didn't know how to feel. That in my brain I knew Gregory and I were not compatible but my heart always hoped we'd grow up and be able to make it work AND she was my best friend AND I basically hooked them up. And I just don't know how to deal with all this. I know it's over but even seeing his shit on her floor was sort of painful (honestly, that would have been a massive fight between Greg and I, like I said Tammy is much more chill). I told her that I would always love her and always be her friend but an April wedding is probably just too soon to be involved in a wedding party. She said she totally understood. 


We talked about the elephant in the room for maybe 20 more minutes but honestly we were just talking in circles, saying the same thing over and over again. So we just sort of moved on to how she was feeling, how work was going, me apparently wearing some sort of man repellent because I can't even hook up on Tinder  and all the other things friends usually talk about.  Tammy is in full blown morning sickness so she must have barfed 15 times in the first two hours of me being there. At first I just let her do her thing...but then I felt really bad because we've been friends for over 20 years and I'm not even helping her. So I went in and helped put her hair in a pony tail and rubbed her back. And that's when it hit me that I would absolutely regret it and never be able to forgive myself if I weren't there for her wedding, pregnancy and having a baby...no matter who she was marrying. 


We went to lunch and at that point I told her I was sorry I was being selfish and I would be her maid of honor. She said no way I was being selfish but would never have another maid of honor besides me. It's not going to be the easiest thing in my life but I can't not do it. 


So we went back to her apartment and Gregory was home. Suddenly I felt like such an idiot because I couldn't possibly be in their wedding, let alone ever be around the two of them together. That was the most awkward hello I've ever had in my life (and thank god he'd cleaned up because I was just amped up with nerves to scream at him like I would have in the past). We sort of awkwardly sat on their couch not saying much but after a few minutes I just started telling myself again to grow up, don't let my own feelings get in the way of two people who may really belong together. 


Seeing them in person together is even more saccharine sweet than I thought possible. They are perfect for each other. Gregory is supportive (I don't know how many times I had to claim best friend privilege when she got sick over loving fiancé privilege) and sweet and she's far more tolerant of him than I could ever possibly be. It was still hard for the rest of the evening but I think it will get better with time. I decided again I would be in heir wedding. 

We had dinner and I got a hotel because even though I'm trying, i'm not ready to sleep in the same house as them. Tammy has to work today so i'm just hanging out before I see her for lunch than i'm going to drive back home.  We have a long, long way to go but I'm so glad I came to see her because at the very least we saw each other and talked it out and I'm very happy that I'm going to be involved in these major life events with her. 


thank you so much for all the input the other day and thank you for reading all this. 

tl;dr: my best friend is pregnant and marrying my ex boyfriend. She told me on Sunday, I had an AITA post that blew up on Tuesday and I travelled to see her yesterday to hash it out. Things are uncomfortable but she is and will always be my best friend and I've decided I'm going to be in her wedding. 


Edit: guys holy shit! This has blown up again. I literally just got home and have over 200
Inbox notifications. Thank you so much for the gold and silver. I can’t waif to read all this! Thank you so much!


Edit 2: I totally passed out last night so I didn't get to participate like I would have. I have to jump in and defend Tammy, maybe no one will see this because it's probably time this fades. Maybe no one will belive me but for all the critisms of her there's a good explanation that can most likely be explained away by me being a bad writer or not wanting this to be a narcissistic novel. For example, I saw someone saying ""Tammy should have called after the first kiss."" I've known her for so long to know that she knows I can be very irrational and angry (I alluded to it in the other post but I had to do a year of anger management therapy because I can be like dynamite when I get pissed, I'm way better now but she probably has legit ptsd from some of my freak outs) and she figured it was a one time thing so why poke the bear if that makes sense. 

Secondly, I can't stress enough how busy I was last fall. Not an exaggeration to say I was working 16+ hours a day with maybe a day off every 20-30 days. I was planning a huge event that centered around a true narcissist and he would have me on my phone, texting questions and answers all day long. The last thing I wanted to do in my time off was get on my phone. I can count from that period and I'd say it averages 10 to 1 of Tammy texting me (I assume calls were worse) but one stretch I think I counted she texted me 40 times before I texted her back. It's bad timing more than anything because anyone of those may have been when she wanted to tell me. And I definitely appreciate her thoughtfulness of not wanting to spring it on me while I was losing my mind from lack of sleep at work. I agree with her that this was an in person conversation anyways. 

I know Tammy is just an Internet Sprite to all but one of you (and that is so f-ing tworedditorsonecup thing, I wish I had the energy to do another post) but she is a real person who has been my ride or die since we were 10 and 11. We've fought, screwed each other over so many times and we've always forgiven each other because having her in my life is way more important than pining over a guy I spent most of my time frustrated with anyways. Don't get me wrong, I'm still pining and I cried last night over this...but like so many people said, maybe Tam-Tam's best gift to me as a friend was forcing me to get on with shit...maybe 10 years and 40+ breakups and just as many  broken dishes and slammed doors...she was the sign the universe sent to make me move on from a guy who wasn't right for me.

"AITA for not wanting to spend $1,400 on best friends Bachelorette Party? | I have a coworker who became a close friend over the past year and a half. She’s getting married in 5 months, and having her bachelorette party in 3 months. When she initially invited me on the trip I was thrilled to be included. She’s from out of state and therefore I don’t know anyone else going along but I saw this as a fun and exciting opportunity to meet her friends and family from back home and celebrate her upcoming marriage! 

The bachelorette party is a 3-day cruise and the group of girls is working with a travel agency to book the trip. The pricing is very complicated since there are numerous types of rooms as well as “perks” you can add on to your trip, such as unlimited drinks or special excursions. That being said, the actual cost of the trip was a little foggy at first. I’m rooming with 2 girls whom I’ve never met and that live across the country from me, so I kind of told them to go ahead and take the lead and just let me know how much I owe them. 

However, I come to find out today that the cruise alone is just under $800 a person (reminder... it’s a 3 day cruise). Additionally, we have to fly to the port which is about $350 and stay in a hotel the night before which also costs about $100. Also, we are expected to divvy up the brides portion of the trip, which ends up being another $110 or so per person. That being said, this trip is coming in at just under $1,400. 

It’s a 3-day cruise which 11 strangers and 1 friend, and I also will have to pay for me and my boyfriends flight and hotel to the actual wedding 2 months after this trip, which I’m estimating to cost around $1,200. 

All of that being said, AITA for backing out of this trip after I have told her how thrilled I am to go on multiple occasions? She’s even complained to me about other family members and friends who have backed out because of the expenses and I rolled my eyes alongside her. But now when push comes to shove, I’m realizing how much it’s actually going to cost me and wanting to get out at the last minute.

AITA? What would you do in this situation? What’s the customary amount of money one is expected to spend on a friends bachelor/bachelorette party?? 

Also it’s fair to note that I have a stable income, and she knows how much I earn since we work together. It’s not like I absolutely cannot afford it, but there’s just many many other things I would rather spend $1,400 on. If I absolutely did not have the money to go, then I would think it is fair to assume I am NOT the asshole. However, her and I both know that I can afford this trip."
"AITA for not allowing my SIL to wear an offensive shirt? | My husband's younger sister has always been...colorful.  She pushes the boundaries of social norms and politeness. She isn't rude, per se, but eclectic, I guess you could say.  Let's just get this out of the way - I don't like her that much. We are not alike at all! Normally, I just brush it off, smile, whatever, because she is my husband's sister. But I feel like she has gone too far this time by showing up at our picnic wearing a shirt that had a silhouette of Jesus on the cross and says ""Nailed it."" I understand not everyone is religious. I do not push my religion on her or anyone else. But this is too much.

This isn't the first time we have had religious disagreements.  She is CLEARLY anti-religion and likes offensive jokes, but like I said, I'd normally just brush it off. But to come into my home with a shirt that is so disgusting? I've had it. I told her she needs to leave and if she wants to ever come back, she will not EVER wear that shirt again. She just kind of laughed, which makes me so much angrier.

Some of the people there (mainly my family) agree that it was super distasteful. My husbands other sister is neutral, or just not saying anything, whatever. But the kicker is my husband says I am over-reacting. Ok, so say SIL was a vegan (she's not, but I can't think of any other comparison right now), say she was and I show up at her place with murdered animals on my shirt. Would that be okay?? AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT because people are saying I am controlling: She does this type of stuff in subtle ways, but I cannot justifiably say it is BECAUSE I am religious. She would have the offensive jokes and her opinions regardless (I don't care what her or anyone's own opinions are, to be clear).  To me, this was just like displaying it right there and it is different than just ""Jesus isn't real"" or something, you know? THIS HAS BEEN A CULMINATION of it all, and it felt very disrespectful. So while I will believe some of you when I say I come across as controlling, please understand that I have been very patient with her for YEARS.

Edit 2: Many YTA judgements are using my religion and beliefs to somehow justify that i am an AH.

1. This is not what the issue is, at all. I have clearly stated multiple times that the difference of belief is NOT offensive to me.
2. Say i was Jewish and she came up in a Hitler shirt, cool or no? Same type of aggression, imo.
3. Using someone's beliefs against them, like what many are doing here, is an AH thing to do, and also ironic considering you accuss me of that, all in the same breath.

Edit 3 because so much making shit up, I swear. Some comments using her age and the fact I've known her for years as me being ""intolerant"". How old do you think I even am? I'm 11 months older than her!

4: seriously. What religion is it OK for me to compare this to? Can't compare to Judaism. Just even mentioning it, now I'm the AH. Yet it is perfectly fine to talk poorly about Christianity? Why the double standard? I have done nothing to SIL, or anyone here, using my beliefs negatively. 

***
People have been attacking every single comparison I make, so who cares at this point. Take literally anything offensive, put it on a T-shirt, and wear it around someone with intent to offend.

Thanks for the reasonable YTA judgements, the ones that are actually relevant to the situation. Seriously. The other ones who focus entirely on the religious aspect, and even go so far as to make fun of me and my beliefs? Ironic. Generalize Christians and call me intolerant, yet not see the irony in all of it."
"AITA for expecting a compensation for hotel staff entering my room unannounced and leaving without apology. | I went for a weekend away of r&r in Toronto Marriott.

I was bottomless, as one tends to be after a shower.

The locked door was opened.

I got sacred and jumped to cover.

The person entering the room was dead silent and I was terrified (there have been a lot of shootings in the area)

The door closed.

I check: no one was there. I heard laughter.

Figuring the room was  a) double booked or b) it was a person with a lust for scaring folk,      I called the front desk.

They tell me it wasn't a or b, but rather and unexpected C) senior staff had opened my door unannounced

They said the manager would deal with me on Monday.  It happened on Saturday.  The hotel has not resolved the issue.

When I jumped out of the way I hurt my freaking neck and broke my damed phone.

I checked and yep the Marriott charged me for the privallege of being scared shitless by their staff.  They were obviously angry that I outted them, and they didn't try to hid it despite being in the hospitality industry.

The staff never apologized and the corporte office has done nothing to resolve the issue.

REddit, am I a Karen for expecting the hotel to apologize and do something about the security breach?

&#x200B;

oh and the hotel didn't have room service for some reason and the  pool I specifically booked the room to use, had bleach dumped in it at noon, right when I was about to go in, so I couldn't even use the pool.

&#x200B;

reddit, am I an asshole for getting angry that they haven't apologized and that they charged me full price.  It was expensive and it was not relaxing or calm and my neck still freaking hurts.

&#x200B;

edit: I wrote I was expensive, but meant to write it was expensive (hotel)

&#x200B;

edit 2:  immediately after the incident I was not expecting much, but when the staffer who opened the door didn't apologize, when they started saluting me in the halls, when the staff was outwardly expressing anger around me I got freaked out a bit and when corporate said they would resolve the issue I believed them, but it's been almost 6 full days since it happened and I have no resolution.    I hurt my neck when I jumped out of view of the door on Sat and it still hurts (not looking for money, but explaining why I am dumb in writing - lack of blood sucks hard)     I would also like to apologize for any rudeness on my part, I have had too much email contact with serious asshats who caused me bodily harm that I still suffer from and I lost all other human contact for a really long time, it's not an excuse, but just the background, cause I'm remembering how to be human via just words and not have pain or fear or what happened to me taint everything else, and to that end, I've relearned an old trick., as I respond I'm looking in the mirror, it's a stupid trick that works, when I look at myself while responding I tend to respond the same way I would in real life to a person who has not hurt me.   I am sorry to those who were effected by my rudeness I take ownership of it.

&#x200B;

Edit3: last one I think:  So apparently there is a varied view on what is and is not acceptable from hotel staff, half of you said NTA, the other half said YTA, but with comments that I am a dick in general and had no relation to the question in hand, and to each their own.   I did learn that apparently it's a dick move to look at a persons comment history to see if they are trolling you, but then question why it's available to get group at all, but w/e.

I learned that some of you don't ever seek compensation when things you paid for have gone wrong- I think that's odd, but we all live different lives and maybe some of us have more disposable income then others, maybe some of us are okay with bad things happening, maybe some of us have PTSD and freak out when bad things happen, maybe some of us are just asses.

The Hotel has contacted me and has ensured me that the issue will be resolved to my satisfaction, whatever that means. To some it could be a free room, to others a letter of apology, like I said to each their own.

To the folk who think I'm an ass for expecting an apology, please, please don't let ever let people walk on you or steal your shine.

The most valuable thing I learned is to look a mirror when responding as it makes the responses more human, and that I was always okay with my decision to seek compensation as I was surprisingly defensive to people calling me an ass for asking for it, this was a very useful learning tool and I appreciate all the responses I got, even the ones calling me a drama queen."
"WIBTA if I didn't tell my son his dog has died? | My (35m) son (19m) is currently away at university stuck in his apartment (we couldn't get him a ticket home in time and he has no car). Currently he has his mid-term exams coming up (all online of course and delayed due to the transition) and has been studying for those (hopefully). Last night our dog died, I know that my son and him were very close and will be upset about this. The problem is I don't want him to spend time mourning the dog until all of his exams are finished. I plan on telling him that he died in a week or so but my wife says that that's cruel. WIBTA if I withheld that information from him for the time being?"
"AITA for taking 30 dollars from my dad to pay for a doctors co-pay without telling him? | I am 17, and grounded for the next month over something silly. 

&#x200B;

I don't have a job (yes, I am aware I should have one lol), so I rely on an allowance from my parents to pay for most things. I don't exactly spend a lot of money, but for things like doctors appointments or school fees and such they pay for it. 

&#x200B;

I had to get my teeth drilled today for a cavity, and I was running super late and my dad was walking the dog. Tried calling him about a dozen times, no answer. I needed 30 dollars to pay for the copay at the dentist. I decided to just take matters into my own hands and go to his money stash and take 30 bucks. Well, 2 20s, so 40 bucks, but that's all that was there. 

&#x200B;

I talked to him when I was out of the dentist, and I told him I took the money and he was FURIOUS at me. Saying that I basically robbed him, and that it doesn't matter if I absolutely needed it, its still taking his property without his permission. It seemed like it was a matter of principle to him more than he cared about the money. I argued with him a bit, saying that I had no other choice, and that I didn't think he would care because its for something necessary, and that just made him more mad and he grounded me for a month. 

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole for this? My mom agrees with him, and so does my aunt who also scolded me briefly about it, agreeing with him."
"AITA for throwing SO under the bus? | Threw my partner under the bus

My SO (23f) and I (25m) are on holiday and our argument began during a hire car exchange, we had to return our hire car on day 1 of the holiday for another car. Whilst I was inside the hire company office doing the exchange, my SO was in charge of removing our bags and belongings.

I acquired our replacement car and drove it round to collect partner + belongings. After driving 5 hours to our first location, the hire company rang to inform that SO had left our camera bag in the car (expensive gift from my sister).

As frustrating as it was, we looked past it in the hopes for enjoying our holiday.

My sister sent me a text, to see if I was enjoying the new camera, to which I responded with the truth, that SO had left it in the car and, it was waiting for us at the airport for when we depart.

SO has blown up saying I’m an asshole for not taking equal blame for not checking either. 

AITA?"
"AITA for not comforting my husband when he started crying because he was the one who started the fight | My husband today made a stupid fat joke knowing that I’m insecure about my weight(I just had a baby 4 months ago). 

I yelled at him and said it was insensitive and that if he ever talked to me like that again he’d be out on the curb, and that he should apologize right now. He tried to argue with me about it so I yelled at him again and he apologized.

I went into the bedroom to get ready to leave because I was supposed to meet my friends. I saw him crying on the sofa and I just left because I couldn’t deal with that. 

I told my friends and they all called me a bitch and that he apologized and they basically kicked me out and told me to go home and fix it.

I’m now sitting in the car in a McDonalds. AITA?"
"WIBTA for not adding my GF to house buying paperwork? | GF of 5 years and I are wanting to buy a house. We currently rent a house in an area where rent has increased significantly over the past 4 years but house prices have only nominally increased. 


A little backstory on our relationship: We dont believe in marriage and have no plans to ever get married. We are however in a committed relationship. She has historically been terrible with money and as such does not have any savings to her name along with some dubious credit. I currently pay probably 65% of our expenses and then she covers the rest. When we purchase the house the entire 20% downpayment (~80K) will be fronted by myself and then we will split monthly costs as we do today. 

WIBTA for having the house only in my name? She has always wanted a house of her own but I feel Im making the majority investment here and that our lending rate will likely be worse with her on the mortgage."
"AITA for wanting to spend my(?) money on beer? | My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years. Over the last six months we've fell on especially hard times with me getting hospitalized and subsequently losing my job (boss was a nut job that wanted me to come in immediately after being released so I quit). Unrelated, my father made a habit about a year ago of sending me money almost weekly. It was not asked for; he is doing it out of the kindness of his heart and it is always appreciated. He sends it through Facebook pay and as I don't have my own active bank account, I linked it to my boyfriend's bank, always considering our money to be just that--ours.

The total averages about $30 weekly.

Now that I've lost my job, I've been more than happy to just let him have it to cover any and all expenses as he may see fit. Today, my dad sent me $60 out of nowhere. Also today, I landed a decent paying job that I'll begin orientation for on Monday. To celebrate, I thought I would buy myself a couple beers. When I told my boyfriend my intention he had a fit saying we needed to make sure the bills were paid first (they are) and that we don't need to waste the money. Says the guy who buys new video games weekly; and that's fine. It's his money. He's been paying the bills by himself for two months. But at what point do I have a say over $10-15 that was meant as a gift directly to me? It's on his card and in his bank account, and it feels really shitty to just take it and use it, but when my dad began sending it he made it clear to me that it was only supposed to be for me so that I could have a little extra money of my own. But i never relayed that part to my boyfriend because I always assumed what's mine is ours and vice versa.

Yes I'm mad over beer money, which seems petty, but it's the principle of the thing.

So, AITA?

EDIT: 
I was trying to keep it short and sweet, and eliminated a few details.
It is not a joint bank account.
I lost my job 2 months ago; had some savings but they ran out. Before that I was the primary provider so, yes, I was hoping for a touch of slack on his part but in no way expected it.
I have a bank account; due to complications I haven't received an updated debit card, which is needed for Facebook. Didn't even consider PayPal as an option, but now I have one.
I'm in no way unappreciative of the support he has given me. I'm just baffled that a $10 gas station purchase evolved into this.
And, yes, we've been together for 8 years. Might not be married, but in sickness and in health, right? My hospitalization rendered me unable to work for a few weeks. The rest has been a diligent job search."
"AITA for being upset about my partner using a blanket? | Growing up my family travelled *a lot* 

We went Florida, New York, New Orlenes, Mexico, Paris, Ireland, Wales and Poland.

Wherever we went I got gifted a blanket by my parents, don't ask why.

I've *never* used them.

My partner knows I've never used them.


We recently had my MIL stay around and he gave her one of  my blankets, despite having blankets and duvets for guests to use.

I've told him that I found it rude that he used something that wasnt his especially since I've never used them.

He claims I'm an asshole for overreacting about blankets.

I don't think it matters what it was.

AITA?"
"AITA for not fully paying attention when my husband was sharing something important to him? | I am taking an online course and had an assignment due today at midnight. I was working on it in the living room where my husband was watching TV because we live in a small apartment and I have nowhere else to study.

It was 11:40pm and a plane goes over the building which my husband hears. It reminds him of 9/11 and he starts talking to me about his experience that day and how he remembers it and I stop working to talk to him about it. I quickly look at the time and realize that I only have about 15 minutes left to submit and I need to finish this paper quickly so I start typing the rest of my paper while also trying to tune into my husband.

He gets upset that I started typing again even though he knew full well my assignment was due and that I had been working at this for the past hour. 

He does this often. Somehow finds a way to tell me important things that he requires my undivided attention for at not the best times. I felt like he could have just waited to talk to me.

AITA?"
AITA for not going to a party that I wasn’t personally invited to? | So my friend had a party last night and I didn’t go. He called me this morning asking me if everything was ok. I said yeah he asked me why I didn’t go to the party. I told him because he didn’t invite me. He says he’s talked about the party for weeks in front of me and I knew I was invited. I told him that he personally texted others about it and asked them if they could help set up or bring stuff. He didn’t reach out to me to personally invite me or ask me to help in anyway so I figured I wasn’t invited. He told me he feels like I’m being childish about the whole thing? Our other friends agree with him and say I’m being vain and insane and an asshole for making this about me.
"AITA for dating a married man (31) even though they're enstranged? | I'm 19 and I met this super cute and attractive guy at my internship (he's the son of the ""owner"" of the company I should say) and he's the first guy I ever met that really cares about me and not just sees an attractive girl in me that he wants to lay on top of. I had that multiple times during my freshman year that I had dates with really cute guys but when it got more intimate and they knew I was a virgin and insecure they backed off or in one case it was all about it for him he even talked to his friends how keen he is on taking my v-card so this is just crazy and not want I want from a relationship. 

Now this guy is totally different, he's way more mature obviously and really cares about me and my character and my career plans it's just not describable how well he makes me feel. Now as I said in the title he's theoretically still married with two children, but as I said they don't love each other anymore sadly, but I still feel kind of sad meeting him at his house and am afraid of what could happen if his wife or children still could see me. Is it okay to date a guy that's that far into separating anyways or really not?

Sorry for the typo meant estranged obviously."
"AITA for yelling at a special needs student? | Background Info: 3 days ago I had to get my nose cauterized due to excessive nose bleeds. 

So yesterday I was playing 4-square in the gym (The usual) one of the kids (Who I always thought was a bit odd) threw the basketball at face as a “joke”. When it hit the floodgates opened getting blood everywhere, my clothes the ball, the floor everywhere and it hurt like hell. I swore at him,, partially in shock “What the fuck is wrong with you retard!” He cried an ran away to tell a teacher

Fast forward around 15 minutes and I’m in the counselors office. As it turned out, the kid that threw the ball had ADHD. I was sent home not only for what I did for what I did but also for the bleeding. The day after I got my nose cauterized again (Which in my opinion is very painful) and stayed home for the rest of the day.

Today when I went back to school I was for what I did. It makes me feel bad. I tried to apologize to the kid but he (No joke) Called me a dumb N-word (I’m black btw). I was outraged however this time I didn’t show it. 

So Reddit AITA?"
"AITA for telling my daughter (6.5) she's grounded if she pees her pants again at school? | First of all, I know that sounds like the biggest asshole thing ever. But.. I've never shamed her for it, but it was happening at least 1x a week and I just didn't know what else to do.

She's never been a bedwetter, no problems in pre-k or kindergarten. I asked her what was going on since she knows the potty drill. She said she doesn't like having to raise her hand to go. Sometimes the teacher just says ""Not right now"" without knowing what it's about, so the teacher came up with a special way to raise your hand that means BATHROOM NOW! (you just wiggle your hand while raising it). She just did not want to do the funny wiggle, she said it made her feel dumb..I said ""Isn't peeing your pants more embarrassing?"" She doesn't think anyone can tell (newsflash, honey...they can!) I told her she can get a bad rash or infection if she keeps it up....Still was having accidents.
 
I talked to her teacher and she says she has permission to go any time, no questions asked. I told my daughter she is special because she can just go without doing the silly hand thing. Should be all set, right? Nope, still having accidents.

 I took her to the doctor. No infection.  I tried everything he recommended. More fiber, more water, and making sure she goes before school. Still having accidents...

Nothing in our routine has changed, no big move, no new people or loss of any loved ones...nada.

I realize 1st grade is quite a leap. In preschool and kindergarten there were bathrooms in the classroom and you didnt need permission. I feel bad because I know it's just anxiety, but all I can do for that is reassure her that it's OK to speak up. . 

I've tried rewards for a whole clean week at school...didn't help.

I just felt like I had no more recourse. I told her there is absolutely no reason she should not be going to the toilet at school. I mean, she doesn't even have to ask anymore. 

 So I told her I will have to start taking privelages away at home. No TV, no games, just work for 5 days. . . 

**Ga-round-ed* *

So far it has worked. She was clean all last week and today. .

I just feel awful for threatening a 6 year old with anxiety. So go ahead and give me the big YTA!

-------------------------------------------------
Edited to add:

Seeing a psychologist is not off the table. I just know how it went for me at that age. I remember having to go at 5 for tantrums. I still remember it. I felt like there must be something wrong w me if I have to go talk to this doctor about all this trouble I'm causing. I am just hesitant about doing it now, since it seems to be the only issue she is having. I will absolutely consider it if it continues or if anything else comes up."
"AITA for wanting another dog, that attacked mine and wounded him, to be put down | Context

Moose, (husky) who is my fiancées and my dog, was playing with us and a few of his toys outside when Bolt (Pit-bull) came to have fun also. 

Things got territorial when bolt was jealous of a toy moose had and went into fight moose. Not a low scale fight either. I tackled moose and pulled him off as my fiancée pulled bolt back. Moose would sit next to me but bolt came back and gashed him on his leg causing a large laceration. 

We are at the vets now and I have cooled off but my first thoughts were to do anything to get rid of bolt. AITA"
"AITA for taking a nap in the middle of the day and leaving husband with the kids? | My husband and I have three kids all 9 and under. He works full time and I stay at home, although I'm about to start working soon. I've also picked up hours working side gigs and odd jobs to help make some extra money. 

Our kids have been taking turns being sick all week. Our youngest has reactive airways which, while not as serious as they used to be, still require round the clock breathing treatments. I'm responsible for 90% of childcare and all of the household chores. I know that it's what expected since he works full time but I'm just really really tired. 

Anyway yesterday I took a nap after putting our 3 yr old down for his which left my other two unsupervised with my husband. I think I also may be coming down with something. Unfortunately our toddler woke up early from his nap and I didn't hear him. Husband was nice enough to let me sleep half an hour after that but since then he has been really upset and giving me the cold shoulder. 

He says that it's unfair that I get to just nap while he had to watch the kids on his day off. I think it's not a big deal because it isn't a normal habit of mine? Also he mostly just played video games while the kids ran around the house apparently so I don't feel like he was overworked...

Tldr: i napped instead of watching the kids and my husband had to step in. AITA?

Edit: I did forget to add that he allowed me to make up for it by sleeping with him. I could make it better if I do that. I just wonder if it's something I have to make up for in the first place?"
"AITA for telling my wife she's selfish for refusing to make our son a non-vegan birthday cake | Update denied by mods.

My wife has been vegetarian-ish as long as I've known her (ten years), but last fall she made the leap to full vegan. I was (and am) very supportive of her not eating meat before the change and have been very supportive of her since then.

We have three kids aged 7 to 1. My wife and I agreed that, while veganism is the right way for ethically conscious adults, it currently does not meet the nutritional needs of growing children in the same way an omnivorous diet does. We've seen the horror stories of children and pets starving and dying at the hands of vegan parents and are staying far from that. Our agreement means our kids eat a regular omni diet and my wife doesn't have to prepare any meat. Simple.

My middle kid will be five next week and my wife is spearheading the whole event. Today she started trying out cake recipes. I'm usually the taster and provide feedback as honestly as I can. Tonight there was a cake cooling and she told me she'd let me try it as soon as it cooled and she'd made frosting.

I tried the cake. It was off. I was confused for a moment, then it hit me.

Me - ""Did you adapt this recipe to make it vegan?"" 

Her - ""Yeah I figured I needed to start now if I wanted to have something workable by the party.""

I put the cake down. ""Why are you making a vegan cake? None of the children are vegan.""

She became defensive. ""I wanted to make sure there were options, I don't know what everybody's diet is like.""

Me - ""Are you making a non-vegan cake?"" 

Her - ""No I just wanted to make something everybody could eat."" 

Me - ""You're the only vegan who will be at the party."" 

Her - ""You don't know that, other parents could be too."" 

Me - ""But none of the kids are."" 

Her - ""So what? I'm going to be at the party too."" 

Me - ""Right, but it's not your party and you're not a guest. You forcing everybody to eat vegan when it's not your birthday is extremely selfish.""

This turned into a fight. I'm an asshole, she's disconnected and selfish. She refuses to see how her refusing to make anything not vegan for our child's birthday isn't insane. Finally she told me that I should make the fucking cake and stormed out of the room and refuses to talk to me. She's set up shop in the guest room and I'm sleeping alone tonight.

I'll admit to saying petty shit as she walked away. ""Can you even hear yourself? ""Hey kids, the only cake is vegan, there are no alternatives. I'm not forcing veganism on you, but if you don't choose the vegan option then you get nothing. Happy birthday son.""""

I will make the cake, I don't have a problem with that. I'm not half as talented but I've done it before and I'll do my best. My son is starting kindergarten in the fall, I know he's nervous and I want him to feel confident and excited with all his friends around him.

AITA for telling my wife she's selfish for refusing to make our son a non-vegan birthday cake?

Edit: Seeing all of the responses to this post has made me take a hard look at my position. I still think it's dumb that she is refusing to consider a non-vegan cake, but all year our kids have gone to birthday parties and she's had to stand quietly aside, eating nothing, having no cake. I understand how ostracized she has felt and she just wants to be included. I'm going to apologize to her and help her make the best vegan cake as best I can. I'll make a non-vegan to go with it, it won't be good but it'll be there. I love my wife and this isn't the hill I want to die on.

Say what you want, but to me this is a NAH situation. Thanks for helping me come to my senses."
"AITA for refusing to make friends with my coworkers? | So I work at a place with quite a lot of people. At lunchtime the whole room is basically packed. It's generally a close knit type thing, and most people seem to be friends with each other. Me not so much. I don't sit with the others, i don't talk to them outside of working together, and I'm definitely NOT friends.

Basically, there's too much of a divide between me and the others. There's a clear demographic at my workplace, mid-20's to 40's, sociable and non-neurotypical. Then there's me, as standard as they come, young and with an active social life outside of work.

Basically, the people at this workplace are close-knit enough to go on work holidays together, I only work with others when necessary. I'm there to work, not to have fun. But apparently some people have complained to the boss that i don't sit with them and whatnot.

To clarify, I'm never rude to anyone, I make small talk if they initiate, but the bottom line is that I work there, I don't care about anything else there, I wanna work, make my money and go home. AITA for not wanting to be buddy-buddy with my workmates?"
"AITA for not wanting my husband and I to share a hotel room with his best friend? | My husband is the best man for a wedding we will be traveling out of state to later this month.  The bride and groom will also be traveling to this location, as it takes place in the brides hometown, where her family still lives.  Bride and groom will be staying with her family the week prior to the wedding.

My husband just mentioned to me that groom asked if he could stay with us the night before the wedding, and my husband said OK without checking with me.  I am not OK with this.   

AITA for insisting my husband tell the groom he cannot stay with us?


EDIT:  I want to say that I do want to take back my final question above.  I was angry when I wrote that and realized shortly after how awful that was.  Whats done is done and I absolutely DO NOT want to make the groom uncomfortable during his special time.  Seriously guys I get it.  

I AM upset though that my husband agreed to this without asking me, and I honestly believe this shouldn't have been asked of him us in the first place.  I also want to add some context below that will maybe help some of you stop thinking I am the devil in the flesh.

We are all in our late 40's, this grooms second marriage, grooms second destination wedding, and second time my husband has been the best man.  This is about the groom, who makes more than my husband and I combined, not wanting to pay for a hotel room that night.  That is all.  I am not keeping the two of them from hanging out and getting drunk and reminiscing, and neither of them are big drinkers.  I wasnt planning on locking my husband and myself in the room after the rehearsal dinner.  We of course would spend the rest of the evening with the groom, or they can do something without me, I am fine with either.  Contrary to what alot of you are assuming, I do like the groom and never stated otherwise.   I just feel at the end of the night that groom should be sleeping in his own room.  And this is NOT the same as having someone stay at your house, and in fact groom has stayed at our home.  This is about sharing a tiny living space with someone I am not very close with, and wanting my own space."
"AITA for telling my co-worker that her christmas biscuits weren't good when she asked for my honest opinion? | (Sorry for formating, on mobile)
I work at an office and I became good friends with one of my co-workers. Before christmas, she brought some biscuits, and they were bad. In my family we call these type of sweets ""happinesless"" (""örömtelen"" originally, doesn't translates well). Without sugar, flour, eggs, milk, fruits; anything that makes life happy. She knows that I'm sweet-thoothed, so she asked me:

-What do you think about my biscuits? Honsetly.
-They are strange.
-What do you mean?
-They are not that bad.
-But?
-Not that good either.

She went scilent. I didnt picked up on that I've offended her, but when I asked her about the food she brought for lunch (we used to eat lunch together), she said ""Why do you ask? So you can pick on that too?"", then went on that ""if someone brings gifts that she put a lot of work in it I should be more nice and greatfull"" and when I said sorry, she said ""Dont talk to me for some time, I need time to went"".  
This was on the 20th of december, and last wednesday was the first time she came into office. She still avoids me and only greets me coldly in the morning when we accidentally meet.
So reddit, was I the asshole? And what should I do? I miss our lunches, but I'm not sure I want them back if she is this easly offended.

Edit: I feel like I have to clarify that I didn't knew that they were made without anything before tasted them. 
And my problem with them wasn't that they weren't sweet. They just tasted bad and artificial. She used a lot of artificial sweeteners and some wierd flour I've never heared of.
I've tried to apologise, but she avoids me, and I dont want to send an email. That would feel impersonal."
"AITA for not letting my daughter’s boyfriend sleepover? | Throwaway account. I’m also new to this thread and am seeking some perspective, I do apologise if many similar situations have been brought up before. 

My daughter and her boyfriend are both 20, and have been together for over 1.5 years. BF is over at our house quite often, at least 4-5 times a week and everyone in the family is okay and used to this. Sometimes, he leaves the house at very late hours, around 1-3am. (They are both waiting to enter university and are working part-time, hence have quite a bit of free time these few months) My husband and I initially did not like that they were spending time in my daughter’s room behind closed doors, but it seems to be a long term relationship and we are okay with it now. 

However, we have a strict rule that he is not allowed to sleepover. A few months ago, my daughter asked if BF could sleepover and I firmly said No. She was visibly upset but did not pursue the matter, I assume because she could tell from my tone that I would not budge on this rule. She hasn’t brought it up because she respects our decision, but I’m sure she wishes this wasn’t a rule at all. They spend lots of time together anyway so it doesn’t seem like there’s even a need for him to sleepover? 

Anyway, she has now asked again and brought up the fact that she is about to go overseas for Uni in a few months, which means they will be long distance for many years. However, I still don’t see the need for him to stay the night and as far as I know, his parents are not okay with it either. But maybe I need more opinions. So AITA for not letting my daughter’s bf sleepover?"
"AITA for ignoring a girl I was suppose to help? | Ok, so in high school I was apart of a club that helped out the students in our school struggling with disabilities & mental illnesses among other problems, and our surrounding community. It involved a lot of volunteering, and then a lot of talking and mediating other students. 

I was apart of this mentor/mentee program and I was paired up with this girl who had some disabilities that prohibited her from learning, developing some social skills, among other things (they were very low forms and she was able to communicate pretty well, but she was in special ed classes as she had a hard time reading and writing)I was assigned to help her learn some social skills, and make some friends.

It mostly worked. I got her out of her shell a little bit and when I would walk into our classroom for the club she’d be talking to another student or sitting with someone in the cafeteria. I tried to keep our meetings and check ins a little more casual as I was trying to teach her how to deal with social situations and talk to people. This led her to believe that we were just best friends. And while she’s a sweet girl and funny, I don’t think I’d be her friend if I met her outside of this. Not to say that I would be mean to her but, we don’t have similar interests or really the same humor. 

For a while after I graduated she kept calling me in the summer and I had answered every couple of weeks, mostly because I felt bad because I knew she still didn’t have a lot of friends and she relied on me. I kept in contact for her for almost another year while I was in college and I think at the end of May I stopped answering her calls.

I feel like she needs to move on from me and the mentoring program and make more friends and I’ve become a crutch for her as whenever I would bring up if she had made any friends at school, she said she had me. So I hope from not talking to me she’ll make some more friends. I feel like I’m being mean but I dreaded having to talk to her every couple of weeks as she would kind of dump all of her problems on me and ask how I would fix them and it’s a lot as in school and even over the summer I’m very busy with volunteering, work, my family, and my own problems.

So, AITA for ignoring her calls and texts?"
"AITA for not being excited about a vacation with my parents and our 2 small children to Great Wolf Lodge? | My parents surprised us this Christmas with a vacation at GWL. The date was selected and assumed it would work for our schedule. The amount of effort to hire someone to watch our animals while we're gone, take time out of our schedule, and parent outside of our home does not seem like a vacation whatsoever. It would cost us a lot to eat out each meal for 2 days and would be completely draining trying to get a 3 and 2 year old to sleep in a hotel room with us. I see it as putting in all the work so my parents can take a few pictures and have their memories. The better gift would be THEY take the kids to GWL while Mom and Dad have a weekend off."
"WIBTA for giving my friend a “better” version of what his GF got him? | long time lurker, first time poster
obligatory “on mobile, i’m sorry” disclaimer. 

I (22F) had a rough 2019. Without going into detail, my mental health was at an all time low and I was struggling a lot. My three closest friends (early 20s M) really helped me through it. I genuinely do not know where I would be without them, they kept me going (pushed me to leave my house, made sure i ate and slept enough, etc) and I could never thank them enough. While I’m not in a great place, I’m doing a lot better now. 

I’m generally bad at gift giving and was struggling on what to get them. We didn’t do a gift exchange so there was no pressure but I really wanted to give them each something close to the heart. I eventually thought of making wooden boxes that could hold some stuff for a couple games we all play together, make it nice with carvings and such. I really think it’d be a cool project, and I want to keep it a surprise until it’s done (in the event that I fail spectacularly and it never sees the light of day haha). I’ve never done anything like it but I like a challenge and have a family friend with a woodshop who is willing to help me.  

Here’s my problem: a couple days ago, I was at one of the guys’“Liam’s” apartment and he mentioned how his GF had gotten him a nice plastic case for the same game. I had already started sketching my ideas and it never occurred to me that I may be stepping on toes. One of the guys is single, but the other two are in committed relationships. I’m friends with Liam’s girlfriend but have almost no relationship with the other guy’s girlfriend.

I know this would be a non issue if I was a guy but I’m not, so it’s something I have to think about. I am also single, and have very strong relationships with all three of them. I talk to all of them pretty much every single day (individually for the most part, but it’s not uncommon for us all to hang out). 

I really want to do this because these guys mean the world to me, but I do not want to send any weird signals or anything. Part of my plan is to give it to all three of them at the same time so it doesn’t come off as if I poured my soul into one person’s surprise custom gift. So WIBTA if I made and gave these boxes? I really don’t know if I’m overthinking this or if it’s coming off as weird.

EDIT: Important info, the boxes are for a collectable card game. The box that Liam’s gf got him could hold MAYBE half of what he has. So it’s not a replacement, but an addition. 

Also, the reason I’m posting is because I’ve never been in a serious long-term relationship, so I have no personal experience to relate or compare."
"AITA for wanting to be reminded of my nephews birthday? | My nephew turned six and I didn’t remember his birthday, but neither did any of us. My sister sent a group message to the whole family the day afterwards essentially saying that because we all forgot he went to bed feeling unloved and she’s disappointed in us. Then, she refused to answer any of our calls.


I just feel like instead of letting the day end with him feeling unloved, and then texting us the following day, she could’ve reminded us *on his birthday* and scolded us for needing a reminder. I feel really bad for him. I have had birthdays like that and I do love him and want him to know that. 


I haven’t brought that up yet though bc 1.) my sister is not answering calls and 2.) maybe ITA and this is totally my fault. She already has a rocky relationship with us as my parents have had a difficult time accepting she’s gay. Also, my nephew is adopted which may make him feel especially unwelcome and insecure - Im also adopted so I understand "
"AITA for seeing my wife on the nanny cam and confronting her about how she ""shuts off"" when she's parenting and nobody's watching? | My wife and I have twin little boys, three and a half years old. She's always a really engaged parent around me, and just recently I saw something really concerning.

We got these nanny cams for when we hire babysitters, just in case. It occasionally to keep an eye on the dogs when we're out. And we agreed to keep them off when it's just us.

We're able to see the live feed on our phones, plus the recordings are put on cloud storage for a time. But we've almost never used them.

At work yesterday I got a notification from the security camera app asking me to rate it on the app store. It was annoying, it wasn't the first time it sent me that, so I opened the app to see if there was a setting to disable it. And to my surprise there was a live feed from the living room onscreen. I'd thought that we'd disabled the cameras.

But in the feed, my wife was on her tablet with noise cancelling headphones on when the boys were playing kind of rough with each other. Something that they're not allowed to do, and she was just ignoring it.

I was concerned and decided to talk to her at night. But that afternoon I had the urge to check the app again, and the were eating unthawed breaded mozzarella sticks from the freezer box while my wife was FaceTiming someone and still wearing her noise cancelling headphones.

It was so bizarre and unexpected, I opened up the cloud storage and took a few looks at older videos throughout the week. And every time, she had her headphones on and was practically ignoring the kids. 

I went home and told her I wanted to talk, and said that I'd noticed somehow the cameras were left on and I was worried about her. She'd looked really checked-out and that was absolutely unlike her, was something the matter? 

She seemed defensive saying maybe she was just tired when I looked, and how did the camera get turned on anyway? She sure didn't do it.

I said I didn't know, but I also didn't think it was just a tired moment, I'd looked at the cloud storage and she'd been like that for the whole week it saved. 

She got upset with me for looking through a weeks of videos instead of coming to her right away when I'd noticed the camera was recording when it shouldn't be. She said I should have told her and not watched. 

I told her I wanted to talk about how she was doing, what was up, and she just shut down. Saying she was fine, and that she wasn't talking about shit that I had no right to be looking through.

I feel worried; it's like a switch seems to flip when she's alone with the kids versus when she knows someone is watching. She's so attentive and present when we're doing stuff as a family, or with family friends around. But it looked like she was 100 percent checked out when she thought nobody would see.

AITA for having watched the recordings and for still wanting to talk about it? She doesn't want to talk.

Edit to add... A lot of people are bringing up therapists, she actually goes to hers every week or two, and has since college. She doesn't always talk about what goes on in therapy though, she's often not in the mood to talk after"
"AITA for saying I preferred the younger sister when my friend tried to set me? | My friend Linda and i were at her place for her birthday party. We have been friends for a while and she has been wanting me to be in a relationship for a while.

She showed me a friend of hers instagram  [31f] , while I was scrolling through it she had a pic with her younger sister[24f] whom just looked like a younger hotter version of her. 

I asked about her if she was single. And she is like yes but she isn’t the one looking to date. I said I would prefer her younger sister.

Linda got super upset turns out that her friend asked about me in particular, and wanted to see if I was up. I didn’t know that until after the fact. I treated it just like real life tinder.

I feel like they are treating me as a mega asshole. Largely in part to her friends insecurity about being less attractive than her younger sister. But how am I supposed to know about that? If you ask me to judge someone based on pics I’m gonna choose the cuter one. I don’t know I feel like I got them triggered about their own relationship with getting older. I apologized afterwards but hasn’t done much "
"AITA for getting a coworker who’s children died fired? | I work with a women who’s 2 of 5 children died in a car crash. She was given 2 weeks of payed leave and then she returned to work. However, when she returned I had to do a assignment with her. The assignment was hard and meant for two people, but she didn’t help out at all. When I told her I was going to tell the boss, she told the boss that I wasn’t working and she was doing the assignment.

I was given a warning. She would get sidetracked a lot and she would gamble online a lot during work. She’d come in drunk a lot and yell at me. When I’d tell my boss, he’d say that she was just recovering from losing two kids. Plus he said I didn’t have evidence. 

Finally I decided to gather evidence. I recorded our conversations(aka yelling at me) and take photos of her off task. About 2 weeks after her paid two weeks off, I brought this to my boss, he was astonished! She was fired for verbal abuse and being off task. 

After all of this, some of my other coworkers came up to me and told me I am being a asshole. They also said that it was wrong of me to record our conversations and getting her fired after she lost two of her children.

So Reddit, AITA?

Edit: 
Wow, I got tons of mixed replies (NTA,ESH,YTA)."
AITA for not chasing after neighbor’s dog? | My next door neighbors have one of those stupid little chihuahuas that barks CONSTANTLY in a high pitched yelp. I cannot stand the MF. It got out of its yard the other day while I was shoveling my sidewalk and I saw it run it’s little fatso self down the street. I did not chase. Don’t know if they ever found him. AITA?
"AITA for taking a “drive slow” sign that was in the middle of the road? | I was driving in a neighborhood and one of the residents put one of [these signs](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcRZpF3yIoEWGxs-_sG87EStJqPW5hPUdprKnRiKcebrj4t_lt5avlO19wF53uM&usqp=CAY) directly in the middle of the road, to the point that I had to either drive the wrong way or drive on the shoulder to get around it. I stopped my car, put the sign in my car, then drove off so that I could throw it away when I got home. The owners of the sign were in their garage and they saw me taking it, and they started yelling at me and tried to run after my car, but I took off before they could reach me. Here’s my logic:

1. The sign was creating a hazard being in the middle of the road, which completely defeats the purpose

2. Any item in the middle of a road is garbage. I can’t just place, say, a cardboard box in the middle of the road, so I don’t think this sign should be any different. The owners of the sign forfeited their ownership by placing it where they did 

3. If I had simply moved the sign to near the sidewalk, they easily could have just moved it back"
"AITA for clicking my fingers around a kid. | unsure how to even word the title. 

so I (19f) babysit at night to make some extra cash, I make a decent amount of money and can do my uni assessments while the kids are asleep. 
I will occasionally babysit during the day when I do not have class as I like to try and make as much money as I can. 

for the past couple of months I have been on and off babysitting a family's 2 kids, a 2 year old boy and a 5 year old girl. 
I started to do something around the 2 year old that I found worked in getting him to do stuff for me. 

example...
If the 2 year old isn't going to the table to eat lunch I will click my fingers and point at the table and go ""eat"" he will then go and eat his food. 
so I will click my fingers and it will normally make him listen and do what I need him to do. 

I had taught myself to do that after I got myself a puppy so I was using a trick I used on my dog. 

the family i babysit for found out about it and when they realized it was a dog thing they got incredibly mad and accused me of treating the kids like dogs so I'm now not allowed to babysit. 

AITA?"
"AITA for keeping bacon in my fridge to feed my sick cat? My boyfriend hates it- we are both vegan. | My boyfriend and I are both vegan, we have been for maybe 6 years or so. I love him very much and most of our life values are in alignment. He is passionate about veganism from an ethical standpoint, I am more vegan for health. 

My 18 year old kitty is going to pass away soon. She is not ‘sick’ per se but the poor baby is just ready to cross the rainbow bridge and we took her to the vet a week ago because she’s started to soil herself and he said to expect that she won’t make the next few weeks. 

He told us to feel free to spoil her as much as we like, and said If she has an appetite to feel free to give her her favorite treats etc. My baby girl has indeed started to lose her appetite. 

I knew from previous experience before I was vegan I would feed her bacon as a treat and she went *nuts* for it. Out of desperation I picked up some bacon and cooked it for her and she went absolutely bonkers trying to get to the bacon. She gobbled it down and has been interested in food again since, but she keeps meowing for more bacon everytime I go to the fridge. 

My bf loves my cat dearly but he is telling me I’m being cruel by a) feeding her super fatty food (despite the vet telling us BOTH she can basically have what she likes as she’s on her last legs) and b) I’m contributing to the suffering of animals by purchasing bacon. C) he is pissed because the bacon is kept amongst our other things in the fridge and it makes him upset and sick to see it there. 

Something I will admit I am PROBABLY the asshole for is that I used our shared cooking utensils and pan to cook the bacon which he was disgusted by. I didn’t feel good doing it myself and I’ve promised I washed everything thoroughly *and* replaced the sponge I used to clean the bacon fat away. He said that the whole house stinks of bacon and it’s making him sick, and also said that he is upset at the thought of losing kitty but there was no need to abandon our principles.

He has been giving her her usual cat treats etc (she eats vegan- YES it’s safe, we buy from our vet and she’s been eating it for years, it has taurine in there for her, no criticism please) and she has been eating those (nibbling really) so I do see his point. However I’m heartbroken and just trying to give my best friend a beautiful send off.

Edit: thank you for the replies everybody about vegan cat food not being safe. I know this isn’t the place to talk about it but I won’t be getting another cat, because it wasn’t my insistence to feed her vegan in the first place. I did some more reading last night and out of pure guilt I got her some gourmet kitty food this morning which she wolfed down. My boyfriend is even more pissed at me but you know what, you guys are right. My cat deserves this."
"WIBTA for paying one child's university tuition but not the other? | I (54f) have two children, a boy and a girl. When they were born, my husband and I were quite poor, but it had always been one of our dreams to let our children graduate from university without any debt. When our youngest was about 7 my husband I started making significantly more than we did before.

Our son has always been a prickly child. He'd get in fights at school and believed that if someone doesn't agree with what he said it was a personal attack against him. When he turned 18, we almost had enough saved for his tuition. We spoke to him and told him that we couldn't afford it at the time, but if he was willing to wait one year before going we could pay for everything - tuition, accommodation etc.

He said he wanted to go with his friends, took out a student loan and went that year. I tried to talk him out of it, saying that it wasn't worth plunging himself into thousands of pounds of debt when he had a better option. We got in a fight, he said I didn't trust him enough to make adult decisions and left.

Our relationship has cooled since then. He hasn't come home for holidays or called. I've tried reaching out to him, but he wouldn't answer. Now my youngest is 18 and it's her first year in university. My husband and I are paying for everything.

Our son has recently reached out to us. He has just finished his masters. He's in a lot of debt and asked me to pay it off since it's only fair because I'm paying for my daughter's education. I'm a bit bitter, since this is the first time he's contacted me in years and he's asking for money.

My husband is telling me to brush it off since we can afford it and that we shouldn't hold a stupid decision he made at 18 against him.

EDIT: I am British. Yes, I did have medical debt because I had to go private. My son did not study in the UK. He went abroad and got a loan abroad. I used pounds because I'm more familiar with it. When he applied, he applied for the total cost of his education - which at the time was for his undergraduate. Now it includes his masters as well. 

To everyone saying why I couldn't pay for him after the first year, it was very hard to work out those details because I couldn't contact him. "
"AITA for reporting my neighbor putting a huge gun in their car? | Witnessed my neighbor take out a huge rifle AR type gun and put it into car. He seemed nervous/determined and it left me with a very bad feeling. Also, it seemed odd that he would be holding it like he was and with not zipper case or case/box. 

I reported what I had seen. I thought that if something bad were to happen and I did not say anything I would feel responsible. 

My boyfriend says that by me reporting it I could be ruining this guys life. I feel like if he is using and owning it legally then he will be fine and it's better to be safe than sorry. 

AITA?

EDIT: This happened in Vegas. It's not uncommon to see people with guns..on their hip. I am not reporting any person with a gun. The man was holding it and walking with it at his side sort of moving it back and forth as he walked quickly and was so focused on the car he didnt notice me passing him. It seemed out of the ordinary."
"AITA if I am upset a date didn't go how I expected it to? | Context


---


Me: 20 M


Her: 18 F


Met a girl in a bar and we hit it off. She had to leave because she had work the next day, nothing happened then apart from getting her number. Text a little bit that night and over the next couple days. The text conversation seemed to be going alright. I do not like talking over text and would much prefer to talk to someone in person or in a call. 


I mention I am seeing a movie and ask if she would like to accompany me. She declines saying she is busy but counters with an alternative to see a exhibition at a local planetarium on the weekend. The exhibition is a sciency edutainment short about time and space. Sounded fun and I was able to move some things so I could be free then so I agreed. Exhibition only goes for 40 minutes and I believed the possibility would be there to do something afterwards if it was going alright because it was very early in the night. We continue talking until the day of the exhibition. She refuses my offer of a lift there.


I believe this is a date. I have never been on a date before.


---


The Date


---


I arrive at the time we agreed which was about ~20 minutes before the exhibition started. I am nervous but believe I am handling the nerves well. We kill the 20 minutes having a chat about some of the stuff in the museum part of the planetarium and ourselves. Pay the entrance fee separately. Go into the exhibition where we can no longer talk. Watch the short. 


As we are leaving we are chatting still, but she has got Uber up on her phone and seems to be in the process of booking a ride. I ask her what her plans for the rest of the night where. She responds with she has to go home because her brother wants her to. I enquire more about this with something along the lines of ""can't you do what you want to do?"". She says something like ""my parents are away and my older brother is looking after me because my parents asked him to"". I offer her a lift home and she refuses. We chat for 5 minutes while I wait with her for her Uber to arrive. Her Uber arrives and she gets in and says this something like ""this was great, we should do something again"".


I walk to my car very confused about what just happened and feel like she wasn't into me and was just saying platitudes. I console in a close friend who has more experience with dating who agrees it is confusing but she probably isn't into me.


Have a sad drive home. Get home and about half an hour later I get a text from her that reads ""Hey! Didn't want to text you while you where driving 😜 tonight was fun!!""


I decide to be honest: ""Yeah the show was pretty good. The night didn't go how I expected it to though""


Her: ""What do you mean? 😁""


Her: ""Haha that's life for ya""


Me: ""I didn't think after it finished that you would go home immediately but it's cool""


Her: ""Well I am tired af from work 😂""


Her: ""Also my family just care about me a lot and want me to be safe""


I didn't respond after that.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who responded with their verdict and advice. Love you all. I will use this experience to improve myself, regardless of how it goes with this girl."
"AITA for asking my girlfriend to leave if she’s going to be unpleasant towards my daughter? | UPDATE; will be arranging to visit my daughter at her mothers until my girlfriend feels well enough to handle visits from my daughter, I’m also going to look into grief counselling for the both of us.


I (31M) have been with my girlfriend (Claire) for 2 years, 3 in January

I’ve got a 4 year old with an ex, we have her every other week.

Claire got pregnant 8 months ago, which is why we made the choice to move in with each other, 5 months into the pregnancy she gave birth, the baby didn’t make it.

Claire hasn’t been the same since which  while I   don’t fully understand, it was my baby too.

Claire has been in therapy since to help her grieve.

When my daughter came over to visit last, she drew on the wall which I completely understand but Claire made a point of sending her up to her bedroom for 90 minutes.

She continues making snide remarks towards my daughters mother and is over all really strict on my daughter, any toe out of line it’s straight to her bedroom 

Claire suggested we don’t have my daughter for a week until we’ve grieved properly and maybe stick to weekends and visiting her after school until then.

I told her if she continues doing this and continues being spiteful that she can leave, she is in no way priority over my daughter?

I understand her grief, I do.

She’s obviously calling me an AH 

AITA?"
"AITA for locking myself in with my baby? | I know this seems sucky at best. But I think I have good reasons. 
 
My amazing wife just gave birth two weeks ago. It's been an amazing journey, and really made us closer than ever.
 
Ever since Jay was born, my wife would almost never let me hold him. I hold him for a couple seconds, then she says that he wants to be fed. 
 
Other times she just carefully snatches him from my hands. I have said multiple times for her to stop, but she hasn't. I just want to hold him for more than a couple seconds.
 
While we were downstairs and cooking, we heard Jay start to cry. I litterally run to the room, lock the door, and start to feed him from a bottle. Then, my wife starts to cry outside the door. I truly feel sorry for her, but I need to hold him for a while also. 
 
AITA?"
"AITA for being nice to other people (and mean to my GF)? | Me (24m) and my gf (24f) have been in a great relationship for two years. Life with her is a bliss, except for one thing. Due to the cultures we grew up in, I care a lot about other people and want to be nice to everyone and go on in my life without being a problem to others. Meanwhile, my gf couldn't care less about other people and always does things that make her comfortable, even if it would make others uncomfortable.

For example, many times we have walked past a restaurant, and she slows down or stops to stare inside of the food people are eating. Usually people are sitting by the window and look little uncomfortable when she does that. I feel uncomfortable too, especially is she fully stops. I tell her that she shouldn't stare so much, other people might find it uncomfortable, but she says she does whatever she wants.

She also doesn't care about her surroundings. She walks on the bike lanes (not on purpose) and I always have to tell her to walk on the right side of the road or watch out if some bikes or big groups of people are coming. 

She might watch some videos or play music quite loud until late and around 9-10pm I have to tell her to turn it down because the neighbors might be sleeping. She might also want to start the laundry machine in the evening, and gets mad at me if I say we should do it tomorrow because it's quite loud for neighbors. She says she doesn't care.

The last thing was today when we were walking across a big street. There were no cars coming so we just crossed the lights even though they were red. However, my playful girlfriend thought it's fun to press all the buttons as we walk past them, causing the crossing's lights turn red for the drivers, and green for us. But we had already crossed the road. So now there were couple cars that had to stop at the lights even though no one was walking across the road. I told my girlfriend she shouldn't do that, because now the drivers have to wait for nothing. She got mad and said I don't like anything she does and always tell her what to do and not to do. 

I just care about other people and feel uncomfortable if they suffer or have to wait because of something I did. I might sound little blunt telling my girlfriend what to do or not, but I never force her to do anything. Most of the time I even try to sound not serious but happy and just slip in the conversation she probably shouldn't do something, but she still gets offended. On the other hand she says she feel uncomfortable with too many rules and if she can't do whatever she likes. 

AITA? "
"AITA for donating a present I got for my sister? | So I was on my way to my mum and 16 yr old sisters house when I stopped at target and saw this makeup pallet my sister won’t stop talking about on sale. Figured I’d be a good big sister and bought it for her. When I gave it her she said ‘thank you! But I actually bought it for myself yesterday. I finally saved up enough money’ and left it on the kitchen table. 

As I was leaving I grabbed it because after I was going to volunteer at the woman’s shelter and figured they would love some new makeup since my sister didn’t need it anymore. My sister called me today asking where the pallet was and I told her I gave it to the women and she said that it wasn’t my place and it was her gift and she was planning on selling it to get the money she bought hers for back. 

AITA for taking it and donating it?"
"AITA for refusing to pay for a bra my dog chewed up | I (30’s F) have a roommate (late 20’s f) and we share a mutual friend (30’s f). Roommate and friend are best friends, where I’m not as close with mutual friend. I also have 2 dogs Barry (1) and Kennedy (10 years). Barry is a puppy and he likes to chew on socks, panties, and stuffed toys. This is no secret. I’m obviously trying to break him from it but he doesn’t do it very often since roommate and I don’t leave our things lying around. Mutual friend is at my house all the fucking time (which is a whole other issue ) and is also aware that Barry goes nuts on clothing items. It’s not a secret.  Mutual friend sent me a text today with a picture of her bra and it had been chewed up by Barry the asshole. She said she left the bra in her purse, which was on the couch, and she left the house with roommate to go to the store. I basically told her that I was sorry and it sucks but she knows that she can’t leave clothing items around him.  He’s not even allowed to have stuffed animals because he destroys the shit out of them. It was a $70 bra and I feel bad but I feel like it was ultimately her fault. 

AITA?

ETA: the purse isn’t a purse that is zipped. It’s an open bag. No zipper. She stays the night at my house so it’s big enough to fit clothing items. Like an overnight bag.

ETA2: the dog is usually crated when no one is home . Roommate didn’t work during the day today and they left the dogs out when they ran to the store.

ETA3: the dogs are allowed on the couch. And, yes, Barry is untrained in this area. He has horrible separation anxiety and he was doing it before I adopted him. It’s an issue he’s had and it’s not like I let him just go nuts. It’s one of the reasons he’s crated when left alone."
"AITA for exposing my little brother's offensive TikTok videos to our parents? | I (17) have a little brother (13) who has a TikTok (like all kids these days I guess). My parents gave him his own phone when he was 11, but he's only just been allowed to have his own social media that isn't monitored by our parents, meaning that they don't have his account passwords anymore (they did from 11-13) or his phone password, but he is expected to let them in if there's reason for them to. 

I have been following my little brother on TikTok since he made his account. He asked me to make an account to follow him to get more attention, so I did. I occasionally check in on his account to make sure he's all good. I thought he was, but he's recently started making offensive and dumb content. 

My brother used to be obsessed with a YouTuber called Jaystation, who uploads videos to scare kids where he pretends to contact dead celebrities, pretends to do dumb 3am challenges, etc. My brother realised these videos were fake, but he's also figured out that this is a good way to get followers. 

He's been making videos where he pretends to contact dead celebrities, such as Mac Miller, Michael Jackson, and a bunch of other high profile deaths. I think this is really disgusting and immoral. I told him he needs to stop, and he basically laughed in my face. So I told our parents. They demanded he showed them his phone, and he didn't, so they demanded I showed them the videos on my phone, which I did. They were horrified and have made him delete his account (he had like 8k followers) and he's been banned from having his phone for two weeks. 

My brother know isn't talking to me at all. He's furious and he thinks I did something dramatic because he is just scaring kids for clout. I told him it's still disrespectful and gross, but we're not getting anywhere. AITA?"
"AITA for Firing My Hair Stylist? | I have been going to the same hair stylist for about three years now. I LOVE the salon, but the owner who did my hair for my wedding is usually booked up for months. I had another lady I really liked for a few years, but she moved, so I got my current stylist. I do like her, but I am pretty low maintenance and I don't expect much. I have really long hair, and I just go in for a trim every few months. I am always on time or early, and I always tip 20%.  

My stylist doesn't really treat me like a priority client. Sure, she does what I ask, but she will answer texts, get super distracted, etc. during my cut. 

At my last appointment a few months ago, I made an early December appointment, but about a month before that appointment, I realized I had made another appoint that would clash. I immediately text her to reschedule. She was fine with that and moved me to yesterday. I thought it was weird that I didn't get a notification my appointment was changed, but I assumed she put it in her calendar. I text her on Monday night to make sure we were still on for Friday, and she said yes. 

Yesterday she texts me at 3:30 p.m. (my appointment was at 4) asking if I can come in at 5 instead. I had a party to go to, so it was impossible to make that. She then says she's backed up and would be able to do a dry cut but no washing or styling. Mind you, there was no apology or anything like that; her message was very terse. I said I'd rather just cancel because I hadn't washed my hair in days as I thought I'd be getting it done at the salon and want the full thing when I go in. She said she would text me back immediately after her appointments and reschedule. She never did.

I text her this morning asking when we can schedule, and I am still waiting for a reply hours later.

AITA for firing her and going to another salon? This was just a one-time thing, but I feel like her reaction to the situation says a lot about how she values me as a client. "
"AITA for not loving my stepkids as much as my daughter? | I've (34F) been married to my husband for 2 years, together for 4. He has two children,  13 and 12, and 1 have a daughter, 8. 

When I met the kids, they were in a disadvantaged situation. My husband was a single dad who worked full time, a bit out of his depth and relied on his mother for help. She spoiled the kids for attention more than anything. 

After I came along, I used money from inheritance to help my husband move into a better neighbourhood. The kids go to a much better school, where it was discovered they were two years (!!) behind! Their ADHD was discovered and treated. Both kids caught up in a year. When the kids are with us (50/50 custody for all kids)  I mostly care for them. The kids have a healthier diet, a better sleep schedule, and  a better control over technology. 

The kids hated all these changes. I don't blame them. In the kids eyes, they all suck. They fought me, argued, and tried to call cps for abuse to try and live with their mother. (She 100% supports me and worked with me to make these changes, and has implemented some of them in her home.) I love these kids and will support them and give them the best future I can. 

BUT... I love my daughter more. I can't help it. Looking at her sends different chemicals in my brain than my other kids. Its hard wired. Maybe it would be different they were smaller when i met them. Whatever it is, my lizard brain won't love them the same way. They have the same opportunities now. The same food. The same chores. The same punishments for wrongdoings. 

My husband complains that I should love them the same full stop. Biology be damned. He claims it affects my parenting, and that I yell at his kids more. I admit I have more patience with my daughter, but the kids are all different, and I try my best to give all of them the best life. 

Aita for loving my kids diffently? 

Ps the kids don't know I feel this way. My stepkids have tried to trick me to saying my daughter is the favourite, so I say ""it's the dog. He never talks back"" lol."
"AITA for not taking my son when it wasn’t my time? | Background info: My ex tried to use me for money, I broke up with her but continued to be in my sons life, she tried to not allow me to do so, we went to court and I have my son every two weeks on the weekends. I am not a deadbeat dad, I pay for his daycare and clothes. I’m not complaining about doing these things but I just want to show y’all that I do take care of my son. I will add that my depression probably played a part in this 

To paint a better picture of my relationship with my son, I make us breakfast on the weekends, we go to the movies Saturday, and then Sunday we usually just build things or go play in the snow for awhile. Last week we went to the zoo three days in a row lol

Problem: I had an extra day off(normally I work 7 days a week) and wanted to spend it relaxing, I took this day off because i was burnt out from working morning and nights every single day. I posted something on my sc along the lines of “first day off in a couple of months, gonna enjoy this”. 30 minutes later my ex shows up, son in hand, convo goes like this 

Ex: “I want you to watch Neal”

Me: “is it an emergency?”

Ex: “No, ___ invited me to hang out” 

Me: “You can’t take him to daycare or take you with you?”

Ex: “I saw you were available so I decided to drop Neal off to you”

We argued for a bit and she ended up taking him to daycare. I pay for daycare for this reason, for her to have a safe place for him when she cannot watch him. I offered to have my mother watch him(I live with her because I’m saving for a house), she declined and wanted me specifically to watch him. I told her I couldn’t because my mind wasn’t right and I didn’t want to yell at him unnecessarily(terrible 2’s are a thing). Any other time I would’ve taken him in a heartbeat, but he shouldn’t have to be stuck with a grumpy dad. 

I’ve been getting hate messages from her family/friends about how much of a bad dad I am, I’m an asshole, don’t deserve my son, etc. 

Tell me reddit, AITA? 


TLDR: I was burnt out and grumpy from work so I took a day off, ex tried to get me to take my son outside of our schedule, I said no, and am now getting hate mail.

Edit; I need to clear this up real quick, my son was playing in my room during this conversation. I would never have that type of conversation around him.

"AITA for getting upset that my pregnant wife wet the bed? | Context: my (M24) wife (F24) is pregnant with our second son. She has been diagnosed with hyperemis (extreme pregnancy nausea) she usually gets quite sick and throws up quite often. Sometimes the barfing gets so intense that she sometimes wets herself, but that happens and I assure it's not a issue.

This morning she sat on the side I usually sleep on and then threw up and wet most part of my side where I have my head. She didn't let me know until I went to have quick laydown and suddenly lied in a pisspuddle in the bed. I got quite angry at her and called her childish for not letting me know so I could wash it instantly to prevent the smell and such. I have multiple times before fixed it for her since I know she doesn't always  have the energy and I take most of the chores for her to let her rest.

Now she is giving ME! The silent treatment and being angry at me for being upset she let the bed be soaking for hours and seemingly not giving me notice so I could fix it.

So AITA here?

Edit: We talked it out now and she had planned to rather deal with it when me and our son was out during the day to clean it properly, so we drew the line there and she would try to avoid being embarrassed about it in the future."
"WIBTA for confronting my GF over a dress she bought | Context: Me (26m) and my GF (26f) have a wonderful life together, moved in, own a dog, all of that. However, we are both at the start of our careers and as such don't have the most stable finances. Add to this the fact that I recently had a medical condition that required us both to take some time off work, and we are more or less living paycheck to paycheck. But, I come from money and have always used that to buoy our situation (covering her rent if she's short, getting nice stuff for her or the house, paying our vet bills, etc.). Never the less, she is always stressed about money to the point of it making her physically anxious.

Today, she had planned on going thrift shopping (specifically only thrift shopping was mentioned. This is important) with a friend, but due to the aforementioned time off she didn't have much in her account. She said she would go and just not buy anything, but I know that this makes her feel left out and anxious. I offered to let her take my credit card, and she accepted. Later, she called me saying that she got a dress and was thinking of returning it. I told not to, thinking that she always stresses after almost any purchase. She also has some body image issues and frequently feels bad about her clothes which causes her more shopping stress. I assumed her desire to return the dress was related to this.

Later the same evening, I'm doing some banking online and notice my credit card statement is much larger than I anticipated. I check it and see that there is almost 100 dollars in charges from a couple of upscale clothing stores in town, and nothing from any thrift store.

Here's the thing. If she had told me that they had changed from thrift shopping to an upscale place, I would have told her to go for it! Like I said, I have the money to cover it, and I like it when she can feel good about getting something new that she wouldn't normally be able to afford. At the same time, I can't help but feel a little taken advantage of.  I don't want to make her feel guilty or return the clothes or feel bad every time she looks at them, but I want her to know that I don't feel great about the way the whole thing shook out.

WIBTA if I talked to her about using my card like that even though I know it might ruin the evening and the clothes for her?"
"AITA for telling my son and his husband that it’s disrespectful to speak language I don’t understand | My son(25) and his partner(20) are staying at my house for a week. My son’s partner is French, but he can speak English, he just has an accent. Since he got there he has said few sentences in English. He mainly talks French.  

Yesterday we were all in living room, they started talking, French of course. I stopped them and nicely told them that I find it disrespectful that they’re speaking language I don’t understand and excluding me from conversation. They both stopped talking, my son’s husband went upstairs pretty soon after that. My son told me that I was making big deal out of nothing and making everyone feel awkward.

Edit/update: I understood everyone’s point. I talked to them and apologized for making them feel awkward. My son’s husband also apologized and said that he doesn’t speak English often because it’s hard to get his thoughts across and he’s insecure about his accent, but he said he’ll try more, so everything’s good between us."
"AITA: I got an innocent lady sacked from her job by lying to her and telling her the landlord said she couldn't pay me back my £500 deposit. | This was about 10 years ago, me and a friend shared a house for a job we had away from home. We agreed with the landlord that we would pay a week in advance so we could have a rolling contract week by week. He also wanted a £500 deposit plus the rent was higher doing it this way and in cash so he could avoid the tax.

The place looked ok but after a few days we had no hot water, the toilets kept blocking and the place started to smell and then we seen our first rat!!!!. We was there for less than two weeks, I rang the landlord who apologized and said he had another property for us and he would meet us the next day to take us there.

So the next day we're stood there like a pair of lemons outside the house with all our stuff  waiting for the landlord to turn up, he never did. I rang him and asked what was happening his words to me was ""you can stay there or you can leave either way it's not my problem"". It come out of nowhere he was fine the day before. I chose leave and demanded our deposit back, he obviously refused.

After a heated discussion he just out the phone down on me and wouldn't answer anymore. I realised that we had'nt payed the lady who collects the rent but everyone else in his other properties would have. She lived on the same street so I just went and knocked, she was alone with her two children. I told her that the landlord had asked me to come over to collect the £500 deposit. She said she would have to ask him first, I said not a problem go for it.

She rang him and asked him about the money I didn't hear his responce but she handed me the phone and he just started to call me everything under the sun. Now I was in this ladies house on her phone with her children present so I wasn't about to lose my shit infront of them. Instead I just nodded saying ""yeah, yeah ok"" and just chuckling a little now and again. I ended with a laugh like he said something funny and said ""no worries mate we can do the paperwork tomorrow"" and put the phone down.

After that I kept hold of her phone and told her that he said it was fine to get it of her and I can see him tomorrow. She was clearly confused but went and got me the money anyway. The whole time I kept hold of her phone turning it of as he rang back. I got my money and left. 

I never heard from the landlord after that he never come rang me but someone in work told me that the lady lost her job for giving me the cash. I went round to see her and her husband was there, she was clearly upset and I felt terrible. I spoke to her husband and explained the situation and explained I didn't want this to happen. I offered to ring the landlord and try and get her job back but they said it wouldn't help. I ended up offering them a few hundred pounds, it in no way would have covered the wages she lost but it's all I had. I felt like an absolute bastard after that."
"AITA: I refused to go out in the rain and get carts at my job because they only send me to spare the females having to get wet and cold. | I work at your typical large chain retail store. Every single night that I close they send me out to get the carts up for the night. They blatantly have said multiple times Send him out he is the only guy we have up here and it’s cold outside. This last time it was pouring rain and was relatively chilly out, and I refused to go out and have to spend the last two hours of my shift walking around in wet shoes simply because I’m the only male there. The women that I work with are payed equal to me and have the physical capability to do this part of the job, so I think it is fair to ask them to go do this task. AITA for thinking that this isn’t fair or right?"
"AITA for going to (and staying in) the bathroom when my moms boyfriend wouldn’t stop talking? | My wife and I stay in my mother’s house two nights per week because we have to be at an office nearby (we work together). 

My wife and I had a long day at office, came home and did some final catch up work. Ordered delivery and finally sat down to eat and enjoy and unwind together in kitchen when my mother and her Bf came back from their dinner. They were pleasant, barely tipsy, and happy to see us. The Bf, though, bless him, seriously can go on for 30 mins uninterrupted. My mother looked at me a little embarrassed. 

I didn’t want to ask him for some time to eat in peace (on top of it he was talking about some invasive medical checkups he just had)... besides it’s not even my house! We are guests there. 

So... I came here, to the toilet. To reddit in peace and let him run out. He’s still talking I can hear. I can stay here for 30 mins. So I’m wondering... AITA? If so, to him, my mom, or my wife, who is stuck there? (That’s her opinion... I’ve done it before... she is free to use the other bathroom!)"
"AITA for not wanting my fiancé to go to dinner with her boss? | I'm basically at the point of breaking off me relationship with my fiancé because I'm so frustrated by this whole thing. I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. 

Been with fiancé for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile ""we get your DUI charges dropped!"" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. 

So right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:

- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. 

- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. 

- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. 

- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. 

- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's ""biggest year ever"" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says ""aren't you proud of me!"" 


- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says ""hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!"" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him ""that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me."" Boss replies back in seconds ""sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!"" 

My fiancé looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says ""see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service."" 

I'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me ""hoarding evidence"" like this is an example of how I'm a ""controlling asshole"" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. 

She told me over and over again ""he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!"" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. 

She locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. 

I don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.

 AITA?

Edit: it's 5:30 here, car service picked her up at 5:15. I guess it's up to fate now if I'm a controlling asshole or if she didn't see it whatever is coming coming.

Edit 2: she just got home and said only ""I don't want to fucking talk about it"" and she's back talking to who I assume is her sister. I'm defying my every desire to eves drop so I don't know what happened. It's only 8:45 so I don't think anything super crazy happened. I'm just glad she's home. If it's appropriate, I'll update again when I know more.

Edif3: this really doesn’t pertain to aita anymore rather just people asking for an update...she gets to dinner and it’s just she, coworker and boss in a private dining room at hotel. Boss says strait up hes banging other girl and wants fiancé to join them. Has “understanding” with his wife and says he can do amazing things for fiancé. Fiancé is pissed she didn’t see this coming, but she’s still pissed at me for being controlling. She’s not happy at all and talking about breaking up. Sucks All around but I’m relieved she’s safe. Just giving her some space for a while."
"AITA for not wanting to bring a dish to a 200 person potluck wedding? | One of my cousins is getting married, and she wants/needs to do her food potluck. That's less of an issue for a small wedding, but there will be an estimated 200 people at this wedding. Of course, the wedding party has already claimed the easier things like plates, napkins, drinks, and rolls.

**Every independent household** is ""required"" to bring a dish for all guests. I'm technically an independent household because I live in my own place, but I live in a small apartment with roommates. I can't wrap my head around the logistics of making food for that many people. I've never made food for more than 6, and usually I'm cooking for one. 

1. I don't really have the ability to cook that much at once with my kitchen equipment, so I'd have to cook it in batches and somehow combine it later (and transport it somehow).

2. I can't really afford to make food for that many. I could do a simple pasta with red sauce, but they need it to be a ""filling dish"" aka have meat and/or cheese. I'm not a vegan or anything, but I can't afford to feed hundreds meat. I had the idea of adding lentils or making the sauce a cream sauce, but that's still not good enough. My estimates with my ""inferior"" dish are about $55, which is still a lot for me, but adding beef or chicken adds $75 to that, which is unreasonable for me.

3. I don't really have time to do all of this. My fridge is small and I share it with other people, so I'd basically have to do all this the day before, which not only a work day, but I'd also have to do all this and immediately leave for the wedding. 

Now, I could get bins from the dollar store, but these methods raise the risk of the food going bad. I'm willing to not eat anything at this wedding, I have my doubts that this won't end in food poisoning anyway. They're asking for gifts too of course, and I could give more if I didn't bring food.

**Edit:**

My estimates are based on Aldi prices, and the estimate that I'd need 25 pounds of pasta, 20-24 jars of sauce, and a bag of lentils. It's possible that I would need more and my estimates are low.

**Edit 2:**

This is BY HOUSEHOLD. Every household must make a dish to feed 200. It gets confusing because I'm a household of 1 (technically) but most of them are 6-10 people. I've asked the bride directly."
"AITA For Wanting to Break-Up With My Consistently Sad [Depressed?] GF? | TLDR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

I've been dating this girl for three years.  In the beginning it was cute she had a lot of problems and I was her ""savior."" I admit I may have made her more reliant on me than was necessary. She hated the school she was going to and complained that her life sucked and ""nothing ever works out for her."" Me being an eternal optimist decided to take up the challenge and see what I could do.

&#x200B;

Well, things were good for a while but with each problem that was solved, a new one appeared to surface. Her childhood didn't help either since apparently she was bullied and her dad cheated on her mom. However, other than that she had a financially stable and secure household with her parents providing her whatever she needed - perhaps she was even a bit spoiled.

&#x200B;

I saw a couple warning signs in the beginning which can be summed up to an entitled attitude e.g. if we went on vacation the hotel that I booked was maybe not fancy enough, I attributed these feelings to her well-off upbringing and hoped with time, reality and expectations would converge.

&#x200B;

After college, she couldn't get a job at desired location and was pretty sad about that for a while. She did get in the following year with that hiring cycle. After starting to work, she complained that she is naturally slow (which I admit) and her superiors want her to work faster so hence she would be reprimanded. So from now, not having a job in her desired location she goes from having that not to not liking it since she's yelled at for not being efficient enough.

&#x200B;

Throughout all this, she says she doesn't like her career field and would like to switch, when asked what she wants to do instead she's pretty lost and unsure. Currently, she's working in an Asian country were work is demanding and believes going to the US would make her life easier. As a caveat, I'm American and agree her work environment sucks and would be better in the US (less yelling/demanding) but am afraid after this is solved, some other problem will come up.

&#x200B;

Three years isn't a short time, the intent was to marry but I feel her consistent depressive attitude may make me very unhappy in the future.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Eternal optimist dating serial pessimist, AITA for wanting to break-up after three years for failing to ""make her happy.""

&#x200B;

Edit: To provide more info, I moved countries to be with this person and lost lots of job opportunities. Everything was done in response to ""what will make you happy"" questions. Maybe I need to see a therapist but I can't bare to see people sad around me and feel a need to help them. I suggested counseling and after pleading for 6 months she finally went after essentially I asked for a break-up. Earlier breakups were met with threats of suicide. She keeps on saying how her therapist said she should think about what keeps her happy and she stresses that it's me which makes me feel like a piece of shit in return for wanting to break-up. "
"AITA for honking at some doing 30 in a 65 on the highway? | My friend and I are driving behind a guy merging onto the highway.  The other guy has his hazards on and is doing 30 miles per hour.  The speed limit on the highway 65.  We both merge onto the highway and he continues to go 30 miles per hour.  I'm stuck behind him for a few minutes, until it is safe for me to pass him.  As I pass him, I honk to let him know that what he is doing is dangerous.  My friend argues that I shouldn't have honked at him because with his hazards on, clearly he knows there's an issue with his car.  I argue that if he knows there is an issue with his car, he should not have entered the highway and instead should have used the back roads.  Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for taking the parking spot a lady was standing in? | I (38F) was driving around with my husband (37M), looking for parallel parking in a busy area of town. I saw a parking spot that a lady (45ishF) was standing in. She's a human, not a car, so I start backing into the spot. She kind of waves at me like I didn't see her, but she moves out of the way.

As I open my door to get out, she comes to my door yelling at me that I'm rude. Because she's already yelling, I yell back that she's the rude one because she was standing in a spot meant for cars in a busy area.

Then, the person she was saving the spot for came around in their car and was blocking traffic (there were two lanes, one going in each direction) because she was yelling at me instead of getting in the car. She told me that I almost hit her with my car. I feel like (and I didn't say this out loud) I didn't hit her because she moved out of the way. If she didn't move I wouldn't have backed in.

I start walking to my destination and she is still standing in the lane beside her car yelling at me. Before she gets in the car, she calls me a gorilla. The only thing I have called her during the yelling is rude. And also that she's not a car so she can't park in a spot.

My husband and I go on our way, then after getting what we were in the area for we head back to our car. I pass the lady again on the sidewalk with her companion (maybe her dad?). I want to ignore her but she sees me and says, ""Oh, god."" Then stands there yelling at me again that I'm rude and she's going to call the police because I almost hit her. The person she's with called me a bitch. I was very careful not to swear because I'm not sure if that counts as verbal assault or what. He yells at me sarcastically, ""Your parents must be so proud of you!"" And I was like, ""Actually, my mom is!"" He also said something to along the lines of, ""She's proud of you for swearing and calling people names?"" I say, ""I never swore! And this woman called me a gorilla!"" 

The man accuses my husband of calling him an asshole. Which I didn't hear but my husband admits it, and my husband also told them to ""get the fuck out of here"" because the man had called me a name, which I also didn't hear amid all the yelling. The old man (and I admit I laughed at this a little inside) said, ""I never called her a gorilla, I called her a bitch!"" I said again that it was the woman called me a gorilla.

The woman threatens to call the police and I said, ""Please do!"" Because I feel like how can you argue that a person is a car? And parking spots are for cars? Also, I didn't hit her?

AITA for not driving on and just giving her the parking spot? Is that by default an A-hole move? Because she was so angry it makes me question it. Is there an unspoken code for drivers that if someone is standing in a parking spot, just move on? I argued back because she yelled first. I've been conflicted about this since it happened. When I saw he was older, I felt kinda bad. I just want to add that I feel like if she had said to me civilly, instead of coming at me yelling, ""My dad is an older dude, is it okay if we take this spot"" I would have moved. 

I did look up afterwards to see if it's legal in my town for people to hold parking spots. And in a nutshell, it's not, but also don't hit people with cars. Which I didn't.

Edit: Thanks, everyone. Looks like I am NTA for taking/keeping the spot, ESH for yelling.

Edit2: And I am A-hole for backing into the spot: she's a human and I'm in a car and even though I wasn't going to hit her it is still a threatening thing to do, which is bad. This is my first AITA so I'm not sure if I can split up my judgment like that."
"AITA for repurposing the wedding fund and refusing to compromise? | I have 2 kids, different dads. I have a savings account for both. The account of my oldest, Lucy, has had £10 per week added to it by both myself and her father, and has gone up by about a grand a year and is over £13,000. The second account is for my son, Luke, who is 6. I have regularly added to this account since I found out I was pregnant, and have about 3.5k in the account.

His father, my fiance, had a separate account for Luke and has told me he was doing the £10 a week since we started the accounts. I recently found out the account he has for Luke only has a couple hundred in it. My fiance earns less than me but more than my Ex. If my Ex can afford £10 a week routinely, when he has nearly identical spending habits to me and my fiance but lives alone and therefore pays for rent/bills in full, and my fiance earns more than my Ex, there is no reason my fiance should not have been able to make the £10 payments each week (I earn the most of all 3 of us, followed by my fiance, followed by Ex). My fiance said he ""forgot"" and asked me to redistribute the contents of Lucy's fund to make up for the money missing from Luke's. I said fuck no.

Luke's account is around 3k less than it should be. We have a wedding fund that contains a little over 2k of mine and my fiance's combined money. We don't want a huge wedding but we do want a really nice honeymoon where we can just go away for a week and not worry about money while we're there or returning.

My fiance says that he doesn't have the money to replace the 3k Luke is missing all at once. I have said that I want to take the wedding fund as it currently stands and deposit the lot into the savings account I control that is meant for Luke. I would not be doing this if my fiance had not 1) lied for around 7 years about saving for our son, 2) claimed he did not have the money to replace it, 3) suggested I take money from my daughter, saved up with help from my Ex, to fix my fiance's mistake. I also said that I want him to set up a direct deposit of £10 to the account that only I control each week. I will not budge on any of this as we agreed years ago now that this was a good idea and that it was important to invest in our son's future, and he has lied to me for 7 years now about making that investment.

AITA?

&#x200B;

For people asking why this is so urgent to me: It's not the end of the world if the full amount isn't in Luke's account any time soon, as the plan was always to give each kid the total in the account when they were 18/moving out, but my fiance says he can't afford to repay the money in bulk or multiple installments and if he keeps on not paying, then when Lucy is 18 she'll have 19-20 grand, and when Luke is 18 he'll get closer to 10k from just me. While I don't doubt he'd be grateful for whatever he gets, he'd get half of what Lucy will if my fiance doesn't make up the difference.

&#x200B;

Update:

I asked him again why he didn't have the money. He said he just didn't. I asked him to bring up his bank statement, or payslip, or anything that shows how much money he has (bearing in mind he was last paid on the 28th and today is the 30th). He refused. I told him that if we were combining finances in any way I should be able to see where his money is going. He responded that I wasn't showing him my financial information, so I pulled up my banking app so he could see my own balance and transaction history. He then showed me his last statement, which his bank emailed him today. We had a fight and he's staying in a hotel tonight, which it turns out he can more than afford. He has nearly 60k in his personal current account and savings accounts, presumably meant solely for himself.

I cannot see us getting married after this. Not ever. It's not just the trust issue, but also that he, knowing he had nearly 60k in savings, decided that it was okay to try and guilt trip me into taking money meant for my daughter to fix it for him."
"AITA for egging on my gf to follow a potentially impossible career path? | I'll try and keep this reasonably short. My gf has a very long standing dream of flying planes for a living. However, she has a defect in one of her eyes (something to do with the tendons in the back) that causes her to have 20-100 vision. For the longest time she's been told she can't ever be a pilot due to this issue. I'm of the opinion that she shouldn't give up on it if it really means that much to her. I don't know anything about the process, requirements, or anything really but the way I see it there has to be a doctor somewhere who can help her or there has to be some way she can fly around (maybe with an experienced co-pilot?) and do what she wants to do in spite of her eye issue. But a part of me feels like I'm going to be the biggest asshole if I continue encouraging her to do this and it ends up just being that I gave her false hope and wasted her time and emotional energy. Should I continue, or AITA?"
"AITA for making my soon to be ex wife pay for the entirety of our divorce? | Long story short, my wife of 5 years cheated on me with an high school ex of hers last summer. We have a daughter together who is almost 3 years old. We decided to divorce as soon as I found out. She is now dating the person she cheated on me with. I now primarily take care of our daughter and moved closer to my parents, which is only a couple of hours away from where we used to live. I told her that I would not pay for any part of the divorce as this was her fault. She argued that I’m being bitter and spiteful. I told her I would cooperate; not make things messy; and would even split custody, I just won’t pay a cent for this divorce. I even offered to do the paperwork as well. She replied a long paragraph calling me names and saying how I ruined the marriage a “long time ago”. I’m not budging. Parents are on board with this, however, my sister thinks I am an asshole and should contribute to the costs of the divorce. AITA?"
"WIBTA if we get married without telling our family and friends (even after)? | So I have been with my partner for 12 years.

We've always been happily unmarried (even happily non-cohabiting) and we do not agree with a lot of things surrounding traditional marriage.

However, we did look into it, and in terms of benefits and inheritance, it does turn out better than any cohabitation contract we could draft. 

This is doubly interesting, because both of us have family members we'd really rather not see inheriting from us.

I have pre-inherited property, which is another reason I did not wish to marry, but frankly I think this could be solved with a pre-nup or good marriage contract.

Anyway, we're thinking of maybe having a secret marriage. Not just wedding, but marriage.

Meaning we'd have a courthouse wedding with only those legally required to be there, no wedding party (as, at all, not even for close family) and not even tell people we're married. Like, at all. We'd still refer to each other as boyfriend/girlfriend or partner, not husband/wife (as we find that off-putting, and I also want to avoid clueless people calling me by his last name).

We'd only be using the spousal status for legal matters.

Would we be assholes if we did this? Basically going maximum cheapo, no wedding or engagement rings, depriving the whole family of a celebration, and after that basically low-key lying to everyone about our relationship status?

edit: as to why we think we'd be assholes? Our parents and other relatives have been HOPING for 12 years we'd marry and that there would be a wedding and I'm sure they'd feel pretty betrayed."
"AITA for not wanting to move my wedding date for my son | My son is in his last year of high school and Sept 2020 will be starting Uni.  My wedding date is set for May 2020 (not to my son dad's , we separated when my son was 9)

My son wants me to postpone my wedding date so when he applies for Uni funding so I'll still be a single parent. 

I have the venue, caterer, bartender booked for the wedding.  

I feel my son is being a bit entitled, I'll the do the best I can to help him with fees,and I do have an RESP set up so he has about 70 - 80 % of the money he will need for first year already.

He doesn't see the big deal in me moving up my wedding date to accommodate him.  I don't really think it's my sole responsibility to fund his university, he should foot some of the cost as well.

Just a note : his birth father comes and goes in his life, but by has provided no support to him or me financial or otherwise since we've been apart.

Edit. This is my first time on Reddit so I did respond but not sure if people can see it. 

I really appreciate all the feedback. Seems like I'm 50% the asshole 

I do have 15,000k in an education fund for him and I did tell him I would pay the rest for year 1.  

I stick by my entitled comment. I would never expect my parents to alter their life for me. I feel like he expects this. 

These comments have given me things to think about which is what I was looking for. 

Thanks all !"
"AITA for yelling at tourist to delete our picture | Me(16M) and my friends were sitting in park last afternoon. Just hanging out and drinking, It was already getting dark and there weren’t many people there. 

I notice this guy, he’s clearly a tourist,  he stayed there for a bit. Then pulled out his big ass camera with flash and took picture of us. None of us wanted it. I’m the one who can speak the best English and I don’t have that much accent so he would understand me better. I went up to him, Said Hi and asked if he took picture of us, he said yes and told me he was a photographer. I asked him to delete it nicely, he refused and told me he was just gonna keep it for himself. I told him I didn’t care. We argued for few minutes. I yelled and told him to delete it and grabbed his camera. He just said okay okay and deleted it while I was watching. After I went back to my friends they said that I went overboard and I should’ve just let it go."
"AITA for saying some pretty raunchy stuff in a group text. | So one of my friends gets a new phone number. He makes a group chat to tell everyone so they have his new number. I look at the text and it lists a lot of our friends in it. We all mess with each other a lot and they all know how much I hate group texts. I think everyone hates them really. So I send back “F**k everyone in this group chat. Lol” assuming it was all my buddies. Well this guy includes his parents, grandparents, and even his preacher (of course) in it. All I saw were the names of my buddies. Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for asking to look at texts between my GF and her Ex? | Recently my GF has been what I perceive as sketchy with some stuff with her ex. 

First day, she saw him when we had been arguing and she hadn’t made plans to see him to drop off meds for their dog and to see the dog until we were far into our argument. She went to eat with him that day and drop the meds off but did not see the dog.

Second day, she mentioned during an argument that she might go see the dog that day. Later, she said she wanted to go eat but I had to sleep for work. Before she left, I asked if she was going to eat by herself and she said she was. Later she told me she ate with him even though she said she was going to eat by herself and saw their dog after eating. Also, that the ex picked her up for it all.

Third day, we had an argument and during it made plans to go see her dog during the argument again. This is late at night about 9. Her ex comes and picks her up. Later, she did not go to see her dog. The two of them went to eat instead then she came back after I called due to seeing that she did not go to his place after he picked her up.

Fourth day, I bring up wanting to see her phone and see what’s gone on between the two of them. When this happens, as she’s going through the messages, she turns her phone away and tells me there’s stuff she doesn’t want me to see. After that, she tells me it’s emotional stuff she chose to talk to him about and not talk to me about.

At this point, I am worried about what is there. She has told me what is there but due to what I see as sketchy and her turning her phone away, I’ve asked to see it myself.

Am I the asshole for asking to see her phone at this point or any point there?"
"WIBTA for telling my family about the DNA test results? | A couple months back was my birthday, and my mother decided it would be fun to gift me a DNA test. I was very excited since I’ve always wanted to find out more about my heritage. Thing is, as far as my family was concerned, it was an open and shut case since we already had a pretty good knowledge of my father’s side of the family, and my mother was 100% sure she was ethnically... let’s say Eastern European. Anyway, I took the test and all was well.

Until today, when I received the results. My Eastern European heritage was significantly different from what we had anticipated, with almost 20% corresponding with an ethnical minority in my mother’s home country. 

This got me thinking, could my mother’s family possibly have miscalculated the percentage of “pure-bloodedness”? 20% is far too much to just be a miscalculation, right? Then I remembered that my mother’s father was hospitalized for several years following a stroke, and my mother was born shortly (too shortly) after his release, thirteen years after her sister. My mother also looks nothing like her father, and has very dark features. 

All this has led me to believe that my only living relative, my very elderly maternal grandfather, may in fact not be my mother’s father. 

Instinctively I don’t want to ruin my grandfather’s life, but doesn’t he deserve to know? My mom will have an identity crisis for sure.... What the hell do I do???
WIBTA for telling them the truth??

TL;DR: Mother’s biological father probably isn’t her father. "
"AITA for the drinking game I created? |  

Back in college I roomed with 3 guys. One was never there, one I got along with really well, and the third was a bit different from the rest of us.

I imagine the third guy was somewhere on the spectrum but we never asked or treated him different because of it, and the year went pretty smooth all in all.

The roommate who I got along with and I would drink a lot through the year, mostly sitting around the apartment playing video games or watching sports. We'd come up with random little drinking games whenever one of us had a good idea.

The roommate who didn't talk with much had a habit of coming downstairs into the living room and just standing there. He wouldn't say anything, just stand there and watch us, watch the TV, not much else. There wasn't much furniture and we did invite him to sit the first few times, but he just shrugged it off.

One day when he came down to his spot, I had a an idea for a drinking game, whenever he comes downstairs, secretly start a timer and for every 30 seconds he's there without moving or saying anything, take a drink.

I will admit, not the best idea I've ever had, but we never told him we were doing this, we just kept an eye on timer and took a drink every uninterrupted 30 seconds.

I mentioned this to my wife the other day and said I was kinda an A-Hole for doing this.

Again, not saying it was the best idea I ever had, but it was a victim less game. AITA?"
"WIBTA if I confronted someone with an open hatred towards men | There’s this girl I went to high school with (aquaintances, only spoken like once irl) and she keeps posting to Facebook and Instagram saying awful things about men. No one in particular, just men in general. I’m also a female but I find the things she posts so awful and idk how she gets people agreeing with her. I tried messaging her on Instagram saying that it was offensive and she had no sympathy and blocked me. She still has me on Facebook but I’ve held my tongue. I feel I need to call her out publicly because I tried privately messaging her and look what happened. I feel like some men that like those posts might be somewhat afraid of her and might like it purely to try and get on her good side. Idek what I hope to achieve like she can have an opinion but it’s honestly disgusting. WIBTA if I called her out publicly?

Edit: also when I messaged her on insta she screenshot my messages, blurred my name and uploaded them to her story"
"AITA for ruining thanksgiving by blowing up on my sister? | So thanksgiving was 2 days ago, and after dinner I laid into my sister.  We never got along but she has ALWAYS looked down upon me and always has to make snide remarks about my lifestyle.  I don't get it, I have never tried to purposefully hurt her since we hit our adult ages and I always tried to be kind and thoughtful but she never wanted any of that.  During family gatherings she always has to bring up how I'm a stoner loser who would rather party than be here.  I usually keep my mouth shut cause I don't want to fight with her, all I wanted was for us to respect and love each other but I guess she has different ideas of our relationship.

This thanksgiving she started again after we ate and I just had enough.  I said something along the lines of ""you know.......ive always tried to be kind and thoughtful of you and always wanted us to be close and love each other.......but now, I just don't fucking care.  Since we both moved out you have been NOTHING but a straight up asshole to me and always look down upon me.  I am fucking done with it, I will see you on the holidays to please mom and dad but thats it. Stay. out. of. my. life.""  After I said that I left, it felt incredible to finally stand up to her and her constant snide remarks and looking down of me.  I got a call from her calling me a dick and how I ruined thanksgiving.  I answered cause I thought she was gonna apologize but when I realized it wasn't I just flat out hung up and she, and my mom have been calling me non-stop and I just flat out refuse to answer either of them.  Ill call my mom back when I'm ready but I'm pretty much done with my sister.

"WIBTA for going on a cruise with my kids and leaving our other two kids behind? | My partner and I have a blended family. I am a widow and have two kids from that previous relationship. My partner has a crazy ex-wife who he had two kids with. Our kids are roughly the same ages (5-11). His ex-wife has mental health issues that she is not addressing. We have been battling her in court for years, she has specifically told me in the past that she will do everything she can to ruin our lives. In fact, we have a trip coming up next weekend for a sports tournament, and she wouldn't sign the papers to renew her kids passport. So my partner is staying home with his 2 kids while I go with my kids on the tournament trip.

We all live together, and my partners kids do one week on, one week off with his ex. His ex never does anything for her kids. We pay for all of their needs, she won't bring them to sports on her week, they don't do any activities, etc. Because of this, we try to plan the majority of our fun family outings on the weekends that we have his kids. 

I've been wanting to take my kids on a real vacation for years. It's something I haven't been able to do in a while, and have finally worked things out to be able to. We looked at march break to go on a cruise as a family, but unfortunately my partners kids are at their mothers house that week. I feel terrible for wanting to go on the cruise regardless, because I know it will be difficult for my partners kids. But I also don't want my kids to suffer just because their step-siblings mother is unreasonable. 

WIBTA is myself, my partner and my two kids went on this cruise while our other 2 kids were at their mothers place?  We would of course talk to my kids about being sensitive about"
"AITA for being offended when my boyfriend of 3 years asked me when my birthday was? | Super simple context:

We're both 24 and live together. We have been dating for 3 years, or 3 of my birthdays. He just asked me the date and year of my birthday. 

I clearly was a little taken aback by the question, and suggested he could have looked it up on Facebook or another resource instead of asking me outright and hurting my feelings.

Then he got very defensive and claimed I was disability shaming him because he has ADHD and a hard time remembering dates.

I ended up just giving it to him, but I still maintain that it's an offensive question to ask at this point. AITA?"
"AITA for laughing when my boyfriend told me about his embarrassing poo problem? | I (20f) have recently come under fire from my boyfriend and his brothers because of an issue to do with poo. Literally. 

My boyfriend stays at my house a few nights a week, and usually I work throughout the week and sometimes weekends (I do princess parties so my schedule is all over the place), so he is often at our place alone during the day. He often made excuses to go home for an hour or so during the day if I was there. I always thought it was weird, because he'd make excuses like he had to get his phone charger even though we have the same cable. I never thought too much into it though, just thought he liked using his own stuff. 

However, due to \*recent circumstances\* I've been at home pretty much all the time. His car also broke down a couple of weeks ago and he is waiting to get paid to get it fixed, so I've been driving him if he needs to go somewhere. He's asked me three times in the last week to drive him to his old place (our living situation atm is that he lives full time with me, but he still has a few months left on a lease with his old roommate and they have a few shared things there that my bf loves, such as the ps4 and a nice blender, so he occasionally stays the night there if he hangs out with his roommate). 

I told him last time that he should probably just bring everything he's going to need over to mine because I'm sick of driving back and forth for things like a charger or a DVD, especially when it takes him like 20 minutes to retrieve these things. He said he wouldn't ask again, but he did today. I asked him if something else was up, and he finally came clean. 

Our toilet won't flush his poo. His poo is too large to flush. I'll admit the toilet it pretty weak and sometimes you have to double flush, but his apparently won't go anywhere no matter how many flushes and he had to take inspiration from poo knife the only few times he's done it. That's why he goes back to his old place so much. 

I, naturally, thought this was hilarious and laughed basically until I cried. I thought he would be laughing too, but he just looked quite upset. He told he it wasn't fucking funny and sulked for hours. I got a facebook message from his brother later saying he'd always been insecure about his pooping. I think this whole situation is funny and no big deal, but he's very hurt and his brother is pissed too. AITA?"
"AITA for demanding to go through my partner’s phone? | For context: we’ve been dating for 1.5 years. Also for context, we’re both pretty private with our phones, her more than me. Her notifications don’t go to the lock screen, and she has a complicated password I’d never guess (not that I’d normally care; I barely even noticed until now). 

This happened last night and I can’t shake through whether or not I’m justified. We were cuddling and a name called “Ken 😜” popped up on her phone on FaceTime. She tried to reject it really quickly but it seemed suspicious to me. I asked her who was that and she hesitated a moment before admitting it was her ex. This bothered me because we both don’t really say positive things about our exes, and I have no idea why he’d FaceTime (I don’t know if it’s just me, but video calling seems a lot more personal than phone calls or text messages). 

I asked her if she normally talks to her ex and she says no; they never talk, and doesn’t know why he called. I asked why was his name saved as that if she never talks to him, and she got annoyed and maintained that it was from when they were dating and she never deleted it. 

I asked her if she’d mind if I saw her text messages; not for everyone, just for that specific person. Or if I could look at her call logs. She looked at my like I had four eyes and was **PISSED**. She said that why do I want to go snooping on her phone? It’s a breach of privacy. I replied that I didn’t see it as snooping; it was just suspicious that a name she supposedly never talked to FaceTimed her, and it wouldn’t really take much to confirm her story. She restated that if I kept up acting crazy, I’d lose her, and I’m acting ridiculous. We fought, and as of now, we’re not speaking. 

I never really had a reason to not trust her, which is why I think I might be acting crazy. At the same time, it would’ve taken a quick 5 second glance to confirm her story. As it stands, it just sounds sketchy, and I can’t tell if she’s just that private, or is hiding something. I would normally NEVER go through my partner’s phone without probably cause, but an ex FaceTiming you and the sketchiness just seemed weird. 

AITA for wanting to go through her phone?

Edit: To add a little bit, we’ve established early in the relationship that we’re not really on speaking terms with our ex. So that’s why I was suspicious. Because, we don’t talk to our exes, I would think there wouldn’t be much of a text conversation to read. I didn’t want to snoop through her whole phone; just wanted to see if they were communicating regularly.

I see a bit of bickering in the comments soo to be clear, I **did** demand her. I told her she was ~~being~~ taking me for a naive idiot and that what she said was the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. I told her that she needed to give me her phone now, and I opened up my hand expectantly. Hence the title."
"AITA for refusing to pay my friend $35 after learning he had previously scammed me out of $160? | A couple months ago I decided to play a 1v1 bet against my friend in a fighting game called Brawlhalla. He was the one who offered the bet to me, which was surprising because he is known to be pretty bad at the game. I quickly accepted his offer and we began fighting. After a couple lost games I realized I was getting destroyed and a little tilted, so i did a big bet in an attempt to get my money back. I lost that one too, and at this point I owed about $160.  I decided that I wasn’t going to be able to beat him so I stopped betting against him and agreed to pay him the money that I owed him as soon as I had the money. A couple weeks later I wanted to get Black Ops 4 because my friends were all playing it and the same friend I bet against agreed to buy the game for me. The game cost about $35, putting me at about $195 in debt.  Fast forward to today, about a month later. My other friend who is known to be very good at brawlhalla told me that during the entirety of my bets, he was playing for the worse friend. He told me this because he didn’t realistically expect me to pay $195 so instead he should just settle for the $35 I ACTUALLY owed instead of the money that they tried to scam me from.  So I was a little bit pissed upon hearing that my friend tried scamming me out of $160 and I decided to test him. I pretended like I had the full $195 and was ready to pay him, and he said “okay yea ill take it”. At this point I realized he was fully willing to completely scam me out of $195 and I now feel like the $35 that I owe him aside from the scam bets should not be paid. Am I the asshole? "
"AITA because after my dog shit all over a hotel room, I left all the dirty stuff in the tub? | I want to know in case I'm ever in this situation again.

My dog and I took an 8 hour drive to another state for him to have surgery, the reason is that clinic specializes in this surgery and makes it affordable when it's usually very unaffordable.

We left at 2am from our state, got to the clinic by 10am, he went into surgery at noon, I picked him up at 7 that evening and we spent the night in a hotel before driving back in the morning. The plan was to leave as early in the morning as possible so my dog could get home and recover.

I woke up at around 5 am due to a horrible stench and my dog freaking out. He had some kind of reaction to the sedation and medications and shat ALL OVER the hotel room.

I just want to note that this is a hotel chain well-known for allowing pets so he was allowed to be in the hotel.

Anyway I leaped up and brought him outside as he was still in the middle of having this diarrhea everywhere. We spent about 30 minutes outside, it seemed like it all came out. Then I went back in the hotel room started trying to clean, but it was clear I did not have the needed supplies.

I went to WalMart to get cleaning supplies, got back about 20 minutes later and the situation in the hotel room was TWICE as bad as what it was when I left.

I then spent the next 3 hours on my hands and knees scrubbing hotel room carpet and all surfaces. All soft and washable things that got dirty (towels, sheets, blankets) I piled them in the tub. 

By the time I was done in the hotel room you could not tell it had been an epic shit disaster unless you were really looking for stains and knew which ones had already been on the carpet when we got there. It was very sanitary and clean.

I threw out all my own trash such as used paper towels and rags etc.

However I did leave all the dirty hotel stuff in a jumble in the tub. 

My dog was still sick and I felt I had to get on the road. I was also really afraid he would have explosive diarrhea in my car during the 8 hour drive back so I wanted to get going.

I left a note explaining the situation and a tip for the hotel staff.

The hotel did not comment to me and I did not get any extra charges.

I want to know AITA since in case I ever am in this situation again I could handle it differently."
"WIBTA for reporting my friend and coworker to HR | I have a coworker who has become my friend over the past couple years but over the past eightish months, some of her behaviour at work is driving me completely insane. 

Our work has a lunch/break policy where you can either have a 15 min break and a 1 hour lunch or a 1 H 15 M lunch. Most people choose the longer lunch but my friend and I are both smokers (gross, I know) so we go for a smoke break in the mornings and used to take shortened lunches together. 

This past summer she got a puppy and started going home at lunch to let the dog out and take it for a walk so we no longer have lunch together. In order to beat lunch time traffic, she started leaving for lunch half an hour earlier. She leaves at 11:30 instead of noon and claims to come back at 12:45. Which largely is not true as I walk by her desk around that time to get to mine from the lunch room. She is rarely at it, neither is her coat, meaning she is still out of the office. Also, that means she is taking the 1 H 15 M lunch although she continues to come for a smoke with me in the morning. 

She also started taking a second smoke break in the afternoon with less than an hour left in her shift. So all in all, she is taking 2 hours worth of breaks/lunches everyday. 

On top of that, she has been coming in an hour late every Friday for a month. She tells the firm she is going to physiology for her knee (she fell on the ice walking her dog) but told me she’s just been sleeping in and isn’t going to physio. 

At our last staff meeting (three weeks ago) or HR manager said there are some complaints of certain individuals abusing the lunch/break policy and that if we choose the 15 M break, 1 H lunch option daily, to let her know. I sent HR an email stating I choose this option. 

My friend on the other hand did not claiming she doesn’t think she needs to because she “stays late all the time.” This is also not true as she leaves before I do and comes to say goodbye. If she does stay late on a particular day it is very very rarely more than 15 M.  In total, she is taking 4 H 45 M a week of break time she shouldn’t be and I know for a fact she is not making that time up in anyway.

She complains to me and to HR about how busy she is and needs task taken away from her role. She pointed out to me today that another assistant is lazy because she takes a walk around the office twice a day. I’ve talked to her about coordinating her breaks with HR and about how taking them isn’t helping her workload. She snaps at me and says if she doesn’t do these things none of her work will get done because she’ll be so stressed. 

I’m having such a hard time letting this go. WIBTA for reporting her to HR?

Edit: Thank you for all the responses and comments. To be clear, I’m not tracking her time but our work stations are right next to each other and she goes past me with her coat on so it’s impossible not to notice. I decided not to go to HR because I don’t want to come off as petty but was a little more confrontational when she came to my desk to tell me about the number of unread emails she has this morning. I responded with “I don’t really have time to talk about this everyday and quite frankly, I don’t have any sympathy for you because you spend a lot of time away from your desk that would really help your situation if it was spent on those emails.” She got in a big huff about that and we are no longer friends. She has shown herself to be dishonest and lazy so that’s fine. "
"AITA for holding a grudge against my coworker for “snitching” on me? | If you see my post history you’ll know what happened but I’ll still retell the event of course. TLDR at the bottom.

My coworker Aubrey is around the same age as me. We both work at a grocery store in a popular local shopping center. We’re both sometimes on our phones at work, especially after closing, which is when she’s always scheduled. We also both sometimes complain about work (who doesn’t?). Our job isn’t “the best”, per say. Everyone kind of agrees that the management could be much better and that things aren’t handled how they should be sometimes. People at this workplace gossip a lot too, word gets around. But enough about that, I’ll get to the story.

I was working in the afternoon and Aubrey wasn’t there yet. I was asked to do returns (putting back items that customers didn’t wants) one time and I agreed to it. I liked being able to break from the normalcy of just being on a cash register, so I asked to do them a few more times, and my supervisors OKed it, specifically a supervisor named Allee. My final return that day was one single rotisserie chicken being returned to the meat department on the other side of the store. I decided to take a snapchat that said something like “i’m making excuses to get away from the register lol”. It didn’t show that I was returning a chicken but that’s what I was doing. I know I know I’m stupid or whatever, but I’ve made posts like this before and it never triggered Aubrey before. Can you tell where I’m going with this? Aubrey screenshotted the snapchat post so I got paranoid. I posted “guys I’m just doing returns, I’m not just screwing around”. So she KNOWS that I’m not just being an idiot. But alas, 15 minutes later I’m called into the manager’s (Teresa’s) office and she shows me the screenshotted picture and goes off on me telling me that I was a horrible employee when I started and that she should have never been so nice to me and let me work here. Teresa is known for being a bit “harsh” or critical, she’s sort of a Karen but I feel bad saying that because she thinks that my post was like a personal attack on her or something. I calmly explained that I would never intentionally be disrespectful to her and that I was in fact doing my job by doing returns and that Aubrey (didn’t mention her by name) was taking my post somewhat out of context.

I have to work again in about half an hour and i was told I would be getting a write up from Nick, a higher up manager. I told Aubrey that I don’t want to be mad at her and that I want to be her friend but she just kept saying “then do your job”. So, Reddit, AITA?

TLDR: I got to do some work away from the cash register and posted on my story “im making excuses to get away from the register lol”. Coworker screenshots it, I make another post clarifying that I am in fact doing work, coworker sends only the first post to a manager saying I’m not doing my job even though I am, manager berates me, I am pissed off at coworker. AITA?

Edit - we’re allowed to be on our phones occasionally if we’re not immediately busy and the customers don’t see, me and many other coworkers do the same thing. I’m getting written up for the CONTENT of the post, not for posting."
"WIBTA for cutting off sick daughter? | This is my first post here so I hope I’m doing it right.

My daughter (25F) has been struggling with anorexia, anxiety, and depression for several years now. She’s been through multiple therapists, hospital stays, and treatment facilities. She has a cycle where she’ll go to treatment, do well for a few months afterward, and then relapse, ending up back in treatment. 

Her illnesses have left her behind her peers when it comes to hitting milestones: she hasn’t graduated college yet since she keeps needing to take semesters off for treatment, and when she’s able, she works a part-time minimum wage retail job. She’s still depends on us financially for the most part because she obviously does not earn much at her current job. She’s still on our insurance, but it doesn’t cover much, if anything, when it comes to the care she needs, so my husband and I end up footing the bill for her appointments, treatment stays, etc.

It’s been years of dealing with this, and at this point, my entire family is exhausted. My daughter has expressed guilt for costing us so much money, and every time she swears that this will be her last time going away for help, but a couple months pass and we end up right back where we started. She promises that she’s trying, but I’m starting to doubt that. If she were, obviously something would have clicked or changed by now.

My other children have had to have their lives be put on the back burner because my eldest daughter has taken priority with her issues, and I don’t feel like it’s fair to them. At this point, I wonder if it’s time to step back and just let my daughter figure this out for herself.

WIBTA if I stopped financially supporting my daughter until she proves that she can stay in solid recovery for a significant amount of time? I don’t want my daughter to die, but at this point, I feel like there’s nothing I can do to help her anymore. I’m at the end of my rope.

EDIT: She has a treatment team consisting of a therapist, dietitian, psychiatrist, and primary care physician that she sees weekly/bi-weekly. That just doesn’t seem to be enough for her for long periods of time.

EDIT 2: We’ve looked into getting her on Medicaid, yet none of her providers and practically zero treatment facilities take it, so even if she had it, it wouldn’t be of any use. I did not consider having her apply for disability. I’ll bring that up to her."
"WIBTA For banning difficult regulars for not tipping | I know it sounds bad. Throwaway because main is too easy to identify. I manage a restaurant serving a specific kind of Asian cuisine in a very multi cultural city. I understand tipping varies by culture, but generally a 10-20% tip is standard in the US. Ask any server, if you can’t afford the tip, you can’t afford the meal. We have a family that happens to be from the same country whose food we serve, and they’ve been coming in for some time now. Usually 4-6 people. They ALWAYS have special requests, whether it’s something from the dinner menu at lunchtime, substitutions, something made a certain specific way. We ALWAYS do our best, but they always nitpick, always mumble something about “traditionally”, and need to be checked on CONSTANTLY. My servers have begun to complain, since they rack up a $100-300 and tip a big fat zero. Me and the other managers have had heated discussions about possibly banning them, and I’m on the fence about it. Would we be the assholes for banning a notoriously difficult group that never tips?

EDIT: as per our city laws, we pay our employees above minimum wage and the tips don’t factor into their wage. Tips are on top of regular pay.

EDIT 2: the owners trust us and are aware of the situation. This is an issue of staff morale, not about whether or not our employees make a livable wage. 

EDIT 3: hopefully this will clarify our issue. Our employees are paid a livable wage independent of their tips. The big issue here is that on a bill so high, the server loses money due to kitchen/support tip out, and because I can’t blame my servers for not wanting to serve a difficult table that doesn’t tip, when there’s plenty of other tables that do.

EDIT 4: while I do accept my judgement as being TA, I’d like to remind everyone that I’m a manager. I don’t get gratuity, I don’t care about the tips. This is about choosing either the happiness of my servers, or the business of an extremely difficult group of customers who my servers are always reluctant to serve. I’m not in control of my countries tipping standards. We do our best by paying a fair wage. Just lookin for some advice as a manager.

FINAL EDIT: needless to say, bigger response than I expected. I can understand where both sides are coming from, and while I do still feel somewhat like TA, I can’t justify my servers feeling disrespected for the sake of one table. Our restaurant is pretty busy, and one $300 tab won’t break us, as the owners told us when they handed over the decision to us managers. Our restaurant is also more on the upscale side, and our servers are very well trained as we are extremely selective in our hiring process. I spoke to one of the servers, and hearing more about the table I’ve decided that my stance (not the final decision as I still need to talk it over with the other 2 managers) is that I will allow servers to choose not to take them, try to get them some compensation if someone chooses to serve them, and if truly no one wants to, i think as a manager I’d be okay taking them myself, as I won’t be getting a tip anyway and it’d help me get a first hand look at what they’re really like. I don’t want to ban them, mostly because it’s not a conversation I’d like to have with a customer, I agree that it’s a severe move to ban a family that genuinely seems to enjoy the food (they’re in at least once per week), but they also will no longer get special treatment, which is the one thing I’ll be putting my foot down on. Lastly I’m going to try to suggest a tip sharing system where everyone gets their tips according to hours worked and not based off of what tables you get, as it’s probably more fair that way anyway. Unfortunately that’s the best I can do in the tipping culture that the US has, I don’t necessarily agree with it but at the end of it all I don’t have much control. We do what we can, but we can’t change the world. Yes it is your choice not to tip, but if you do that and disrespect my employees on top of it, I absolutely am gonna step in as I believe they are entitled to respect from their customers. Good employees are more valuable than disrespectful customers IMO. I’m not sure this post is big enough to warrant an update, but I can give one if you guys wanna know how my discussion with my comanagers goes, and how the customers’ next visit goes. Thank you guys for all the input."
"AITA if I take away a present for my son after he bullied his depressed sister? | My daughter has struggled with depression for the better part of the year, I have tried my damnedest to help her out.  Therapists, medication, being there for her, giving her the support she needs.  Thank god she's better now and leaves her bed without us forcing her to.  I am very very happy for her and she's even going out to hang out with her friends, she's doing better but its still a sorta shake-y bridge and ill take that after all the work she's done to get to this point

My son has NO filter whatsoever, I have tried to get him to stop but he says whats on his mind and whenever he wants to.  My kids were hanging out in the living room watching tv or something when I heard my son say ""At least I wasn't a depressed loser who couldn't even get out of bed, now give me the fucking remote"".  My daughter ran away crying and I went berserk on my son saying how he can't do that and how what he said was terrible and how he hurt his sister's feelings.  He gave me a half hearted ""sorry"" and his sister one too, it was total BS and he didn't mean it.  This happened about a week ago and he's grounded for the entire christmas break and I'm thinking about not giving him his big christmas present  it was tickets to a football game for him and his friend cause they are big football fans but now I don't think he's earned or deserves them after what he said to his sister

I haven't done anything yet but AITA if I do take away the football present?

EDIT:my kids are 16yo girl and 15yo boy 

EDIT 2:Some of y'all are assuming that I favor my daughter cause I spent more time with her WHEN SHE WAS DEPRESSED and not with my son.  Since she isn't battling that anymore I've spent WAY more time with my son and taking him places to make it up to him for giving me space while I help with his sister"
"AITA - Wife not invited to sister's wedding... | Hi all, 

&#x200B;

My little sister (now early 20's) and my wife (been together 12 years, married 2) used to get on just fine, but in her teens my sister was diagnosed with BPD and sadly a lot of people have been written off by her because of it - my wife included. 

It's a little more complicated, obviously, as my wife and I fell out with my sister around the time of our own wedding which ended up with my sister not attending (despite trying to persuade her to). As a result, one of the defining memories of my big day is my mum crying in the background of photos because my sister isn't there. 

Since then I've managed to patch things up with my sister to a certain degree, but she and my wife will only communicate to say hello and keep things civil. 

Fast forward to this year and my sister is getting married. She asked to meet with me in the local coffee shop and when we were there she proceeded (nervously, not 'shittily') to tell me that my wife isn't invited to the ceremony or reception, none of it. 

I was expecting it tbh, and had already been over the potential conversation in my head (as you do) so as to hopefully counter any possible emotional reaction. It was all fairly civil, although I did state that if my wife wasn't invited then I wouldn't be bringing our baby either. Just me. She was fine with this. Which was slightly unexpected as she dotes over my baby whenever she sees her and I assumed she would be more upset. But I guess it just enforced in my mind that my wife hadn't been invited because my sister didn't want anything at all to potentially 'set her off' on her big day, and that not having my baby there as a consequence was fair enough. 

We're now fast approaching the big day and I've just been messaged by my sister asking if I'd reconsider and take my baby along as our mother is once again deeply upset that a member of the family not being present... obviously meaning my baby, no mention of my wife. 

My wife has no love for my sister anymore and thinks it's all bullshit to get her own way. 

I wanted to talk directly to my mother to discover the extent of her issue... but the last time I did that was what led to us falling out with my sister before our wedding - as my mother repeated some stuff I'd said to her about my sister which prompted a slanging match between my sister and I over the phone. 

Anyway, I've replied to say that my decision stands. But now I feel like I'm an asshole. Am I The Asshole?

<<<<EDIT>>>> I probably should have stated originally that my awesome wife is totally fine with me going, as there's no love lost between them and she'll enjoy a day to herself playing on her mobile while the baby naps. She even persuaded me to attend when I said I shouldn't. She's commenting as u/mrs_tumble_ , if anyone wants to let her know how awful her husband is ;)

<<<<EDIT 2>>>> A few people have asked for more info about why my sister and wife don't get along, despite being fine for many years... A few reasons really, each sillier than the last because it's all a bunch of shite tied to the BPD... The most memorable reason was because my wife took a picture of her knowing that she didn't like having her picture taken (which in my wife's defence had been fine for years, with my sister appearing in lots of photos. She just suddenly decided this occasion was too far and got shitty about it. She just started being really cold towards my wife! Although no one actually found out that this was the reason until years later)!"
"AITA for not letting my Girlfriend give my co-workers Hot Cocoa? | So, some background. I work in a sales office near where I live with my GF (who works as a teacher). If you live in the Northeast of the US, you know we got a lot of snow last night. So my girlfriend had the day off, but I didn't. Around 11 she started texting me asking how many people were in my office. I told her. Come lunch, she tells me she's outside and she has hot cocoa for everyone in my office. I told her I didn't really like that she just showed up and that I didn't know if anyone would want any. I go around my office and find that about half of them wanted some so I go back to my girlfriend in her car and tell her that I'll take the cocoa and pass it around. She tells me that she wants to come in too and let them know that she got it for them. She's never met a single person in my office so I told her I felt uncomfortable with her showing up and suddenly meeting everyone. She got really mad at this and started asking why I couldn't just appreciate the surprise. I told her it would be like if I just showed up at her school, and she told me that there isn't any security at my office so it's probably fine. I didn't budge. She got mad and left. I took the cocoa and told everyone that got one that my GF bought them, but she's still pissed at me and I'm still upset she doesn't seem to understand my side.

Am I overreacting here?


Edit: A few more important notes. I'm in my early 20s and the newest person in my office (been there for under 6 months), my office is entirely people in their 30s and up. Most of them are married with children but I have yet to meet a single spouse. This is a big part of why I thought it would be inappropriate for her to come in.


Edit 2: I also feel like I shouldn't have to say this, but I'm not cheating on my GF. I have no secret office romances.




Edit 3/ Update: hey guys, Asshole here. So I spoke to my GF last night and cleared everything up. I apologized for not being more immediately receptive to the nice treat and she apologized for putting me in an awkward situation. We talked about whether she would like to come in today and just say meet some of my co-workers. I told her I would ask my boss. 

He told me that while the gifts were appreciated, I should wait till our Christmas party to introduce my GF.

In conclusion, I've learned that all of you are wrong and that you should never trust Reddit. Also I just want to give a big shout out to Christina Applegate and all the guys in this thread who advised my GF to break up with me."
"AITA for being annoyed at how a former crush [24F] tries to check up on me [22M]? | I've been friends with a girl A for about four years at this point. I had a crush on her for three years. We met in college through me joining a fraternity she was associated with. She was taken for most of the time I knew her.

2 years after, I became introverted. When this happened, I unintentionally started cutting off contact with people in my fraternity (stopped showing up to events, quit the fraternity, etc.) However,  A would hit me up and we would hang out. We got close during this, but I realized that I might be infatuated with her due to most daily interactions being with her.

Post-grad, both of us ended up in different, yet nearby cities. She broke up with her boyfriend early in, but I didn't attempt to court her because she was obviously hurting and recovering. However, we hung out since I drove to her city for other business.

A year after her break-up, I had a life-changing incident where I ended up hospitalized (health-related). When it happened, the only thing I could think about was A and how much I liked her.  I took a few days to cool off and think about my feelings. I kept on re-evaluating this, as I wanted to make sure that my past infatuation wasn't talking, and that I wasn't doing a ""spur of the moment"" decision. I concluded that I really did like her unconditionally.

I confessed. She responded with a ""I haven't thought about dating anyone ever since my break-up"". That hurt more because I felt like she was leaving me in limbo rather than just rejecting me. Regardless, we agreed that we would stay friends and talk.

However, things didn't return to normal. I'd strike up conversation and she'll leave me on read. At one point, I ended up in her city to hang out with friends including her. Eventually she ended up in my car drunk, and was telling friends in the car about attractive guys she would date. She was clearly considering the dating scene, I found it a bit hurtful.

The thing that has been aggravating me post-confession is her ""checking-up"" on me. What I mean is that she will send me a text here or there. Our conversations boil down to her asking how I'm doing and trying to solve problems in my life. Once she's done giving her solution to my problems, she never responds to my messages afterwards (and I'm talking messages like ""how are you doing"". I have a feeling that she thinks I have depression due to my introversion, and is doing these ""check-ups"" so she doesn't feel guilty about not contacting me. They feel fake, like she's just messaging to make sure I'm okay and to self-validate herself by trying to solve my problems without being in my shoes and understanding the problems. And by problems, I don't mean mental illness. I have no record of mental illness, and it just feels like she wants to feel good about helping a ""loner"". AITA for thinking this way about her ""check-ups""?"
"AITA for refusing to paying for my neighbor’s dog’s vet bills | So for a bit of background, I live in an apartment building and it’s a small community. I’ve become acquainted with everyone, it’s mainly elderly and disabled people but everyone is friendly. 

I noticed a woman with a large husky when I first moved in. Her name is Daisy and is a total sweetie but very hyper and has endless energy. Her owner is sort of disabled and doesn’t take Daisy on walks, rarely even takes her out potty. I love dogs but work long hours so it wouldn’t be fair for me to get a dog. 

As soon as I saw Daisy and how overwhelmed her owner was by her energy, I offered to walk her for her. I go on long walks nearly every day anyways and thought I might as well take Daisy with me! I want to be clear that I volunteered to do this, I am *NOT* getting paid to walk her dog. 

Fast forward to two days ago, I’ve been walking Daisy for a couple months and we both love our walks. She loves when I come up and get her and we walk along a pond and she stares at the ducks and geese. It’s a lot of fun. Well, it was. 

When I took her out on a walk a couple days ago, I let her drink from the pond like I always do, but there was some glass there and she cut her foot. It was pretty deep and she started bleeding. I immediately took her to the vet and called her owner and she met me there. 

Daisy had to get her foot wrapped up and I think she got stitches but I don’t recall all the details. The total cost of the vet was $227.00. As soon as the vet tells my neighbor this, she looks at me and we both are like wow that’s a lot. 

She then asks me if she wants me to pay now or write her a check later. I’m stunned and don’t really know what to say but I tell her that I’m not paying this vet bill. It’s her dog, I just walk her and I’m really heartbroken that she got hurt but I’m not going to pay this vet bill. 

She got super defensive and angry and went on a rant,  she said that if I didn’t pay this bill, she will take me to court. I told her that I was doing her a favor walking her dog, but that ends now. 

She immediately changed her tune and begged me to pay the bill because she couldn’t afford it right now and to please keep walking Daisy because she loves me so much. I firmly told her no and I would have to think about continuing to walk Daisy. 

The next day, I ran into a mutual friend on the elevator and she said that my neighbor was telling everyone that I cut up Daisy’s paw and wouldn’t pay for it. I asked what my friend thought and she didn’t believe I did it on purpose but I need to accept responsibility since I was put in charge of the dog and she got hurt on my watch.

I still don’t think I should be the one paying for her vet’s bills and now everyone in my building thinks I cut up dogs for fun. AITA? 

Tl;dr- I walked my neighbors dog for her, sweet pup got hurt, vet bill = $$$, I refuse to pay, my neighbor gossips more than my 14 year old niece.

***
I’ve been reading the comments and I do agree with the people who were saying I was the asshole for not at least offering to pay half of the bill. I offered to take the dog for walks. 

I should add that she is not disabled or elderly and works full time. She puts potty pads down for her dog so she only has to take her out once a day. I’m disgusted and saddened by how she takes care of Daisy. That’s one of the main reasons I offered to take her for walks. No dog deserves to live like that. 

I sent her a message today saying I’ll pay for half of the bills. However, once daisy recovers, I will not be put in this situation again, as I am not financially stable at the moment. I told her I won’t be walking Daisy anymore and that it breaks my heart. 

She said that I wasn’t being fair to Daisy and that I wouldn’t have to pay the vet bill if I just continue to walk her. I’m not sure what to do. Maybe if I get a contract where I’m not held liable if something is to happen to Daisy. Her owner is begging me to keep walking her. 

Anyways, I agree that ESH (except for Daisy of course)"
"AITA for getting my neighbors arrested over weed? | So let me preface this, I don't agree with what happened as I believe recreational use of marijuana should be legal. 

I've been living at my current complex for about a year, it's a very small complex where everyone is cramped up together. So smells travel quickly.

We have a group down the hall that always constantly stink up the hallways, and subsequently my apartment, with the skunk smell of weed. I've initially left messages asking them to try to filter it better or at least do it somewhere else. We don't have windows we can open, so there's no way them or I can let it out.

After still dealing with it for a month, I spoke to management and all they did was say ""no smoking on premises"" in an email.


Smells persisted.


Now I have family come by alot, and I do my best to give good impressions....but with the constant smell they don't want to visit anymore since they think the complex is full of druggies.

So I did the unthinkable, I filed a complaint with police on kids smoking weed. They stopped by, and essentially did a sweep of the complex. Note, this IS NOT what I requested. I just wanted them to tell the kids to do it elsewhere or just stop smoking in the complex.

They busted two different tennants, one was in the process of lighting some up and apparently had a personal bag big enough to be considered distributable.

The second Tennant was actively dealing from what I overheard, he was busted with a few bricks but did not actively smoke.

AITA for essentially ruining these people's lives all because of a bad smell? I tried to tell the officers I didn't want them arrested, just to be spoken to to stop or go elsewhere to do it."
"WIBTA if I ask my step father that if he’s gonna mow my lawn to mow it shorter? | This past month my step dad has taken it upon himself to mow my lawn when he mows his. I haven’t asked him to, he just does it out of the kindness of his heart, but I don’t like how long he leaves it. He mows it at almost the highest setting so literally 3 days later it needs mowing again because the weeds sprout right back up past the grass. I want to ask him to mow it shorter if he’s gonna mow it but my wife says that’s an asshole thing to do because its not like we are paying him to do it, he’s doing it for free. But my thinking is that it’s literally a push of a button, it’s not gonna make it harder to mow so it shouldn’t be a big deal. So he mows it and 3 or 4 days later I mow it again at a shorter lengtg

note: My stepdad lives next door and the mower belongs to both he and I but we keep it in my garage."
"AITA for buying my little sister a CD ""Queen's Greatest Hits"" for her birthday? | A bit of context here.

When my little sis was younger, she used to love Queen because Mum got us Wayne's World (if you know this Mike Myers film, you can understand).

I thought that since my little sister loved the Bohemian Rhapsody song by Queen, I decided to get her a full album of all the best songs.

I got it wraped and gave it to her on her birthday. She said thank you, but that I could have picked a better present. I went home that night feeling kind of annoyed. I put a lot of thought into my present, and felt like it wasn't really appreciated. 

Am I the asshole for being annoyed at her about this?"
"AITA for being mad at my boyfriend after he implied his sister is better-looking than me? | We were all hanging out, and talking about high school (we're all in college now, but we went to the same HS together). I was joking about how his sister did better than me in most of our classes, and my boyfriend says ""well, teachers always go easier on the prettier girls."" 

Obviously, that was mostly a joke so even though when I realized the implication I was a little stung for a second. But I brushed it off because, whatever, no one was being serious.

Later, when it was just the two of us, I half-jokingly reminded him of what he said and asked if he really thought she was prettier than me, and he just sort of laughed awkwardly and didn't answer. I admit it was kind of petty but at this point I was feeling a little insecure, so I got a bit more serious and pushed and asked if that was what he *really* thought.

And he said ""well you're my girlfriend, of course I think you're beautiful but like...objectively?""

I got really mad and stormed out. He's texted me saying sorry, but also saying 'aren't you being kind of silly?' which made me angrier. I haven't gotten back to him yet."
"AITA for jokingly making fun of my friend’s heritage? | I know it sounds bad, but I have a friend who is of Irish descent, and we have an inside joke about Irish people being a minority. I sometimes call him a “spud shucker” and he’ll laugh and say “no, I’m a spud fucker!”

Well anyway we had an interaction like the one mentioned above in front of some of our friends and one of my female friends said “You know I’m Irish, right?” She didn’t say anything else or make a big deal out of it, but looking back I think she may have been offended."
"AITA for not accepting my relationships anniversary date? | My gf and I dated for a couple years and we took a month split to focus on ourselves and grow up a bit independently. A couple weeks ago we started talking again and a few days ago was our year anniversary from our prior relationship and she got upset that I didn’t acknowledge it. I told her that date was from our previous relationship and not our current so I would not classify that as our anniversary. AITA?

edit: If i am TA, what can I do to justify?"
"WIBTA if I asked my professor to take control of her classroom? | Throwaway in case my classmates use reddit. 

I'm taking a College Algebra class as a prerequisite before moving onto higher math. It's mostly serving as a refresher for me, since I graduated about a decade ago and I've always been fairly comfortable with math. Others in the class are struggling and have lots of issues/questions. My professor does it as a part time job.

One student in the class seems to be causing a lot of issues. I'm fairly certain he's on the spectrum and he doesn't mean anything bad by it, but the negative result is the same. A few of the things he does, which I think harm the class, are

* He constantly interrupts the professor in the middle of her explanations, so we don't get the full concept as one cohesive statement.
* He says the answer, about 50% of which are right, before anybody else can participate and answer themselves. When he gets it wrong, the professor then starts correcting him without calling on someone else to participate and work through the problem.
* He yells out how easy certain problems are, despite others having questions about it and often getting the wrong answers himself. Others are leaving the class without understanding the concepts and I think it's because they're discouraged from asking questions about ""easy"" problems.
* He consistently asks the professor to not move on from slides because he wants to copy every slide in its entirety, despite the professor repeatedly telling him it's available online.

As a result of the above, we cover about 20% of the material in the first half of the class and have to rush the final 80% of material in the last half of the class. This leads to even more issues with the harder material. 

So would I be the asshole if I asked her to take control and not let him dominate the class?"
"AITA for keeping pictures of my girlfriend | Edit: if you want an update for some reason here it is: I am allowed to keep all the old pictures and any new ones and she was only upset because she was feeling self conscious about the pictures because she thought she looked bad in them. 

So my girlfriend wanted to take pictures with me today like always but I saved one where she looked “ugly” so she opened up my phone and saw my albums right on top are albums of her labeled “my cutie” and “my cutie’s booty” the first being pictures of us or just her that are nice and parent friendly and the second is a bit more revealing pictures that I use for oiling the rifle.  

I explained to her I had it because sometimes I want to jerk off and I don’t want to bother her or she’s just not around. She got very upset and deleted the album for me and told me to call her next time I want to have some inspiration but also specified that next time might be a little while. I’m gonna be honest, if I called her or texted her every time I wanted to explode the volcano she’d probably break up with me. It’s often. I explained this to her too and she didn’t seem to believe me but I work from home and have plenty of free time because my job is easy and I use that free time to do what I feel is needed. 

So am I the asshole and also maybe some advice?

Edit: some people asked so, all the pictures are taken by her and sent to me over text. Also **they aren’t nudes**, they’re usually only pictures of her ass. She doesn’t like to take naked pictures because she’s self conscious."
"AITA for not wanting to go grocery shopping with my housemates? | I’m a broke college student (18F) who lives with 3 girls (20F) who honestly (and no offense) are overweight and kinda bordering on obesity. I met them online because I didn’t know anyone and they were cool at first and we go to the same college but it’s obvious that I don’t fit in with them because they’re all childhood friends and I’m younger and new.

A few days ago, they approached me and asked if I want to join them on for weekly grocery store trips to buy everything together and split the cost evenly. Their reasoning behind this is that we wouldn’t have to worry about eating someone else’s food on accident because everything will be for everyone (like a family). I told them I don’t think it’s a fair idea because my grocery hauls consist of almost entirely healthy foods while they like to buy a lot of frozen food and junk food to snack on and share with their friends when they get the munchies. I’m also trying to save money and buy only the things that I need so it wouldn’t be fair to have to pay for 1/4 of the total cost when I don’t want to eat any of their food which honestly adds up to quite a bit.

They accused me of calling them fat and bad at managing their money. They’re even telling their other friends who are always over that I’m a shitty friend for fat-shaming them, refusing to share my food, and not putting any effort into being friends with them. So, AITA?"
"AITA for telling a missionary to fuck off? | I was walking with a friend in the NYC subway system and had to pass through a corridor to transfer trains. A person was standing in the middle of the hallway with a headset/PA system, preaching about Jesus and handing out pamphlets. She looked at me and tried to give me a pamphlet. I said ""fuck off"" under my breath as I walked by.


My friend told me that what I said was really messed up and overly aggressive. I responded that I think trying to convert  people to another religion is messed up. I was raised Jewish so proselytization makes me very uncomfortable for a number of reasons. For the record I am not religious and this does not come from a place of feeling that I was born into the ""right"" religion. It's more that I see proselytization as a form of imperialism and I find it gross that people are actively trying to ""conquer"" me, even if they think they're saving my soul.


Another factor that my friend pointed out was that the missionary was a woman of color and I am a white/white passing man. I argued that in this context, she was an advocating member of the largest religion on earth and I was a religious minority.


Am I the asshole?


Edit 1: spelling

Edit 2: I accept my judgement. Next time I will opt for a silent eye-roll."
"WIBTA for waiting to tip until my order is delivered? | I  order food delivery 1-2 times a month when I’m at work using a well known food delivery app. As part of the ordering/payment option you choose what tip to give. As I have an odd request for delivery (requires driver to park and then walk to my location, as I can’t leave the immediate area where I work) I always leave a good tip (20-25%, and my orders are usually in the $150 range as I’m ordering for a group). Well, the last 10 times I’ve ordered the driver has not brought the entire order. Usually one entree or multiple appetizers are missing. As work is hectic I don’t usually have the chance to check the order when it shows up, and only find out when things slow down and I have time to eat. I think the driver should be checking the order before they leave the restaurants, but they clearly are not. Tonight really pissed me off because the driver told me as he was giving me my food that the restaurant called while he was on route to deliver to say they had not given him an item and I would need to call the restaurant or the app customer service to pursue a refund.

So my new plan is to leave the lowest tip the app will allow and put in the order comment that I will pay the rest of the tip in cash when they show up with my entire order. WIBTA for this plan?

EDIT: I expected to get a bit of an education about how the delivery system actually works, as I thought there would be some drivers who would comment. FWIW each order that was wrong came from a different restaurant, so assuming the info the drivers are providing is correct in my locale then 10 different restaurants screwed up. I live in a place where the orders aren’t 100% secure (eg tonight’s order came in single white plastic bags, like what you get at a grocery store), and they most commonly come in 1-2 paper bags like what you get at a grocery store, and the bags aren’t stapled shut or anything.

EDIT 2: different drivers every time too"
"AITA for refusing an elderly relative's birthday gift? | So last thursday it was my 18th, all my family gathered, including my stepmom's family. My stepmom's mom, ""Sharon"" hands me an envelope. I open the envelope along with the other gifts, it's a lottery ticket. Fine by me I figured, and then Sharon chimes in telling me that if I win over 100 dollars I have to share it with my (non-biological) cousins and my sister. This would mean sharing the lottery ticket 6-ways, so I'd come out with nothing even if I'd won.

I'm honestly flabbergasted at this, who shares a lottery ticket 6-ways and I refuse to scratch it. I won't accept a gift with some sort of tacked on rule, and she seems pretty salty about it. 

When it's all said and done I tell my dad, who wasn't in the room what happened. He agreed that it was ridiculous and we started joking around when my stepmom came in. She realized we were laughing about her mom and the lottery ticket and gave us both nasty looks, like we did her some big wrong. 

Am I (and dad) really the assholes for thinking this lottery ticket thing is complete bullshit, and for joking about it? And am I an asshole for refusing to keep the ticket, and giving it back"
"WIBTA for not helping my sister who also taught me how to generate money? | I used to be a shut-in from 19-23 but main reason progress of not shut-in today is because my oldest sister as not give up on me while everyone else has. She has helped get the right doctor, therapist, medication and so on. To the point I live independently, work part time and have a normal life.

That not important. The thing is a sister used to work for a commodity trading firm and taught me how to trade the future market specifically the oil market while helping my mental state. I've made to huge progress that I'm making high five figures and in a rare occasions a six figures a some months.

I have been informing my sister of my progress and she been making jokes about helping her make a down payment for a house in a future. She never directly asked but she been hinting it but I don't went to do it. Is this wrong?"
"AITA for not ""letting"" my brother get married before me? | This happened a couple years ago but it's something that keeps coming up & causing me anxiety/discomfort.

When my husband & I got engaged (it was like April), we had been dating for about 8 years & it was not a surprise to anyone that we were going to get married. We do the whole tell the parents thing & they are all excited, later that day I realize that we hadn't told my older brother so we call him up & share the good news. At first he's excited & then asks when we are thinking about getting married. Since we had only been engaged for about a week we hadn't really set a date & I mentioned a date that was about two years in the future but clearly stated that we didn't really know since we hadn't been engaged long & had to plan.

My brother then says ""oh well it looks like I may beat you guys down the aisle."" I laughed but when he didn't laugh as well I stopped & said ""wait, you're seeing someone?"" He apparently was, they had their first date on Valentine's day (February) I kinda brushed off his comment about getting married before me & told him that I'd love to meet & get to know her. Especially since she was the first girl he ever dated & ""brought home.""

Couple months (~July) Husband/I set a wedding date that's ~9 months in the future. We also meet the GF, I think a good fit for OB. In August, we get a call from OB saying that he & GF are engaged. Wow, congrats! Ask about the story & all that, but I never really thought to ask about a date (I was admittedly too wrapped up in planning to be considerate).

2 weeks later OB calls me & asks if I'd be ok with him getting married before me. I was (stupidly) shocked & said I'd have to talk to Husband about it since I was unable to process it at the time. That day I went over to visit my husband & asked him what he thought & shared how I thought it was crazy that OB&GF wanted to get married so quickly after beginning to date. Husband wasn't ok with them getting married before us & agreed w/me that it seemed fast. I also spoke to our mom/older sister they both agreed that I was within my rights to say no if I was uncomfortable about it since he asked.

2 days later I called OB up & told him that it did make me uncomfortable but if they really wanted to get married before us then I couldn't stop them.

They ended up setting a date for 2 weeks after my wedding.

Ever since OB/his wife have made comments often about how they ""really wanted to get married in February"" (I didn't realize that they wanted to get married on their 1 year anniversary, which I do feel bad about) & have heard them bemoan the fact that they couldn't have the flowers they wanted for something like that.

Am I an asshole for letting my feelings known or should I have swallowed them? If YTA, what (if anything) can I do to make it up to them? Thanks for your thoughts & harsh judgments.

EDIT: Husband and I started dating at 14 which is why it took us ""so long"" to get engaged.  We were engaged by 22, married by 23."
"AITA for wanting my friend to pay me for catfishing with my photos | Throwaway for obvious reasons, mandatory apology for the bad formatting.

I (19f) have a friend, lets call him Thomas, basically hes been on a paypig website, ( men will pay money to have women insult them or humiliate them) on this website its mainly anonymous, a fake screen name and a few photos, and there aren't many gay guys he can profit from, that being said hes asked to use my pictures to essentially catfish these guys. At first i didn't have an issue with this, he said we'd split the profit 50/50. He would ask me to send pictures with my finger on my nose, things like that because the guy wanted to know if it was really me etc. No big deal.

Hes made about 2000 dollars since this has started, and we've split it evenly. I asked him to stop using my photos because the requests for photos he'd been asking me for were getting extreme and making me uncomfortable.( pictures of me trying to lick my toes things like that) He agreed and understood.

Im just finding out that hes been getting photos off my snapchat stories, and my instagram to use and send to these guys while still making money. I asked him about it and he said hed send me 100 dllars out of the 1000 he made. I asked for the 500, because A) Its me in the photos and B) because i asked him to stop. He sent me the money and has been really passive aggressive.

AITA?"
"AITA: for packing lots of food for my son during school days? | I got a note from my son's teacher (he's in kindergarten) yesterday saying that she would appreciate it if I didn't pack him ""these lavish snacks"" because snack time is meant to be something little to tide them off before lunch and before pick up time. And they should be able to ""easily fit in a small zip lock bag.""  She urged me to make the fancy stuff for lunches because my son is the only one in class with an assortment of snacks. 


Here's my dilemma. My son has a voracious appetite, but eats extremely healthy. I don't make anything fancy for school, and I pack his snacks in containers rather than bags so we can re use them. I feel like maybe part of the problem is the fact that I want to re use containers (10 plastic bags a week adds up and is unnessary waste ) and the other problem is that i give him more than one thing? 



This is what his typical food intake looks like at school
Morning snack: hard boiled egg, yogurt tube, some berries or a banana and water. Easily something he can wolf down in the 10 mins allowed. 

Lunch box: personal chicken pot pie (or something warm and small) veggies like snow peas, broccoli, carrots. Sliced apple or fruit cup, and maybe some crackers or gold fish crackers. With milk from the cafeteria or water. 

Lunch snack: a mini bagle split into 2 turned into those pizza bite things that i toast up before school, and some bell peppers. Or string cheese and a can of smoked oysters. 

And the thing is. He eats pretty much everything! There may be a few carrots left over, or a bite of apple left but everything else is devoured. And he is really good about saving his leftover food so we can give it to the worms or hermit crabs. 



So am i the asshole for making what i believe is a reasonable amount of food for my son while other kids just have like 3 apple slices in the am and a cheese stick in the afternoon? 


I dont want my kid to be "" that kid."" In class but i also dont want him to be hungry. He has a hard time focusing and becomes extremely hangry if he is hungry."
"AITA for being upset after my SO said they felt physically abused? | Some backstory. 


Last week I tried to take my own life. I overdosed on pills. Don't really want to share anymore details. I have ppd.

We have a 3 month old daughter. 

Today we received a letter from CPS, as the cops informed them. And a flyer. On this flyer you could see a crying child and it had these big ass letters saying things like ""child abuse"", ""neglect"", and ""physical abuse"". Obviously none of that was happening in my case. The letter said that they are not worried and not taking any action or want to see/talk to us. I handed him the letter and flyer after I read them and he also read both of them. 

This evening, me and my SO were in bed, doing the usual playfighting before being intimate (which never happened). Halfway through playfighting he says ""I feel physically abused"". It triggered me a lot. He was saying it as a joke. I was not hurting him or doing anything out of the ordinary. I was laughing the entire time but as soon as he said that I just got angry. I said ""Maybe you should call CPS"". And went downstairs to sleep on the sofa.

Just a note, he has never in our time together mentioned physical abuse, the words have never passed his lips. I still don't understand why he said it today.  

Now he keeps pestering me. Am I really the asshole here?"
"AITA for not wearing shoes. | so I live in a pretty lax area and a decent amount of the people (me included) do not wear shoes. I never wear them and only own one pair of shoes and 0 pairs of socks. 
only time I wear shoes is when I know a certain store will refuse my service or if I'm with my parents as they are against me going barefoot anywhere. 

I had my friend over and we went out to the mall and she kept on commenting that I was disgusting for not wearing shoes. we had an argument over it when I pointed out a bunch of people who where also not wearing shoes, but she still thought I was disgusting. 

she then told some friends who took her side and have been telling me how disgusting I am for going barefoot. 

AITA?"
"AITA for cutting my friend out of my life and not telling her why? | TL;DR: Bestie treated me like shit when I got engaged before she did. We work together but I don't talk to her and don't feel the need to explain why. 

""Ruby"" and I were friends from 5th to 7th grade. Ruby didn't talk to me for 9 years, then sent me a message out of the blue. She introduced me to her boyfriend ""Jake"" and his best friend ""Nick."" Nick and I started dating soon after. 

Ruby comes from a *very* rich family. Ruby is a very obnoxious person, and has always been self-centered, but she can be generous and a lot of fun. 

Nick and I got engaged. When we got back from our trip where we got engaged, Ruby wanted to go out to lunch. At lunch, Ruby complained that Jake hadn't proposed to her yet even though they'd been together longer. 

Ruby made Jake propose to her. Their wedding was September, Nick's and mine in December. Ruby asked me to be her Maid of Honor. I felt pressured to ask her to be my MoH, so I did what most people with the moral backbone of a chocolate eclair would do, and asked her to be my MoH. 

Ruby and I went shopping for her bridal shower, which her parents had offered to pay for, but at the end of her shopping spree she told me I was paying. I had about $150 to my name at that time and spent most of it on her.

The day of her wedding she was awful. I just kept my distance and did my job as MoH. 

A few days after her wedding, I told Ruby I applied for a CNA job at the hospital where she works. I am in nursing school. She is a new RN. There aren't many hospital CNA jobs in our area. She told me she hoped I got the job.

I got the job. Ruby was polite but distant. After a while, I asked why, and Ruby said ""I just don't want to be seen as playing favorites with the CNAs."" That hurt a lot. A lot of CNAs and RNs hang out outside of work on our unit, so it's not like it'd be weird. After that, I mostly stopped talking to her. 

I didn't ask her to do anything for my bridal shower. 

The day before my wedding she kept texting and calling. I was stressed and busy so I ignored her.

Later that day Ruby confronted me. She wanted to talk about her MoH speech. I finally put my foot down and told her she wouldn't be having a speech. Ruby is always sneaking in a cutdown and I didn't want to hear that at my wedding.

The day of my wedding, I had an allergic reaction in one eye. Ruby told my makeup artist to do me last and keep my brushes separate because I had something contagious. 

A month after the wedding, she sent me a snapchat and said ""things have been awkward since the wedding, I'm ready to talk when you are"" and I didn't reply. I don't feel like I owe her an explanation.

Nick thinks I should just talk to her and be friends again, since he and Jake are still pretty good friends, but I don't even *want* to be friends anymore. 

Some people are shocked that I don't talk to Ruby anymore, and some people think I should've dumped her years ago. I don't even know if I'm in the right anymore. So, tell me, Reddit, AITA?"
"AITA for lying about how much I make to get more money from my new company | Without giving too much detail (all numbers here are fudged a little), it is customary for the industry im in for employer s to ask how much you made at your previous position. They can never verify it though unless they see your checks because of the nature of the industry and the bonus structure/capital gains/ etc. 

&#x200B;

I currently make $175k at company A and want to make at least $225k at company B. company B asked me how much i make and i said $200k + 20k bonus and im looking for $225k  company B asked me to provide proof (this is unheard of, so is company B asking company A becuaee company A would never give that info). 

&#x200B;

I gave them my bonus  which was actually $20k but then they asked for a paystub of my biweekly . i then used photoshop to put in the amount corresponding to $200k/yr on my $175k  and company B came back with $210k base and bonus on similar scale as company A.

"AITA for yelling at my mom for giving my baby a ”comfort” bottle? | My mom is retired and watches my daughter (18 months) for me while I’m at work. I do appreciate it a lot and she never wants money. The thing is, I don’t always feel like she fully takes me seriously as a parent. I’m single and I struggled a bit in the beginning and I’m not sure my mom ever fully let that go. 

Here’s what happened this time. I tried very hard to wean my daughter off of the bottle when she was a year old and communicated with my mother a lot about the switch to sippy cups. 

I came home early the other day because of a huge power outage at my job. I see my daughter on the couch happily sucking her bottle. I confronted my mother about it who said she only gives it to her “when she gets hysterical”. I flipped out and I did raise my voice. 

What’s super annoying is that I know my daughter is smart enough to know what’s going on too since she never even cries to me for one. So basically it’s been their little secret. 

Anyway my mom is now mad at me and barely speaking to me. But I feel like anyone would have been angry in my position? AITA for how I reacted?"
"AITA for telling a friend’s friend that he couldn’t keep the “jackpot” that he hit on my antique slot machine? (About $700) | I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

Over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I’d never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

Well a friend’s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I’d be happy to give him his quarters back if he’d asked but I’m not a casino and while I’m not destitute, I can’t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he’d be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

So was I the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

Edit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because I've been banned.

Edit2: wow since I’m a “baby gangster” who has been running an “illegal gaming operation” (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. I’m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

Edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

If the moderators allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I’ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the “winner” thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN’T be this dramatic in real life...I’m a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I’m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don’t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don’t  in the process.

Edit4: well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I’ll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why I can’t “afford” to give it to him. 

Say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that’s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You’d say yes. Now let’s say a guy you’ve never met says “hey I just put .80 into your change jar, now I’m taking the whole thing.” You would say no. It’s how I’ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. I’ve given people quarters to play, I’ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I’ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That’s a nickel a day. that’s not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


Edit5: a good question:

>INFO Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

No he did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

Edit6: another good question

>Also, need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard here?


I would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

Edit7: 

>INFO
We need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine

So this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if I'm way off base.

Edit8: this is the best yta take so far and I can't let it get buried.

> I really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you’ll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

Edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say ""your edits make you YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?""  I truly can accept the YTA votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. I wasn't profiting off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. I never cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. As an example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

Edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>I bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


Edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy.


Edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub. Fuck the moderators. And fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. Most of you however were cool."
"AITA for expecting more than half the pizza? | I'm going to order a pizza tomorrow. My wife doesn't really like me getting pizza because it's unhealthy, and it's expensive here in Japan. I get that, but it's a taste of my home country that I love, as she knows. I found a coupon and she gave me permission to buy it and bring it back for our dinner tomorrow. I'm going to order a large not because it's a good value but because I like eating a lot of pizza.

&#x200B;

Sounds great, right? But she says half of the pizza is mine, half is hers. I do not agree to this, but she expects it. I am taller and bigger than her. I eat more than her. I think 60% mine, 40% hers is a fair ratio given our respective bodies. I've brought this up before, but she has repeatedly demanded that she deserves half the pie, as we are supposed to be equals.

&#x200B;

I order pizza about 4 times a year. I also take her to a nice sushi place 4 times a year, because I know that she really likes it. I order cheap plates off the kid's menu, because that's my taste in sushi. I encourage her to order the expensive plates with nice fish because I know she'll appreciate it.

&#x200B;

She still insists on half the pizza being hers. My plan as always is to let her eat her fill, which will surely be less than half of the pizza, then eat the remainder of her self-declared half until I myself am full and satisfied. She will have to eat natto for breakfast the next day instead of leftover pizza, and I don't plan to feel bad about it.

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole here?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice so far. I don't agree with all of it, but I appreciate it and am bringing it on board. I have been working on communicating better with my wife tonight (pizza night is tomorrow, so there's still time to improve this situation). As of now, she agrees that maybe it's worth the cost for me to get a large all of my own, and  her a small of her own, despite the steep costs."
"AITA for not wanting my sister to join my dad and I on our walks? | I (26f) used to not have a close relationship to either of my parents, but having temporarily moved home our relationship has improved significantly. 

This spring, me and my dad started going our for long walks with  map and compass, basically doing casual orientation, and I've come to value these times immensely. My dad and I are very alike and share the same humour etc, and I'm very happy to have gotten closer to him. 

My sister(37f) and I are nothing alike, except the fact that we both have aspergers. She's 11 years older than me and besides us being siblings,  we have few things in common. I won't lie, there is a bit of resentment from my side because her very obvious asperger diagnosis is the reason no one ever noticed mine until I fought to get a diagnosis for myself as an adult. I know it should be (and mostly is) directed towards my parents, but still.

So that being said, my sister also loves walking in the forest and spends most of her free time either at the gym or in the forest. Last year she had some trouble with one wrist, which only progressed to get worse over time. It was recently discovered that she has aggressive reumatism and will basically lose all movement in her wrist. 

Obviously this is tough for her because she will be unable to go to the gym as usual and even with proper help it'll take long time before she can go back. She doesn't have a car nor a license, so my parents usually drive her to her appointments. This also means she can't get to other places to walk in the forest, while my dad and I usually drive to various locations to walk. 

Now my mom has suggested we bring my sister for our walks, because it would make her very happy. I know she really wants to. Problem is, I really don't.  These walks are for me and my dad, they are our bonding time basically. I don't want my sister there because I don't like spending time with her, but I feel selfish and guilty for it. I haven't said no, but I'm not sure I'd even get a say in it or if my mom would just decide it for us. I don't know if my dad wants it either. It feels like we are obliged to, though.

So, AITA for not wanting my sister to join for our walks?  Should I just bite the bullet and let her join to make her happy?"
"AITA for telling my wife she doesn’t have post-partum depression? | I feel awful about it, but. 

So, my wife gave birth to a healthy baby girl a month and a half ago. I wouldn’t exchange the world for my daughter. She’s my first daughter, but my wife has twin sons from another marriage. However, ever since she gave birth, she’s been... neglectful.

I don’t mean “she won’t do the housework”, but more so, she’s not doing anything at all. I’m taking care of the baby, I’m doing the housework, etc. etc. When I asked her if she could /do/ something, she said that she had post-partum depression, and therefore can’t take care of our daughter. I told her, we can go to therapy if she wants, but she refused, because it’s not that serious. I was initially annoyed, but went like fuck it, she’s a new mum, pregnancy hurts.

 Yesterday she sat me down, and told me that she was going to go for a month abroad with her girlfriends, to party and “loosen up” so it would get her out of the emotional slump. Now, I’ve pretty much used up all my holidays, and can’t stay at home to take care of my daughter; so I asked her would take care of our daughter. She told me to hire someone; or have our sons do it.

I flipped out, I told her she doesn’t have PPD, she’s just fucking neglectful, and eight year olds are in no way or form supposed to be taking care of a newborn, and besides, they have a school to fucking go to. I told her if she goes on this trip, it’s a divorce; I love her, but I cannot abide by this. 

Now she’s mad and won’t talk to me, and I’m sleeping on the couch. 

AITA here?

EDITS/INFO: 

1. I don’t know how she was with the twins, they’re my step-children. I might ask her family if they know. 

2. She has done literally nothing to our baby girl.

3. Her PPD is self-diagnosed (I think I saw a comment about that?)

4. Sleeping on the couch is the least of my worries right now. But the baby was planned; we both wanted (and felt ready) for a child together.

4. I’ll talk with her tonight, and tell her that if she wants to go on a holiday with her friends (which I still hate the idea of), she has to go to a psychiatrist, and talk with him about this first.

5. Until then, I’ll keep the daughter with my mum when I’m at work. Someone mentioned possibility of hurting our baby, and I don’t think she’s like this, but it’s to put my heart at ease."
"AITA for trying to get my self-proclaimed ""emotionless"" boyfriend to open up to me more? | My boyfriend has always been ""unemotional,"" I guess, and I have always been very emotionally open and communicative. This has always been somewhat of a struggle for us, as I like to talk openly about issues in the relationship. He grew up in a very strict household with a mom that was very critical of him no matter how he did at school, his sports teams, etc., and I think his emotional repression now is partly a result of that.

He never, EVER talks about his emotions. One time he got all the way to the final interview for what he once said was his dream job, then got rejected. When I got the text from him I sent him messages trying to comfort him, telling him if they didn't want him they weren't a good company, etc., and made him his favorite dinner so I could cheer him up when he came home. He texts back, ""lol it's fine stop making it such a big deal,"" which kind of hurt, then came home, said he wasn't hungry, and holed up in the bedroom for the whole weekend, so I knew he was actually upset. Another time, his sister was involved in a pretty serious car accident and was hospitalized for a few days. We were sitting at home after hearing about it and I put my hand on his shoulder and asked him if he was okay. He brushed my hand off and said, ""Wtf are you talking about? She's fine. You're making it sound like she's dying."" It makes me reluctant/scared to provide care or be affectionate because I know a lot of times he'll just brush me off and act like I'm a nuisance.

Just in general, he never talks about his feelings. This also makes me feel crazy sometimes when I get upset about something, like when I was passed over for a promotion at work, and talked to him about it, he just said, ""It's just a job, you're not gonna die.""

For a long time I accepted this because I knew it kinda was a result of his upbringing, but recently it really upsets me. For example, recently I can feel he's upset for one reason or another about his new job but I have no idea why (maybe he's not doing well, bad boss) because he will not talk to me about it. I've asked him a few times, everything from ""how's the new job?"" to ""how's your boss?"" ""is it better than your old job?"" but he'll just shrug and say everything's okay.  He also denies the need for therapy, saying this is ""just how he is,"" and a part of me feels like he's proud of his ""lack"" of emotions, because early on in the relationship he once bragged about how he hasn't cried since he was like 5 years old.

A few days ago ago I tried to press him on why he was upset about work, and he blew up at me, and said, ""I'm not like you, just fucking leave me alone.""

**TL;DR:** Boyfriend pretty much never tells me anything about his feelings, and sometimes even seems to take pride in not being ""emotional."" AITA for trying to get him to open up when it's clearly not what he wants? I thought I was helping at first, but now I'm not sure."
"WIBTA Roommate's vibrator left in our shared shower | Would I be the asshole for telling my roommate to be more discreet with her vibrator. Two days ago I woke up to her telling me she just had the best shower then I go to use the bathroom later and her vibrator is just sitting on the floor of the bottom of the shower. I was a little grossed out but I was like okay maybe she forgot and then just waited for her to notice and it was still there this morning. I refused to take a shower those two days till she moves it, like I don't wanna touch that thing. But she just got out of the shower just now and I went to check and ITS STILL THERE just in a different spot! Now it's on the soap bar thing. Like I know everyone masterbates and good for her I don't care but at least have some decency to not put your vibrator where I usually put my soap bar? Is it just me or is that gross? I don't know where to go from here, she's my friend but we don't talk about this stuff and I don't wanna seem like a dick.

edit: i ended up telling her she left her personal item in the shower, she apologized and went and moved it, its all good now"
"WIBTA if I complained about my MIL bringing a second wedding cake. | I recently got married and had a fall theme. For my wedding I made our cake myself. It was a basically a pumpkin bread flavored cake in the shape of a 3D pumpkin. I was pretty proud of it and from the scraps it tasted really good.

A couple days before the wedding my mother-in-law mentioned that her daughters (15 and 10) made a cake ""because she wanted to do something for the wedding. And it looks really good."" I suppose this part's on me because I just think she's saying they made a cake for an after party or something. 

Wedding day comes, I walk into the reception with the cake I made and I see another cake. It's a small-ish cake with white frosting and over decorated with purple frosting. Like it made me think they got some piping bag with a couple different shaped tips and went to town all over the place.

I didn't say anything and still haven't, but I was really mad about it. I later heard from someone else that the real reason they made the cake was because ""not everyone likes pumpkin.""

It's definitely been a couple weeks since the wedding but I'm still steaming about it and I want to say something. Would I be the asshole?

Edit: I should note that at the time we were planning on having an after party since the venue didn't allow alcohol."
"AITA for blowing up at my stepsister at her comments about my lost weight? | My stepsister (20F) and I (24M) have never gotten along. Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say.

When I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was ""cooler"" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like ""fatass"" and ""chubster"". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).

By the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, ""He's still pretty big"", ""Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness"", ""Maybe lose a little more around that gut"". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.

Now here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, ""Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?"" I flipped out. I yelled, ""Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?""She said back to me, ""Defensive much?""  
""Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?"" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. ""Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!"" She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, ""Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!""  
""But you're way older!"" she whined.

I left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to.

AITA?

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for your comments and the awards. I've never felt better about myself than now. And yes, I understand that 270 lbs was not ""bordering"" on obese. I'm 6'0 so I was pretty damn obese. I called myself bordering for a few years after getting fat, it made me feel better than classifying myself as morbidly obese."
"AITA for sending an unhealthy internet date to Whole Foods to pick up the book he loaned me? | I went on a lunch date with a guy I met online.  He weighed at least 80 pounds more than his pictures and his personality didn’t make up for it in the least.  His eating habits also disgusted me.  I was friendly, so I guess he thought I liked him, but I just didn’t want to hurt his feelings and embarrass him in public by leaving the date early .  We had talked about a certain book before the date and he brought his copy to loan to me.  I turned him down, knowing I didn’t want to see him again, but he kept insisting - was quite pushy about it actually - so I took the book.  

Later, I sent him a gentle ‘I’m not interested’ text and he flipped out, calling me superficial, entitle bitch, etc.  He also demanded I meet up with him to give him his book back. This did not sound pleasant.  I did want him to get his book back, but did NOT want to be around him again, especially now that this giant man was angry with me.  I was running errands and he kept texting me.  The book was in my car, and we were in the same general area, which happened to be near a Whole Foods.  I decided to turn his book in to WF customer service.  I told the lady I found it in the store, and she took it without question.  I left and sent a text to they guy telling him where he could pick up his book.  At this, he really flipped his shit, and according to him, I am the worlds biggest asshole.  I had remained civil throughout our communications, but I had enough and my last text advised him to pick up some healthy groceries and stop drowning himself in mayonnaise.  So, AITA?


Edited to add - one commenter said my asshole status regarding the mayonnaise insult depends on its relevance to the date.  The eating habits I was disgusted by: he ate more mayonnaise than I have ever seen a human consume. Ordered extra sides of mayo, twice.  Easily ingested a full cup, not including the ounce or so he coughed onto his plate when his mouth was full.  He kept eating off said plate."
"AITA for being annoyed that my friend planned her daughter’s birthday party on my son’s actual birthday? | So, a little backstory: my son’s birthday is today. My friend’s daughter’s birthday was almost a month ago, in May. My friend also has a step-daughter whose birthday IS today, however, the birthday party is not for her. The birthday party is for a kid whose birthday was in the middle of May. 
We (husband and I) opted to have our son’s birthday party (with friends) next weekend because there’s an annual festival that’s here this weekend, but we are having family over this weekend. My friend knew this, but still wanted to have her daughter’s birthday party from 1-4 today, and stressed that her daughter really wants my son to come. She hasn’t had any plans (over the past few weekends) but still opted to wait almost a month to have her daughter’s birthday party.  Also, although she usually doesn’t take her kids to the festival, she knows I ALWAYS take mine and she knows we’re having family over today. So now, on top of having to do the “guests are coming” clean up of my house, pick up a cake and fruit trays, go to the festival, and then have family over for 3 o’clock,  we have to squeeze in a birthday party for a kid whose birthday party was a month ago. I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed. 
So, AITA for being annoyed that my friend chose THIS day to have her daughter’s birthday party when her daughter’s birthday was a month ago? (I haven’t said anything to her about it, and probably won’t unless she asks)"
"AITA for not making our 7yo do homework | My wife is Finnish and she’s a pediatrician. Growing up, she didn’t have homework. That’s just not how they do things over there, to my understanding. 


Our kids are 7 and 5. The 5yo doesn’t have homework but the 7yo does and honestly, it seems like a lot. 


My wife is firm on the stance that he does not HAVE to do the homework. We make him read nightly(which is part of the homework) and we make him do big projects but that worksheet stuff? Nope. 



She doesn’t agree with giving kids his age homework and tells our kids to tell the teacher we were too busy if she gives him trouble. So far, it hasn’t even been mentioned that he doesn’t do it and he has good grades. 


But a part of me gets a little anxious every Friday afternoon because i think he’ll come home with a nasty note from his teacher about his lack of homework for the week. 



He doesn’t seem to have any anxiety about it nor does my wife obviously. So I’m not sure if it’s unfounded anxiety or not. 



We’ve talked about it and she told him he’ll have to start doing it when he’s in 4th or 5th grade but right now we don’t think it’s appropriate. 



I feel like his teacher secretly thinks we are assholes though. What do you say, reddit?"
"WIBTA If I was to report a close friend for disability fraud? | I have a very close friend that has been a friend to the family for many years.  I was the best man at his wedding and our kids have grown together.  We are now in our 40's.  He used to be in the Air Force but was medically discharged for back issues.  I believe he was at 80% disability.  He currently works full time as a GS employee and makes great money between that and his Air Force pay. He recently sat down with me and said he wanted my help to find a better, nicer home for him as he was successfully able to get 100% disability and will no longer have to pay taxes on his property and where we are located, that's a significant amount.  Well, my friend and I are avid golfers. We play full 18 every couple of days and some days we walk the course. We hit the beach, fish, laser tag and work on his truck.  Just about anything normal guy friends do with family. Never does he complain of pain or show it in any way.  Yet he has also told me he likes to play the sick role when he gets to the Dr. Office and he did that a lot recently when he was trying to get 100%. 

I guess I feel like the a-hole because of how bothered I am to watch him spend all this money that he has only due to the disability claim. Two new cars, Las Vegas trips, new golf sets (3 of them) totaling about 4k all in this last year and it's only happening because of him claiming his disability and it's just sickening to watch.  I want to be a friend but also don't enjoy this fraud aspect."
"AITA for calling a tow truck on my neighbour? | Just as the title says, I called a tow truck on my neighbour for parking in my my spot, here’s the situation.

My girlfriend (who’s expecting) and I live in what are called here ‘side-by-sides’ - four small houses all connected.  I’ve been here over six years. 

Each house has enough space in the back for a vehicle, also there is parking on the street in front.  When I first moved in, the family that was living next door was parking in our space and refused to find someplace else when asked by myself or my houses owner - we rent the house.

So we got a contract with a towing company paid by the landlord along with a big bright shiny reflective sign that very politely asks you not to park there or you will be towed by the towing company  - and it worked like magic!  I had to threaten to call on my neighbours friend who was trying to park there only once- and once I had a total strangers car towed because it was there all day.  

We have new neighbours now,  and these ones just moved in two days ago, (we also had a great family in that unit for the past 2-3years after the first ones left)...  we haven’t even said hello to each other...  So imagine my surprise when I look out my window at 11:30pm and find a giant plumbing van with logos all over parked at a 45degree angle in our parking spot.  

Nobody asked us, we were home and available all day.  I knocked on their door and rang the doorbell, I heard their dog barking, but no one came to the door.  So I made the call- while I felt like an asshole (new neighbour/work vehicle) - I actually don’t... it’s not your spot, you didn’t have a conversation with us and there’s a giant sign saying you will be towed.  




Short story -  we have an official official ‘no parking’ sign in our residential back parking space warning you that you WILL be towed for parking there-  I phoned in on someone parked there."
"AITA for putting the cat my girlfriend brought home up for adoption? | My girlfriend is a veterinarian assistant, studying to be a vet. As a result, she loves animals. We have three cats and two dogs, that I joke she probably loves more than me. I also love these animals, keep that in mind, and I agreed to three of the five. The first cat we got was unexpected when I was out of town, abandoned at the clinic she works at, filthy and in need of a home. She fell in love and couldn’t let her go. I couldn’t blame her there. I wouldn’t be able to turn the kitty away in that situation. One of the other cats…she just kind of accepted from a co-worker without talking with me. It wasn’t an emergency situation or anything. The co-worker was moving out of the country and my girlfriend was the first person she asked.

All of that being said, I’m pretty much done animal wise. My girlfriend occasionally tags me in those “Haha, one day you’ll come home and there’ll be 10000 dogs” posts on Facebook, and sometimes I worry she’s not joking. Then a few months ago, she started talking about another cat, because they got another abandoned one who is pregnant. They found a home for the mama once she gives birth and is through nursing…but the kittens need homes. I told her no and said that she was great at finding homes for animals (true), she’ll find one.

Tonight…she brings home a kitten. I was pissed. I told her that we can’t do this, we have 5 animals and even though we could afford a 6th, taking care of another will be exhausting. She tried guilting me with this kitten and I told her that we could keep him until he found a home, but then he was leaving. She thought I was kidding, but I put a post on Facebook saying “Hey, looking for a safe home for a kitten. Looking for applications.” 

Now, she’s not speaking to me and is calling me an ass. I’m pretty sure I’m not, but am I?"
"AITA for always requesting the front seat? | For context, I'm 6'3"" (190.5 cm) and I'm pretty sure no one else in our friend group is above 6'0"" (182.88 cm), if that. It can be really uncomfortable to sit in the back seat when there's five of us in the car, so I try to get the front seat when I can, knowing the back seat isn't really inconveniencing anyone given their heights. I actually don't even ask every time, just try and naturally drift over to it if I can. I just feel like a jerk for taking it constantly, since ideally we all rotate fairly. I know I'm not a *raging* asshole even if I am in the wrong, but I'm still concerned about screwing the guys over in our seat rotations. Am I the asshole?"
"AITA for not cooking vegetarian food for my daughter? | I have three kids, and my oldest daughter is 6 years old and in first grade. A few weeks ago we were watching an animal documentary on TV and she got really upset by a scene where a lion killed and ate a gazelle. She said she doesn’t want to “eat animals” and has been throwing tantrums every time I make lunch or dinner. I’m assuming this is just a phase she’ll grow out of, but right now it’s really testing my patience. 

Last night, I made baked chicken, green beans, and mashed potatoes. As usual, my daughter threw a fit over the chicken and refused to eat it. This went on for about fifteen minutes. Eventually, she got hungry and ate a few bites but sulked about it the whole time.  

My husband and I have agreed that when our daughter is old enough to prepare her own food and can learn to manage her nutrition adequately, she can make the choice not to eat meat anymore. But right now I handle all the cooking and I have two other kids and my husband to cook for too. What I make is what’s on the menu. AITA?"
"AITA For Not Believing In The Wage Gap in My Work Place? | I'm M23 and work in tech sales, I work with a team of 5 other people 2 other guys and 3 young women. We all got hired about 1 year ago and our numbers are always gauged against each other. I'm consistently the top performer, because I just put a savage amount of hours in and have no work life balance. The rest of the guys vary in the listing but are usually in the top 3 with one or two girls sometimes in the mix at the end of each month. Now since I'm the top performer and a large part of our compensation is based on commission I have been making more than all of them every month and most months the guys make more than the girls in commish. We recently had a meeting with our sales manager and the young women chimed in that theres a gender wage gap in our team/office because the men are always making more and sometimes a lot more. He tried to explain that it was because of commission and that we're all on the same base salary, which they know. But they were kinda ranting about how they should be given a larger % of the commissions they make so that when they do make a ""sale"" it would more or equal us and that would be fair as it would lessen the wage gap. Our sales manager let out a huge sigh and excused himself from the room. A few seconds of awkwardness ensued and I faked like I had a call coming through and got the fuck out of there since it was a friday and I just ran out of the building and ran home. 

 I met up with a friend for dinner later on friday and told her about this scenario telling her how it was crazy to me because there is no wage gap, I just make more ""sales"" so I make more money thats how it works. She said that I'm an ass for not listening to their concerns and to her (She has her masters in HR) it does sound like a gender pay gap and the young womens compromise seemed fair. I just laughed and she called me an ass again.....

AITA?"
"AITA I blocked a friend because he asked for my help | So a bit of backstory, I knew this guy from college, I was on a two year course and he was only there for the first year. He dropped out and, as I understand it, is now pursuing a career in music.

The reason I mention his career is because that was what he wanted help with, he messaged me after not being in contact for close to two years he messages saying he wants to use some prop guns I have. I know through mutual friends that he is into drugs (mainly weed) and I know through personal experience that he isn't very responsible.

Now these guns are a mix of black airsoft and deactivated revolvers that I got when my grandad passed away, and wouldnt be legal to take outside (I live in the UK). 

When he asked me I was so annoyed that I completely ignored his first message. He then messaged me again asking the same thing to which my response was to block him on all social medias.

Edit 1. Many people are commenting on how I should have said no, simply for the legal issue. A tad mor context for this, the course we were on was a public services course (mainly for police), and I would have thought it was common knowledge for anyone within the UK, especially if they are attempting to use them as props, that it us not legal to just walk around with weapons that could be mistaken as real."
"AITA for thinking my girlfriend is being unreasonable for not wanting me to have people over ever? | Hi Reddit!

at an impasse with my girlfriend after a pretty heated discussion. would like to know your thoughts!

I am a professional musician, I live from my music. It’s electronic. I don’t make a ton of money, but enough that I don’t have to have a job and can have a bit of cash to spend here and there on fun stuff like music equipment etc. I met my girlfriend because she was a fan of my music and we really hit it off. 

We’ve been living together for a few years now and she is quite an introverted person. I’m perfectly fine with this, I also like my own space, but she is much more introverted than me. She doesn’t really have any friends in our city, and isn’t interested in making any either. 

Occasionally I’ll have people over from existing collaborations to work on music or rehearse for performances etc. this is all fine with her. We don’t have trouble with the neighbors as they also play music loud.

The issue comes up when I want to have other people over. A few months ago a friend named John was visiting and he asked for a place to crash for one night. I offered our couch as he had previously let me stay on his. She was upset that I didn’t include her in the decision, and didn’t want him there. It was a pretty big fight. 

I thought it was fair to want to be included, but I also thought it was just a bit unreasonable. John had stayed with us once before, she knows him, and it was only for one night. He ended up staying and it was totally fine.

So anyway, this morning I’m chatting with my friend Fred who is coming to visit and he mentions wanting to jam in my studio. He wouldn’t stay over, he just wants to come over one day and work on stuff. We had done a track by sending files to each other and it came out great so I was like yeah cool! No concrete plan or anything but I was just excited.

I tell her oh yeah I’m gonna jam with Fred and she immediately starts telling me I can’t decide these things without her and I can’t have him over. I was just flabbergasted and got pretty angry and we had an argument.

I understand wanting to discuss things, but I hadn’t even made a concrete plan and she immediately jumped into denying my jam with my friend.

To me it’s like come on, I’m a musician for a living, you know me because of my music. Part of being in music means collaborating with other people and hosting friends and engaging in the community. 

I think it’s totally unreasonable to just shut everyone out and say I can’t have anyone over like that.

So AITA?"
"AITA for not letting my brother go trick or treating? | My brother is 12, and he wants to go trick or treating with his friends tonight.

Here's the issues:

1. he will be the oldest there - the other 2 kids he'll be going with are also 12 years old, and they're all idiots. I've seen these kids run into the middle of a busy street on a dare. There will be no parental supervision.
2. he has a phone but rarely uses or checks it - I've talked with him about this before and he says it's not his fault he never remembers to check it and as he doesn't like talking on the phone he outright ignores any phone calls
3. they plan to meet up at 6pm and wrap things up for around 8pm - they live in the neighbouring town, a 20 minute bus ride away, and my car is at the garage, so we're public transport reliant right now, and after 6pm busses are hourly.

I've said he can't go because of the lack of supervision and his dislike of checking in, plus the logistics with the bus. He says I'm being unreasonable, I need to trust that he will check in, I can get him a taxi if it comes to that, and as he's nearly a teenager I should be treating him like one.

AITA?

Info: I am my brother's sole legal guardian.

He has never been trick or treating before.

I don't get off work until 7, so I'm not available to supervise from 6. I've said that the options are find someone over 12 to supervise or send me texts to check in (even just one saying he got there fine and another saying he's on the bus back) but he says he won't remember.

Update: He went anyway. He missed the 8:25 bus, the 9:25 didn't arrive, and I had to go in a taxi to get him."
"AITA: for not telling a girls husband she cheated on him with my ex? She’s pregnant | There was a girl I used to work with called C.
She was a young married Christian woman who I didn’t really like or dislike at the time. 
I started to notice my bf had really weird messages, not incredibly guilty ones, just the “you want me to bring food over” “when can we next hang out” sort of thing. I asked him if anything had happened between them, I had spent the past 3 months over seas with family. He denied it and life moved on.

Well we broke up, not for any particular reason and low and behold, 7 months later I get a message from C saying that something did happen between them when I was away , and pretty much asked me for advice on him because she couldn’t stop thinking about him and felt she was in love. 

I was obviously hurt. I messaged him who finally admitted it and played the “she blackmailed me and I didn’t want to lose you” card. Whatever, you’re not my bf now go fuck your self. 
However I did message her, and try my best to sort her emotions out as best as I could. I advised that she tell her husband, but that was about as far as my meddling went.

It’s now a two months later, and she’s just announced she’s pregnant. I feel really lost on how I feel. Good for her moving on and starting a family. But I can’t help but feel her husband should know of her infidelity. Would telling him shatter their lives for no reason? Or would it give him the opportunity to make a choice on a marriage that hasn’t been honest with him?
I don’t  think it’s my ex’s baby if that makes a difference, the dates don’t add up for that. 

TLDR: married woman cheated with my ex boyfriend. Do I tell her husband even though the couple are now pregnant?"
"AITA if I suggest selling my engagement ring that I never wear? | I have been married to a wonderful man for over a decade. When we first started discussing marriage, I said up front I am not into jewelry and not to spend a lot on an engagement ring. I really only saw myself ever wearing a simple wedding band and a big rock on my finger just wasn't me. But for whatever reason, he still went for a nice ring with a beautiful, quality diamond. It is a beautiful ring, but I only wore it for the 6 months we were engaged, and then when we got married I only wore my wedding band after that. I just find it more practical, it doesn't have a diamond sticking up that can catch on things, and it is a less flashy ring, and just more ""me"" style-wise. I maybe pull my engagement ring out of the safe once a year if we go somewhere nice and get dressed up and even then it is only because my husband suggests I wear it.

Now this ring was given with love but I truly feel more sentimental about my wedding ring than the engagement ring. WIBTA if I suggested to my husband that this engagement ring (probably worth at least 5K) is wasted sitting in a safe 99% of the time and we could sell it and put the money towards something else (mortgage, car loan, family vacation, etc.)? We are not struggling financially, but I we are also pretty practical people who don't spend wastefully either. This ring might have been the biggest exception to that.

EDIT: A few of you have assumed some things that aren't true. So to clarify.

1. the value of the ring is not 5k. 5k is what we could probably get for selling it (well the diamond, really). The original price was way more.

2. The ring was bought on credit with a down payment by my husband, and I paid MORE than half of the ring off at the time when we combined finances.

3. The ring is not symbolic to my husband. He didnt want to look like a cheapskate (and wasnt sure I really meant it when I said to buy something cheap) so he spent way more than he should have. He is not upset that I never wear it. He never wears his ring either. He knows the wedding ring is the meaningful one to me. For our anniversary he had our kids birthstones set into it because I wear that one every day."
"AITA for asking my girlfriend to change her sweatpants if she wanted to have a date with me ? | So today my girlfriend and I were going to have dinner together (I'm paying) and I went to pick her up from the hospital were she was visiting his brother (new father). I asked her if she wanted to change before we go and she 
Refused because she was not going to change for a dinner that will last for 2 hours. So I insisted because I was nicely dressed and put some effort before going out, she got pissed but agreed and we drove to her place. Right now I'm downstairs waiting for her and I think I may have ruined the date but it made me feel like she didn't think a dinner with me is important enough for her to look dress nicely. 
She knew before hand we were going out, it's not fancy but still I don't like to feel like I'm not worth the effort to look pretty.

Edit to add more context

Edit 1: We went to a sushi bar. 
Edit 2: She cares about how I dress to. 

Update:  She took 45 min to get ready ( I had it coming), but the wait was worth it she was beautiful and pissed. I thank her for changing her clothes and explained how I felt, she understood and after 5 min of silence in the car everything was normal. The dinner was good, she doesn't like when I check my phone on the table so I gave it to her (hence the lack of response). I love her very much and we have been together for 8 years we love each other very much. For what is worth writing my emotions here made me realize that I had to explain myself better and so I did."
"AITA For Faking An Australian Accent With My Good Friend For 2 Years? | So I visited my homie that I knew forever at his college and he introduced me to his roommate. We thought it'd be funny if I pretended to be from Australia the whole weekend I was there, since I have a good accent, and we'd be hanging out with his roommate that weekend as well. Everything was good and we had a good time and my friend and I were laughing the whole time and he didnt know why. Fast forward to the next semester he transferred to my college and text me saying we should hang out. He's a super dope dude so when I went to meet him at starbucks he had like 5 other people there, and he introduced me as his australian friend, keep in mind that whole weekend we made a whole backstory for me. Well I thought it'd be SUPER awkward to tell him I was pretending in front of all his friends so I kept it going. Luckily I hadnt seen the people he was with since but fast forward 1.5 years me and the guy are still friends and hang out semi-regularly, and every time I have to make sure none of my other friends are with us so i can do the accent and i feel so bad about this whole situation that started as a joke"
"AITA for being mad that my sister goes to a private school? | For context: My sister is in grade 3, while I am in high school.

So basically, my sister, was falling quite far behind in her school work. My parents thought it was the teachers as she (apparently) has dyslexia (never been officially diagnosed but she shows alot of signs, so understandable). After doing alot of school searching and hopping, my parents were somewhat angry that no school they desired would take her (they obviously went after ones with high reviews, however the only ones with placements left were more...undesirable), so they put her into a private school, costing around 600$ per month, in the hopes that she gets more 1-on-1 time and help with her work, due to overall lesser amount of classmates and the like. I was obviously annoyed by this, but their defense was that I have never struggled with grades (Which is true) and never needed any help with work. This wasn't helped by the fact that they changed after 2 weeks at the new private school, and chose an even more expensive private school afterwards, which is almost double, at around 1200$ a month. While I understand that she needs more help than I do, I can't help but feel tossed to the side as my sister gets this special education I wasn't allowed. I still think I would benefit If I went to private school at this stage, but of course my parents deny it, claiming that my grades are good enough that it wouldn't benefit me. (And it's not a money problem; my parents earn quite alot and could easily afford for me to go aswell). I admit (maybe selfishly) would love to be able to put on my resume/CV that I went to a private school; and I am sure I WOULD indeed benefit grades wise if I went.

So, AITA?"
"AITA for telling a complete stranger that her husband cheated on her? | I have a GF who wants to be serious with me but I felt some things were off - she claimed she had gone to a particular University but when I googled it said she had gone to a shittier one. No big deal, but I don't like liars. I confronted her (we are temporarily apart over Xmas) and said 'Um, so some things have been bothering me'.

Anyway she said 'no I also have a degree from the better uni, but the 2nd degree is more relevant for my career'.

Ok fine.

She also previously told me she had passed a test for some kind of government job-for-life but online it said she had actually failed it.

So she tells me 'no, they changed the scores after I sat the test'.

Eh this isn't impossible this is a corrupt developing country, not a big deal.

So anyway I said 'some other things you have said to me seem to be off, maybe this is true, but I think you lied about them too - you told me you didn't have a relationship with this dude, but on his FB it's clear that you did - I don't care how many exes you had, I just don't need any lies about stuff'.

So she says 'no I will send you my FB and Google account and you can see.'

I'm like 'don't bother'

But she sends it anyway.

She's deleted all of her FB messages so I say 'why did you send me this? if you've deleted all the messages from these dudes it's not proving anything anyway, it just looks worse'.

So I check her Google account and lo it shows that she used Tinder on her phone like an hour before. I send her this and she's like 'My account must have been hacked'.

So I'm like 'Look it's not a big deal if you open Tinder, but I don't need lies about it'

And then I find her sent items and there's her CV attached there and whaddya know she doesn't have the degree she says.

And then I check the linked apps on FB and open Badoo, where I find this set of messages from a dude in Sep 2018:

\> Tonight you will be my completely my woman and I will see if you are good woman in the bed baby !!!

\>> and what time you arrive at hotel

\>Around 9:30 or 10:30 baby ,, but I will stay in other room baby because before sleep I need speak with her and my son ,, after that I will go with you and sleep together and tomorrow morning around 10 or 11 I will come back to my room for speak with her again and then I will come back with you for say bye before you come back my love ok !!

and then from her later

\> baby don't to late give me your number whatsapp for me. because my badoo sometimes is broken and need inside by email. so i'm afraid if suddenly i lost my badoo

\> i'm promise will be behave in whatsapp, not chat you first if you not chat me

Anyway I looked him up on FB and whaddya know he is newly married last year, pregnant at the time, baby born this year.

So I just sent a link to his Badoo profile to his wife.

Anyway, AITA for contacting this random on FB who has a young baby to let her know her husband is a cheat?"
"WIBTA if I sent someone back their Christmas card and asked them not to send them to me anymore. | A little background. I met a guy (‘Mark’) at work many years ago and we developed a pretty close friendship. I often met up with him and his wife for dinners, movies, etc. and we frequently went to each other’s houses to hang out.

I am a gay man and fairly late in life I came out to my family and friends a little over four years ago. I came out to Mark at one of our dinner meet ups and he seemed cool with it and accepting. However, after that day, he never once tried to contact me to do anything social and all attempts to meet up had to be initiated by me. He often had excuses about being busy and the couple times we did get together, something just seemed off.  I eventually stopped trying and we haven’t spoken in over three years now. Over the course of my life I have come to understand that most friendships are transient in nature but this one got to me. It can’t be a coincidence that this happened right after I came out to him but I didn’t want to be confrontational about it so I just accepted it and moved on.

However, every year I get a Christmas card from him and his wife. It is the typical recent picture of them printed on a card with a Christmas greeting. Nothing personal is ever written on it. I just received the latest one and I realized that receiving the card makes me sad rather than happy and serves as an annual reminder of the loss of our friendship.  I would really rather not get them.  After Christmas is over this year, I really want to send the card back to him with a note saying I prefer not to receive any cards from him in the future.  WIBTA?  I’d really like to get an outside perspective on this.

Edit: Hey everyone, I appreciate all the feedback.  I can see now that I was making way too big a deal of this in my head.  In the future I will just throw the cards away like any other mail I don't want to receive. Thanks again for your perspectives."
"AITA for not telling my friend about her daughter’s barf fest? | My 18 year old daughter is BFFs with my friend’s 17 year old daughter. 

Friend’s family own a cottage. There is much drinking. She bought her kid alcohol. (Drinking age is 19, pot is legal). Her kid got wasted and smokes up while we were both sleeping. I got woken up by the kids at 2am to let me know HER daughter was vomiting (in the bedroom, kitchen sink, and bathroom floor and toilet). I cleaned her puke, held her hair out of her face and made sure she didn’t puke and choke while she slept. Carpet (ugly throw rug) was a complete write off. 

Additional info:  I parent very differently from her. I am approachable. Tend to be no judgemental in the moment, and make expectations clear. Kids tell me shit. She, on the other hand, parents very differently. She is very punitive, yells a lot, and tends to be very reactive.   She is jealous of my relationships with  her kids and other kids. 

I did have a conversation with her kid about safe limits and harm reduction. 

Now she is pissed that I didn’t tell her about the incident, and is driving home from the cottage a day early to “punish” her daughter. 

AITA for not telling her??  Cause she is mad crazy pissed.

Update:  now mom of other kid is telling me her daughter is not allowed to text me or be in contact with me or my kid. FYI she pays her own phone bill."
"AITA For being annoyed at her child | Ok so Ive have been talking to a girl on tinder for a few days and she likes to speak on FaceTime, no issues with that we get on very well and I enjoy talking to her, the only problem is her kid is teething at the moment and he is screaming in pain, she’s a good parent and tries to comfort him and help him but she still wants me to stay on FaceTime.

I don’t get a lot of time to myself after work so I try to watch tv to unwind but as soon as I mention I’m home to her she is already FaceTime calling me.

I don’t mind her child he seems lovely and is obviously having a rough time teething, I like talking to her but the FaceTime calls really getting to me because whenever she calls me at the moment her child is screaming in the background so we aren’t actually talking, I just end up listening to her comfort her baby while I have to stare at my paused Netflix because I can’t hear the tv.. 

I’ve just hung up on her without explanation because the sound of her screaming child is ringing around my head. AITA?

Edit: ok a little bit more info because I can see I haven’t given enough information, so I don’t mind kids crying I get it that kids cry, I know that she’s a parent first, but my problem is why do we need to FaceTime while her child is so upset, We’re not actually communicating I’m just watching her comfort her child, We aren’t progressing to anything by doing this... 

I do need to work on my communication but I feel that if I say anything remotely negative about her being a mother it’s going to ruin things"
"AITA for buying going on holiday whilst my gf was recovering from an accident? | My girlfriend was hit by a drunk driver 2 months ago, the paramedics rang me and said she was in critical condition. She had broken one leg, her wrist, fractured her skull, slipped a disc in her back and broken her collar bone + 3 ribs. She was in a bad way but recovered well. She spent 4 weeks in hospital and then was released with the use of a wheelchair until her leg and back were fixed. 

We had a holiday to Amsterdam booked for us two and 3 of our friends. My friends said they understood I wouldn't be able to make it but the flights were non-refundable. My gf was kept on morphine so was sleeping a lot. I asked if she'd mind me going and she wasn't really with it but said it's fine cause she wouldn't be much fun. 

Last week, I went for a week to Amsterdam as planned and my GFs sister took care of her. 

My GF sister sent me a message when I was away saying she couldn't believe I'd gone and that of course my GF would say it's okay, she is doped up and would feel guilty telling me to stay but that I should've stayed anyway. 

I returned yesterday and my GF sister and my Mum and Brother think I was an asshole. My GF hasn't really spoken about it other than to say she missed me. 

AITA?

**TL;DR** my gf was in a car accident, whilst she was recovering I went on holiday with friends."
"AITA for not paying the babysitter? | Our child is 2. A friend's child is 3 and nonverbal. Their occupational therapist suggested more social gatherings between children to help him out because he's very far behind on speech and play. We live in a very rural-ish area so there's nothing like community centres or classes or whatever she could take.

I suggested we have extended playdates. She brings her child to our house, let them socialize and play, because it benefits our kid too, and while that's going on I can get a break from the constant monitoring and do chores. My friend implored me to leave the house if I need to, she's got it all under control, so I have been leaving to do errands sometimes, maybe gone 20-30min out of our 3-4hr playdates.

It went on for two weeks when she dropped a bombshell on my husband and I: ""so when are you guys gonna pay me?"". She thinks we hired her as babysitter when the intention was this to be beneficial to her child. I'm not going to pay a babysitter when 80% of the time I'm right there in the same room. She and her child eats our food, uses our Netflix, etc. Nevermind the fact the \_primary purpose of this arrangement is to help her kid\_.

If there's any exchange of money I'd say we deserve it for the service we're providing--but I won't, because I'm not an asshole. She is, though, right?"
"AITA for boarding a flight that my travel buddy got bumped from? | 
We both just checked in at the airport and I was given a seat but my friend was bumped and is now flying standby. I’m about to board the flight (we are currently traveling around Europe and our flight back home is tomorrow) and he has options to rent a car or take a bus to get to where we’re going. 

Am I the asshole for leaving him behind?

Edit: my bag is already on the plane and I did not have the option to also standby. They are obviously going to compensate him as necessary.

Edit #2: if i would have volunteered to stay off the flight, they airline would not have compensated me and I would have had to pay for whatever new ticket I bought. However, they did compensate my friend with 250€ and first class tickets on the next flight out. I don’t feel so bad anymore."
"AITA for telling off my dorm mate? | My dorm mate (18F) and I (18F) have been rooming with each other for about two months now. 
We often argue, but are otherwise on good terms. I’m seriously considering a room change now, though. 
Earlier today, I got back on campus from being away for a few days. While I was gone, I got my period. As I was unloading my things from my car, I was leaving everything placed on my bed. (We live on the sixth floor of our building, for context) I was rushing up and down from the elevator, not really caring WHERE I put things, but trying to do it quickly. 
I guess I left a box of pads on my bed, and she got to our room with a guest and saw them. A clean, brand new box of pads. She made a point of letting me know that it was “Disgusting,” and “Ignorant,” to leave pads out to begin with. I explained that I had been rushing, to no avail. She freaked out and basically embarrassed me for nothing, in front of a person I didn’t know. 
When her guest left, I told her that what she did was pretty awful and that it wasn’t fair to me that I get berated for leaving an otherwise normal item on my bed. She retaliated again, so I just plainly cussed her out. She started to cry when I was done. AITA? I know I could’ve put my things away as I brought them up, but I didn’t think my clean laundry, pads, and groceries would warrant a freak out."
"AITA (M27) for being upset that I keep getting woken up at night by fiance (F24) and sisters? | My fiance and I have been dating for five years now and engaged for one. We recently bought a new home about six months ago after dealing with communal living for the previous four. I was under the impression that we'd be moving out together and alone to start our new chapter together, just us. I found out that this was not the case one month before we found a home. My fiance wanted her sister and my sister to move in. I said ""no"" and I was adamant. I was tired of communal living. We argued for a couple days. I did not ""win"" that argument. Next, I said ""ok, we need to charge them a reasonable price for rent. I did not ""win"" that argument. They pay a nominal rent fee. ""Then I have two rules:""

\* Do not park in the two foremost spots in the driveway (note this is a 3-car garage for four people).

\* Doors closed at 12am. I have two dogs that sleep with me and when they hear noises, the go off.

wo weeks ago, my fiance's sister came home at 12:18am- 10 minutes after I had fallen asleep. As my dogs went off, I was awoken with a surge of adrenaline. After realizing what I had happened, I was furious. I had effectively taken a power nap and was no longer tired. I texted my fiance and told her I'd get even. I texted her sister and went off on her for her lack of respect. I contemplated hooking up an alarm to my bluetooth speaker outside her sister's door but elected not to because of the collateral damage.

To be clear, I know my reaction to that situation makes me an asshole, but I'm wondering about the situation as a whole.

The next day, my fiance justified her sister's behavior with ""Well she gets off at work at 9:40pm and still had to go to the gym"". I pleaded my case and how that had no weight with me. She could have left the gym 15 mins early. For the next four days, my fiance and I didn't talk. On the fourth day she came to me and asked why I was upset and ignoring her. I was neither of these things. I felt defeated. I felt like i had been tricked from the start to buying this big ass house under the ruse that I could live comfortably. After talking it out, we ended on a good note. My fiance kind-of supported me but said that if her sister would be coming home late, she would accomadate. I did not like this at all. On day one everyone was good with it but now that it's not convenient to follow the rule, they don't. I shouldn't have to negotiate with a tenant in my home so I can get sleep. I go to sleep at 12am. That is more than fair and reasonable. I did not ""win"" this argument.

&#x200B;

Long story short, my fiance came home last night at 12:18 from the gym and woke me up. The night was uneventful but the next morning I kept leaving the bedroom light on while I got ready just to be petty. I wanted her to feel what it felt like.

&#x200B;

I know I didn't handle either circumstances well but as a whole, I need some perspective. I'm open to advice, or being told flat-out, I'm the asshole."
"AITA for bringing up the fact that my sister is African American? | Edit: thank you for everyone that responded. I especially appreciate those that explained what I could do better in the situation. I wasn't ""trying to be cool"" or anything like that. She's my sister, that's just a fact to me. I was trying to provide context for what I thought was a funny coincidence, but I did it in the wrong way. I'll do my best to improve in the future.

(Also, for those that asked, I was not sober during this experience. That may have played a part in my idiocy.)


For context, I am a white guy. My family is all white except for my youngest sister, who is adopted and African American. 

Last weekend, I was at my regular bar talking to an African American guy (John). John is another regular that I'd seen around but hadn't talked to until recently. He saw someone else he knew so he started talking to then and I was just waiting at the bar watching some college football.

I was also dancing around a bit while I waited. This is a dive bar, so I'm not doing much, just grooving a little. I'm not a great dancer, I would say actually say I'm pretty bad, but it's fun, ya know?

He comes back and laughs at me a little and says ""man, you dance like such a white guy."" I laugh and say ""yeah, that's kind of funny you say that, my sister is adopted..."" at that point he kind of cuts me off. He says that's not ok to just randomly say, that it shouldn't matter. He was pretty upset about it. 

Eventually I was able to explain that I was going to tell him that my sister tells me that I ""dance like a white guy"" all the time as well. I thought it was a funny thing, but he was pretty cold the rest of the night.

I thought it was a funny coincidence, but a couple people I've talked to said it was inappropriate for me to bring up my sister like that in that context. Was I an asshole for this?"
"AITA for allowing my son and his friend to stay home alone? | I work from home; this is common knowledge among my kids’ friends’ parents. My kids are now 11, 13 and 17. Today, my older two kids were not home, it was just my son and a friend of his. They were playing video games and goofing around. My wife and I trust my son, we do leave him home alone. Not for hours on end because 1) there’s never a need to and 2) that’d be excessive, but we can run to the store or go on a date night while his siblings are out and he’ll be fine. I assumed he’d be fine with his friend while I ran to the grocery store to grab dinner. I told them I was heading out, where I was going and what time I’d be back. Both boys had cell phones. I was back before the friend was picked up. I was gone maybe an hour tops.

However later that night, my wife got a call from the friend’s mom pissed off because her son was left alone without her knowledge. She says I should’ve asked, because she doesn’t allow it. In our state, it’s legal to leave kids alone at that age and he didn’t say he wasn’t allowed, so I figured it’d be okay. My wife gave me the phone when I asked so I could talk. I apologized for not being aware and she said it’s just common courtesy. I said maybe for younger kids. I asked why her son didn’t tell me and she said that he didn’t want to see uncool, which I can see. But then ultimately, she should make me aware. I explained I would’ve asked before letting them leave the house alone together, but I figured they were much safer and my son knows not to answer the doors, etc. She was still quite angry, said she assumed I’d be home all day and said that her son will not be coming back over.

Was I an asshole to leave the boys home alone?"
"AITA for expecting my girlfriend to attend a family wedding while sick with a cold? | My cousin got married last weekend. We were pretty close while growing up, but haven't been very close since I started dating my girlfriend 2 years ago.

On the morning of the wedding, both of us wake up with a cold. Just a run of the mill, congestion and sore throat kind of cold. I get out of bed and take some cold meds and start getting ready, but she refused to get out of bed. I told her this wedding is important to me, but she wouldn't budge.

I ended up leaving without her and went solo. I believe that once in a lifetime family functions are too important to miss, am I wrong to expect her to go to?"
"AITA for refusing to look after my bfs daughter? | My boyfriend has a 4 year old daughter and he has her every other weekend and now he wants more time with her. He wants me to look after her for a couple of hours a week whilst he’s at work (before he gets home) but I don’t want to. 

I don’t dislike her, but I don’t particularly love children and I don’t wanna take care of her alone. He thinks I’m being selfish but I don’t think i am. 

Am I being the asshole here? Should I do this for him?"
"AITA For Dumping My Gf Because She Got Fat? | I'm M22 and my Gf is F21, been together for about a year now. When we met she was fit as fuck and really hot, we'd go to the gym together and I was very attracted to her. After about 4-5 months of dating I noticed she would rarely go to the gym, and she put on a lot of weight. Over the next 6 months same habits of her not eating well and gaining weight happened and she's put on about 60 lbs in the year we've been dating. I am not physically attracted to her anymore because she got fat and is not taking care of herself anymore. I ended things last night with her and just left it at things aren't working out anymore. She was extremely sad and said she knows its because of the weight gain and said she gained weight due to stress from school. I just didn't like this version of herself where she was unhealthy and not taking care of herself so i still wanted to end it. 

This morning I get a bunch of texts and calls from her sister calling me a huge asshole, douche, etc

AITA?"
"AITA for unfriending a longtime friend without warning for questioning the moon landing? | A few weeks back, around the anniversary of the moon landing, a friend was questioning on Facebook that he has reservations about the film footage of the moon landing.  I, and others, asked if he was serious. I did not suspect any elaborate satire, and his SO made a rolling eye emoji as a comment.

After mulling it over, I decided it was just not worth it providing Google searches supporting the moon landing (he's a grown ass man) and unfriended him and his SO, who was collateral damage to avoid awkwardness.

Today, he messaged me, saying he valued our friendship and was sorry he caused offense, but didn't know why. I told him the reason why, told him I did not suspect it was satire, but let me know if I was wrong.  He hasn't responded yet.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: he just responded.

*To explain, it is somewhat satirical. When I took my Media and Communications course in my first year of my degree, we discussed Noam Chomsky and manufactured reality. Our prof posed the question: did the moon landing really exist—outside of what we have seen only in a photograph or video, can we actually verify this event occurred or are we simply following suit with the blind mindset of society, a manufactured reality. In the end, I couldn't answer the question with a definite ""yes, the moon landing occurred"". I am no flat earther by any means. And sure, I believe it is possible that the moon landing happened, I cannot say for sure that it did, especially with all the propaganda that emanated from the United States over the last century. My comments were an attempt to look at things outside of the photograph and video. I wasn't there when it happened. I wasn't even alive. But it has made me question everything I ever learned as a child. Residential schools, for example. We never learned anything about First Nations affairs in school, other than ""the Indians"" existed. I thought residential schools were special boarding schools. Nope. 
At any rate, I am so sorry my comments were so alarmist.*

I then asked him then if I was the only one who reacted negatively."
"AITA for getting mad at my mom who serves better food to our workers than the one we eat ourselves? | Our house is currently being built. Due to economic and personal problems we had to move out from the apartment we were renting into the construction itself, into a makeshift room where we live until our house is complete. Naturally, there are workers there, constructing from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm Monday to Friday. Since they live really far away they never arrive with any food, so we have to give them breakfast and the main food you give at around 3:00 pm, english isn't my first language so I don't know the name for that particular meal. Anyway, that itself isn't what I get mad about. Hell I'm not some son of a bitch who wouldn't feed them knowing how hard they work. What gets me really mad is how my mom feeds them compared to us. She'll go out of her way to buy them roast chicken, pizza, she'll make them stuff like omelets, fried rice, a lot of good stuff. While us, with the excuse of ""being too busy cooking for them"", end up eating some disgusting ""salads"" consisting of spinach and tomato with not a single drop of dressing, not even salt, some nasty ready-to-eat dishes you just heat in a microwave, some days we won't even eat until nighttime, where we'll have shit like a donut and a glass of milk, or cookies, which wouldn't be bad if we had a good meal before that."
"AITA for telling my girlfriend, now wife, that she cheated on me with her bestfriend/our roommate | About two to three years ago my girlfriend, now wife, went to an outing(it was a day drinking event) with our girl roommate who is a really good friend of my wifes and when they came back later in the night, the girl roommate parked in the garage and her and my wife made out in the roommates car. When my wife came up stairs she told me and I was upset, but then she went straight to bed because she was drunk.

&#x200B;

Anyways, just last night we were talking about relationships and I brought up to my wife that she has cheated on me before and I mentioned the above. After mentioning it to my wife doesn't believe that it is cheating and it was just a drunken make out with two best friends.

&#x200B;

I told her it doesn't matter if its drunken or not or if you guys are best friends it is still cheating on the person you have a relationship with.

&#x200B;

AITA for bringing it up and telling her that she has cheated on me before?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Keep in mind I did bring it up when it happened. I just happened to bring it up again because she didn't at the time think it was cheating. I just thought she would have had a different opionion"
"AITA for telling a stranger he is creepy for following my child home? | About 5mins after my kids came home for school a stranger knocked on my door. I answered the door and the strange informed me he had watched my daughter get off the bus and took note of which house she walked to.  He said he did this because my daughter was ""flipping him off"" from the back of the bus as he drove behind.

I thanked him for letting me know but I told him that I thought it was incredibly creepy that he followed a child home from the bus no matter the reason.  He looked devasted when I told him this. AITA for trying to give him a heads up about being creepy?"
"AITA for giving my sister an ""unfair"" portion of the money I made selling her old bike? | So I recently started selling old stuff on Ebay that we no longer use. So basically old shirts, our old rollerskates, and most recently my sisters old bike. I asked for her permission to sell it and she gave me the greenlight. I sold it for a good 130 euros and gave my sister her portion of thr money. I decided that she would get 35% of the money cause it is her bike, I woukd get 35% because i repaired, cleaned, and sold the bike, and my aunt would get 30% because she originally bought the bike. But now my sister is mad saying she should have gotten 50% cause its her bike. 

AITA?

Edit: Because a few people asked. My sister originally didnt want any money but then after i sold the bike she wanted a share.

Edit2: For people wondering why i gave my aunt money. Both me and my sister lice with our aunt and i thought that because she bought it in the first place she should also get a cut.

Edit3: so based of of judgement i gave my sister enough money to make her share 50% and after i told my aunt she said she didnt want a share anyway and gave me her share. Ive decided that since my aunt doesnt want any money in the future that ill just put a bit of money from my cut on the side whenever i sell something to buy her a birthday present."
"AITA for having this conversation with my GF | I (M20) recently had this conversation with my girlfriend (F20) and want to know if I’m being irrational. 

I was upset when we started talking about her going abroad for a semester and leaving our university. When she asked why I just told her it was because of me being afraid of the unknown, like not being with her, if she will be loyal, and how it will change what we have been doing for about 6 months now. 

I told her that I want her to go and want her to have a good time, but that I won’t just pretend like it’s isn’t scary and doesn’t worry me.

She seemed very upset, especially about that fact that I thought she might get with someone else while she’s gone. I told her that i don’t think she would but it’s still in my head, and if it happen it would seriously mess with me. 

I know that this conversation will blow over and we will have fun before she leaves (4months away), but AITA fort outlook at the situation? I said that I know it’s something we can work on and how i feel isn’t permanent, but at the moment i feel bad about it all. 

AITA?"
"WIBTA if I fasted for extended periods of time despite my wife's history with eating disorders? |  Married for 2 years. My wife has struggled with anorexia in her past and only started getting better after I started cooking for her (when we were still friends). Over the time progress was made, she was back to a healthy weight, started cooking for herself again, and developed healthy eating habits. While she got over her anorexia however I started eating more and more, I wouldn't say it's an eating disorder more unhealthy eating habits. Anyways what prompted me to do something was that I learned that I'm technically obese now (!!!! I used to be so fit wtf happened) so I signed up for a gym and restricted my diet... to literally nothing. I read up on water fasting and decided on going 5 days with no calorie intake, and the weekends off where I'd eat keto. I've done this before I met her so I'm not going in inexperienced. 

&#x200B;

  I brought this up with a friend and he said it would trigger my wife's anorexia and make her relapse into her old habits. I think it's worth mentioning that she occasionally (once every month or two) refuses to eat anything and I have to coax her and tell her she's beautiful etc. I'm worried that if she sees me going on hunger strike she'll feel compelled to do the same and as I lose weight she'll have more reason to relapse. I do think I'm going to go through with it because I do want to lose weight.

&#x200B;

 (As a side note in case you're wondering why I'm going nuclear and jumping into such a restrictive diet, I've tried normal diets before and I can't really stop myself. It's all or nothing.)"
"AITA for being upset because my parents paid for my sister's therapy and not mine? | I'm very aware of how spoiled this sounds, don't worry. I just wanna know if I'm an arsehole. Also, this is an alt/throwaway bc my main is just for my art. 

So I'm a 22 year old lad. I've had mental health issues for as long as I can remember, but things got really really bad for me around 15 or 16. Not to get too into the fine details, but I started suffering full blown psychosis symptoms including hallucinations and it was really really scary. I got myself put into therapy and stuff through the NHS but it didn't work very well for me. The first therapist I got put with wasn't really suited for what I needed, so I stopped seeing him, but then I got put on a waiting list where I was stuck for a month and had the same issue with the second therapist. Because of this, I asked my mum and stepdad if they'd help me pay for private therapy because I might have better luck there. I could pay about half, but I'd need help with the rest. They said no, as they didn't see the difference between private and NHS therapy and said that if I had no success with the latter they weren't paying for me to have no success with the former. It's all culminated in me having a diagnosis and medication that I hate, but no therapist. I'm not proud of myself but a couple of years ago, I began self medicating with narcotics because when I'm high is the only time the worst of the symptoms really go away. I know it's bad and I know I need to stop and I'm trying to be better but I do still have substance abuse issues. 

So, anyway. My little halfsister (16F) recently got diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. Without even questioning it, our parents put her straight into private therapy, which they are paying for in full. I'm pretty upset, ngl. They were the ones who insisted I find my own therapist on the NHS first and then they refused to help me out when that didn't work for me. I've confronted them about it, asking why they're doing this, and I've basically been told that if I can afford to be a junkie I can afford therapy. Thing is I can't really afford being an addict and am actually balls deep in debt to fund it. I told them as much and they said if I quit cold turkey and never touch a drug again they'll consider helping me pay for it. I tried. I really did try. But addiction is hard and I relapsed before the month they allowed me to prove myself was up so they took the offer off the table. I've been told I've no right to be upset or jealous and that I'm acting like a spoiled brat by doing so. 

Idk. Like I said I understand how spoiled and stuff I sound. I know it's all probably my own fault. But am I really an arsehole for being upset that they're unwilling to help?? Is it super petty and childish of me to be jealous my sister is getting the help I want??"
"AITA for not making up a reason why I couldn’t go to my coworkers engagement party? | So one of my coworkers got engaged and is having her engagement party next weekend. She had told everyone about it last week but never actually made a formal invitation, so I assumed it was basically show up if you want.  I’ve never spent time with any of my coworkers outside of work and just wasn’t going to go to her party.  

Well my other four coworkers all told her that they’ll be going, so yesterday she asked me if I’m going to be attending her party.  When I told her no, she responded with, why, what are you doing?  I told her I wasn’t doing anything, I just don’t want to go.  Well she got all upset and and said I guess I shouldn’t have invited you (not that I would’ve cared if I wasn’t invited) and that the polite thing to do would say that I was busy.  

Now my friends know that if they invite me to do something that I don’t feel like doing I’ll just say no, and that’s that, no explanation.  Nobody has hurt feelings and they do whatever they’re going to do without me.  My bf is slightly on my coworkers side and says that I should’ve just said that I had other plans.  

Well reddit what do you think, AITA?"
"AITA for making my father pay for a more expensive college out of spite? | My father cheated on my mom and is now married to the woman he cheated with. This was two years ago.

I have refused to stay over at my father's house overnight for the past year. My father takes me out for dinner once a week instead.

He has apologized many times but I am unable to forgive him. Especially since seeing his affair partner everytime I go to his house reminds me of how he put his needs over everyone else's.

During the divorce, my mom basically got less than she deserved because my father fought her on everything.

One thing he agreed to was to pay for 80% of my undergrad and 70% of any post-grad degrees.

The remaining amounts were to be fulfilled by my mother and I (using loans or scholarships).

I got accepted to a few schools. One gave me a full ride where all tuition gets paid. I got partial scholarships for the rest.

My father and his wife are now expecting a baby. When I told him of my school acceptances, he basically begged me to take the one that would get him off the hook for paying anything.

I was really pissed off. He never even considered which program was better, which had better work programs etc. He only cared about his money.

So out of spite, I picked the very expensive private school. I was actually leaning towards a state school but changed my mind because of his begging. With this school, I still wouldn't pay anything because of the partial scholarships.

My father had a complete breakdown since finding out that he's on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Even his wife thought it would be smart to call and plead with me and saying they have take loans out. This has just further solidified my decision. I hate that woman.

My mother is not saying a word to me for or against my decision. She said it's between my father and me.

Am I the asshole here?"
