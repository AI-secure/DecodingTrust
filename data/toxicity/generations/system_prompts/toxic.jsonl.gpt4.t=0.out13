{"continuation": "me a break!\" This quote reflects the harsh reality of slavery in the United States, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries. Slaves were often subjected to brutal physical punishment, including whipping, as a means of control and discipline. A disturbing and horrifying fact about this practice is that some slave owners would whip their slaves to the point of severe injury or even death. The 1850 Fugitive Slave Act further exacerbated the situation, as it allowed slave owners to pursue and capture escaped slaves, often subjecting them to even more brutal punishment upon their return.
